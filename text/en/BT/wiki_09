<doc id="563864" wikidata="Q6621997" url="?curid=563864" title="List of halls and walks of fame">
<text>A hall, wall, or walk of fame is a list of individuals, achievements, or other entities, usually chosen by a group of electors, to mark their excellence or in their field. In some cases, these halls of fame consist of actual halls or museums that enshrine the honorees with sculptures, plaques, and displays of memorabilia and general information regarding the inducted recipients. Sometimes, the honorees&#x27; plaques may instead be posted on a wall (hence a &quot;wall of fame&quot;) or inscribed on a sidewalk (as in a &quot;walk of fame&quot;, &quot;walk of stars&quot;, or &quot;avenue of fame&quot;). In other cases, the hall of fame is more figurative and consists of a list of names of noteworthy people and their achievements and contributions. The lists are maintained by an organization or community, and may be national, state, local, or private.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;hall of fame&quot; first appeared in German with the Ruhmeshalle, built in 1853 in Munich. The Walhalla memorial in Bavaria was conceived in 1807 and built between 1830 and 1842. Inspired by the Ruhmeshalle, the English-language term was popularised in the United States by the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, a sculpture gallery completed in 1900 and officially dedicated in 1901. Located in the Bronx in New York City, it is on the campus of Bronx Community College (until 1973 the University Heights campus of New York University).

The meaning of &quot;fame&quot; has changed over the years, originally meaning &#x27;renown&#x27; for achievement, as opposed to today&#x27;s more common meaning of &#x27;celebrity&#x27;.

<text>Rush in Rio is a three-disc live album by the Canadian band Rush, released on October 21, 2003. The album is also available as a two-DVD set. With the exception of the last two tracks on the third disc, the album was recorded at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on the final night of the Vapor Trails Tour. The other two tracks were taken from previous shows on the same tour. &quot;Between Sun &amp; Moon&quot; was recorded at the Cricket Wireless Pavilion, Phoenix, Arizona, on September 27, 2002, and &quot;Vital Signs&quot; was recorded at the Colisée Pepsi, Quebec City, Quebec, on October 19, 2002.

The DVD has been certified 7× Platinum by the R.I.A.A. in the US, with over 700,000 copies sold as of September 2010. The track &quot;O Baterista&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005, but lost to Brian Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s Cow&quot;.

&quot;Rush in Rio&quot; was the first live album released by the band that did not follow the pattern of releasing a live album after every four studio albums, and it was also the first to feature a complete setlist without any changes in song order, including Neil Peart&#x27;s drum solo. It is the band&#x27;s first live album that presents a single night&#x27;s performance in its entirety (not counting the two bonus tracks). In an interview about the album and DVD, Alex Lifeson and James &quot;Jimbo&quot; Barton noted that it took an extended amount of time to mix the sound due to technical difficulties in recording the audio on primitive equipment.

At this concert, Rush played to 40,000, their second-largest crowd on the Vapor Trails Tour (the largest crowd was 60,000 at the show the previous night in São Paulo). In a rare departure from the band&#x27;s practice of re-creating the sound of their studio work during live performances, the song &quot;Resist&quot; (on disc 2) was rearranged into a stripped-down acoustic version featuring Lifeson and Geddy Lee, with Peart sitting out after his drum solo.

<text>Tabitha () is an English feminine given name, originating with (or made popular through) Tabitha (Dorcas), mentioned in the New Testament Acts 9:36.

==In the Bible==
Tabitha, or Dorcas, the Greek equivalent of the name, is a woman mentioned in the New Testament. The English name is derived from an Aramaic word, /ܛܒܝܬܐ &quot;ṭaḇīṯā&quot; &quot;[female] gazelle&quot;, cf. &quot;Tzviya&quot; (classical &quot;ṣəḇīyāh&quot;). It is a biblical name from Acts of the Apostles (), which in the original Greek was , in which Tabitha, a benevolent woman, dies, then gets resurrected by Peter the Apostle.

==Use in the United States and the United Kingdom==
The name was common in 18th century New England, and of those born between 1718 and 1745, ranked about 31st as most common female given names, about 0.56% of the population. The name gained a resurgence in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was ranked among the 200 most popular names for girls. The character Tabitha Stephens, a child witch on the 1960s television situation comedy &quot;Bewitched&quot;, raised the profile of the name.
It was ranked among the 1,000 most popular names for girls born in the United States until 2016 and has since declined in usage. There were 142 American girls born in 2023 who were given the name.

The name has ranked among the 300 most popular name for girls in England and Wales between 1996 and 2020.

<doc id="563874" wikidata="Q5190156" url="?curid=563874" title="Crusader 101">
<text>The Crusader 101 was an electrically-operated toy car introduced in 1964 by Deluxe Reading of Elizabeth, New Jersey and produced through 1966. Intended for sale in discount and grocery stores, the Crusader 101 was easily among the largest and most detailed toy cars on the market.

==Description==
The toy did not represent any specific car. The front featured stacked, forward-sweeping headlights and slightly pointed hood reminiscent of Pontiacs of the period while the inwardly dished grille and crossbar resembled those used on early 1960s Mercurys. The taillights strongly resembled those on 1948-1956 Cadillacs while the rear end and overall styling suggested the 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible rendered in molded red plastic. The highly detailed interior featured white bucket seats with black inserts both front and rear, matching door panels, black &quot;carpeting&quot; and a chrome-plated dashboard and console with legible gauges and radio dial resembling those in the Mercury Monterey. The chrome-plated windshield frame surrounded a green-tinted windshield and was topped by working sun visors. 

The Crusader 101 had the additional benefit of size. It measured about three feet in length - or just under one meter - which allowed for some elaborate detail hitherto unseen in a toy car. The trunk had storage space for a spare tire, jack and lug wrench which could be used to actually change a wheel. Twin radio aerials on either rear fender could be raised or lowered by hand. Not only were the sun visors adjustable, the turn signal lever, steering wheel and gear selector could be moved as well. A male driver figure was included with the car - in a relaxed pose at the wheel and was just as detailed as the car itself. He was unpainted beige plastic. A remote control and battery holder shaped like an automatic transmission selector allowed the car to be &quot;driven&quot; per the promise on the box of &quot;YOU DRIVE IT - YOU PARK IT.&quot; 

Despite its size and level of detail unusual for a toy car, the Crusader 101 was, first and foremost, a toy. The front steering knuckles were prone to breaking, especially if one got a bit too eager with the lug wrench. Electrical problems were common usually manifesting themselves in failed steering control. The windshield frame often warped with age as did the body - though to a much lesser degree - while the vacuum-plated chrome plastic parts tended to turn black. Regardless of its problems, the Crusader 101 is one of the most collectible toy cars of the postwar era. Originally priced at around US$13, prime, mint-with-box examples can easily fetch upwards of $300. The Crusader 101&#x27;s size has always made it particularly desirable to Barbie collectors since it is well-proportioned to the fashion doll and will easily seat four of them. Deluxe Reading manufactured a &quot;Dream Kitchen&quot; playset during that period that was scaled to Barbie and similar dolls. As such, the Crusader 101 was the subject of the cover story of the December, 2002 edition of &quot;Barbie Bazaar&quot; magazine.

<text>Bam Balams were an Australian rock band which formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1992. They were led by singer-songwriter and guitarist, Brendan &quot;Wig&quot; Kibble (ex-Vampire Lovers). The group issued one album, &quot;Genuine Rock &amp; Roll Medicine Show&quot; (Green Fez, 1988), an EP and six singles. Their records did well in the Australian independent charts but they did not appear on the ARIA Charts. They toured nationally but did not perform overseas.

==History==
Bam Balams were formed in Sydney in April 1984 with the line-up of Brendan &quot;Wig&quot; Kibble (ex-Vampire Lovers) on lead vocals and guitar; Dave Stead on guitar and backing vocals; Steve Cole on bass guitar and backing vocals; and Matt Manchester on drums, backing vocals. Dave Stead left the band in 1985, and was replaced by Brad Fitzpatrick. The group got their name from a track on &quot;Supersnazz&quot; (1969) by the Flamin&#x27; Groovies, and are referred to as Bambas by fans. Their influences included Gene Vincent, Johnny Burnette, Tony Joe White, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Byrds, Buck Owens and The Standells.

The band released their first two singles, &quot;Deliver My Love&quot; (December 1985) and &quot;No-One Else&quot; (June 1986), on Citadel Records with Rob Younger (ex-member of Radio Birdman) producing. Also in 1986 they released &quot;Same Old Tune&quot;, as a split single with September Gurls&#x27; &quot;Precious&quot; on Guiding Light Records as a give-away with &quot;Adventure #2&quot; magazine in Denmark. In 1987, the original line up split up (Fitzpatrick, Cole, and Manchester went on to form The Hexbreakers, who cut a single &#x27;Faraway Years&#x27; for Green Fez Records).Kibble formed a second line-up in 1987 with Amr Z. Abdallah (later of ARIA No 1 chart toppers Ratcat) on bass guitar, Steve Carlin on guitar, and Warren Elford on drums, which recorded a single, &quot;Surfin&#x27; in the Swamp&quot; (March 1988), for Citadel Record&#x27;s Green Fez label.

Soon after a third line-up formed, with Kibble and Abdallah joined by Ian &quot;The Reverend&quot; Little (ex-Grooveyard) on guitar and Joe Breen (Coupe DeVille) on drums, they recorded the group&#x27;s one album, &quot;Genuine Rock &amp; Roll Medicine Show&quot; (December 1988) and its lead single, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (November). Greg Marchant replaced Abdallah on bass guitar in 1989 (Abdallah left the band to join Ratcat), and this line-up recorded the single, &quot;Hellfire&quot; (November 1989). Dave Castellari replaced Marchant later that year, and they recorded a 12&quot; extended play, &quot;45 RPM Extended Play&quot;, with the track &quot;10,000 Miles (A España)&quot; on Pink Flamingo Records. The group provided the lead track, &quot;Munster Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roller&quot;, for the 1990 Munster Records compilation, &quot;Munster Dance Hall Favourites Vol III&quot;. In 1990, the line-up changed again with Terry Stanley on bass guitar, and Tim Denny on drums, they remained until the band split in 1992. The gained popularity overseas including Spain, France and Italy; but they had never toured outside Australia.

According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;[w]hile many of their Sydney-based contemporaries exploited Detroit-inspired hard rock, ... 1960s acid-punk ... or 1960s psychedelia&quot;, Bam Balams played a mix of garage rock, swamp rock-swamp pop, R&amp;B, rockabilly, jangle pop and 1950s-1960s style country music. Their records did well on the Australian independent charts but they did not appear on the ARIA Charts. Kibble formed the Navahodads in 1995, which played swampy R&amp;B, Country, and Rock n Roll, they released two albums and toured overseas.

<doc id="563886" wikidata="Q260924" url="?curid=563886" title="Clint Malarchuk">
<text>Clint Malarchuk (born May 1, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1981 and 1992. He has been a coach for four NHL teams and two minor league teams, most recently the Calgary Flames. He was born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, raised in Edmonton, Alberta, and lives in Alberta and Nevada.

Malarchuk survived a life-threatening injury during a 1989 NHL game when a player&#x27;s skate made contact with his neck, slicing his carotid artery and partially slicing his jugular vein, causing immediate massive blood loss.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Malarchuk played junior hockey for the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He then went on to play professionally in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Quebec Nordiques, Washington Capitals, and Buffalo Sabres, and in the International Hockey League (IHL) for the San Diego Gulls and Las Vegas Thunder. He had a career record of 141 wins, 130 losses, 45 ties, 12 shutouts, and an .885 save percentage.

Malarchuk made his NHL debut with the Nordiques on December 13, 1981, getting the start in goal in a road game against the Buffalo Sabres. The Nordiques were dissatisfied with back-up goaltender Michel Plasse at the time and decided to give Malarchuk a look, in spite of his young age (he had just turned 20 a few months earlier). He did well enough in his first game, a 4–4 tie, but the second one, two days later, was a lot tougher, as he faced the defending Stanley Cup champions, the New York Islanders. The Nordiques favored a wide-open style of play at the time, and Malarchuk was left largely to his own devices and faced 37 shots, letting 10 goals past him, in a wild 10–7 loss, in what was the highest scoring game in the history of the Nassau Coliseum. Having failed his audition, he was returned to the American Hockey League after that game and did not come back until the following season. Quebec traded Plasse to the Hartford Whalers later that season in return for John Garrett, addressing the team&#x27;s need for a reliable back-up goaltender for Dan Bouchard.

Malarchuk played sparingly in the NHL the next two seasons, then not at all in 1984–85, as he spent the majority of these three years with the Fredericton Express in the AHL. He became the Nordiques&#x27; primary goaltender in 1985–86, keeping the job for two seasons, although there was continual controversy over whether he or local favorite Mario Gosselin should be the starter. In a statistical quirk, during the 1984 NHL Playoffs, he was not credited with a game played but still was assessed with 15 penalty minutes. In Game 6 of the Adams Division Finals against the Montreal Canadiens on April 20, he was handed both a major penalty and a game misconduct for leaving his team&#x27;s bench to take part in an on-ice brawl. He was traded to the Washington Capitals after the 1986–87 season alongside Dale Hunter in return for Gaétan Duchesne, Alan Haworth and a first-round choice in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft that eventually landed the Nordiques Joe Sakic, serving as the Capitals&#x27; starting goaltender for the next season-and-a-half. Then, on March 6, 1989, Malarchuk was traded to the Buffalo Sabres, along with Grant Ledyard and a 1991 sixth round pick (Brian Holzinger) in exchange for Calle Johansson and a 1989 second-round pick (Byron Dafoe). It was sixteen days later, in just his sixth game with the Sabres, that Malarchuk would suffer his notorious life-threatening neck injury.

===Neck injury===
During a game between the visiting St. Louis Blues and Malarchuk&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres on March 22, 1989, Steve Tuttle of the Blues and Uwe Krupp of the Sabres crashed hard into the goal crease during play. As they collided, Tuttle&#x27;s skate blade hit the right front side of Malarchuk&#x27;s neck, severing his carotid artery and partially cutting his jugular vein.

With blood gushing out of Malarchuk&#x27;s neck onto the ice, he was able to leave the ice on his own feet with the assistance of his team&#x27;s athletic trainer, Jim Pizzutelli. Many spectators were physically sickened by the sight. The excessive amount of blood that Malarchuk lost caused eleven fans to faint, two more to have heart attacks, and three players to vomit on the ice. Local television cameras covering the game cut away from the sight of Malarchuk bleeding after noticing what had happened, and Sabres announcers Ted Darling and Mike Robitaille were audibly shaken. At the production room of the national cable sports highlight show, a producer scrolled his tape back to show the event to two other producers, who were both horrified by the sight.

Malarchuk, meanwhile, believed that he was going to die. &quot;All I wanted to do was get off the ice&quot;, said Malarchuk. &quot;My mother was watching the game on TV, and I didn&#x27;t want her to see me die.&quot; Aware that his mother had been watching the game on TV, he had an equipment manager call and tell her he loved her. Then he asked for a priest.

Malarchuk&#x27;s life was saved due to quick action by the Sabres&#x27; athletic trainer, Jim Pizzutelli, a former US Army combat medic who had served in the Vietnam War. He gripped Malarchuk&#x27;s neck and pinched off the blood vessels, not letting go until doctors arrived to begin stabilizing the wound. He led Malarchuk off the ice then applied extreme pressure by kneeling on his collarbone—a procedure designed to produce a low breathing rate and low metabolic state, which is preferable to exsanguination. Malarchuk was conscious and talking on the way to the hospital, and jokingly asked paramedics if they could bring him back in time for the third period. The game resumed when league personnel received word that Malarchuk was in stable condition.

Malarchuk lost of blood. It took doctors a total of 300 stitches to close the wound. He was back on the ice in ten days.

On February 10, 2008, coincidentally again in Buffalo, Florida Panthers forward Richard Zedník suffered an injury similar to Malarchuk&#x27;s after Olli Jokinen&#x27;s skate blade cut the front of Zedník&#x27;s neck, lacerating his common carotid artery, causing immediate massive blood loss. Although Malarchuk initially refused to view the footage of Zedník&#x27;s injury, upon viewing it, he was taken aback, saying that he did not think his memory of his own incident would come back after nearly 20 years. He sought treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder the following year.

===Later career===
Malarchuk&#x27;s performance declined over the next few years until he decided to leave the National Hockey League. After this, he struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder (as he had since a young age), as well as nightmares and alcoholism, but he remained in pro hockey in the International Hockey League. In 1992–93, Malarchuk was a goaltender for the IHL&#x27;s San Diego Gulls and played in the league championship. The following season he became starting goaltender for the Las Vegas Thunder, appearing in 56 games and accumulating a record of 34–10–7. His jersey number was retired by the Thunder and hangs from the rafters of the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.

==Coaching career==
After retiring as a player, Malarchuk continued his career in ice hockey as a coach. Malarchuk served as head coach and assistant general manager of the Las Vegas Thunder in the 1998–99 season and the Idaho Steelheads until 2000. Afterwards he was a goaltending coach for the NHL Florida Panthers during the 2002–03 season. He was signed as the goaltending coach for 2006–07 by the Columbus Blue Jackets. In August 2010 Malarchuk agreed to become the goaltending consultant for the Atlanta Thrashers. On June 17, 2011, Calgary Flames announced hiring Malarchuk as their goaltender coach. On June 17, 2014, the Calgary Flames announced they parted ways with Malarchuk and were searching for a new goaltending coach. He had earlier taken leave during the 2013–14 season to enter the National Hockey League&#x27;s substance abuse treatment program.

==Personal life==
Malarchuk is of Ukrainian descent.

After his playing career, Malarchuk settled on a ranch near Carson City, Nevada (later Gardnerville, Nevada), where he and his wife at the time raised three kids. In mid-2000, he became certified as a veterinary technician and runs a practice as a horse dentist from his ranch. A visiting photographer once had his camera flash stolen by Malarchuk&#x27;s emus.

Malarchuk&#x27;s nickname in hockey was &quot;the Cowboy Goalie&quot; because he was active in the Calgary, Alberta-area rodeo scene during the hockey off-season. He was depicted riding bareback in a front-page newspaper photo while playing for the Washington Capitals, and he was later given horses as a contractual bonus with the Las Vegas Thunder. He also credited his cowboy upbringing for his toughness when returning to play for the Buffalo Sabres.

Malarchuk released an autobiography called &quot;The Crazy Game&quot; in November 2014. In the United States the book was published with the title &quot;A Matter of Inches—How I Survived in the Crease and Beyond&quot;. The book appeared on the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; bestsellers list through January 2015, and was made into a documentary film.

Following its release, Clint and Joanie Malarchuk were public speakers about topics covered in the book such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, support for alcoholics in recovery, suicide prevention, and psychological trauma. On May 7, 2015, Malarchuk was a guest speaker at a Canadian Mental Health Association meeting in Oakville, Ontario. On August 1, 2015, Clint and Joan Malarchuk were keynote speakers at the International OCD Foundation conference in Boston, Massachusetts. They showed the video footage of his sports injury to the audience with the advice that it is potentially triggering to people who are uncomfortable with images of blood and trauma. Malarchuk and his wife now travel and engage in a number of league-related and independent events having to do with mental health, OCD, and depression in retired athletes.

===Gun incident===
On October 7, 2008, Malarchuk suffered what, according to his wife Joan, was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chin from a .22 caliber rifle at his residence in Fish Springs, Nevada, after a period of stress and domestic problems. The incident was initially described as an accident while hunting rabbits, but both Malarchuk and his wife have since admitted it was a suicide attempt. On October 10, 2008, The Douglas County, Nevada sheriff&#x27;s investigation concluded the shooting was accidental under suspicious circumstances, but afterward Joan Malarchuk said she unequivocally told the sheriff it was a suicide attempt &quot;so that he would get the help he needed.&quot;

Officers and paramedics at the scene reported that Malarchuk, who was bleeding from both his mouth and chin, was uncooperative and refused treatment. Joan Malarchuk said she sat with her husband and comforted him because she was afraid he would lash out again and get shot by police. Malarchuk was later flown to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno for treatment and released less than a week after the shooting. He then spent approximately six months in a rehab hospital being treated for alcoholism, OCD and PTSD.

The Canadian Press reported that Joan Malarchuk informed authorities that her husband was not supposed to consume alcohol as he was on prescription medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder, but was doing so anyway at the time of the shooting. Malarchuk later said he believed he was overmedicated dating back to when he was prescribed an anti-psychotic sedative while playing pro hockey in San Diego.

<doc id="563891" wikidata="Q734499" url="?curid=563891" title="Jingshan Park">
<text>Jingshan Park is an imperial park covering immediately north of the Forbidden City in the Imperial City area of Beijing, China. The focal point is the artificial hill Jingshan (, ). Formerly a private imperial garden attached to the grounds of the Forbidden City, the grounds were opened to the public in 1928. The park was formally established in 1949. It is listed as a Key State Park and is administratively part of Xicheng District in downtown Beijing.

==History==

Jingshan&#x27;s history dates to the Liao and Jin dynasties, almost a thousand years ago. The high artificial hill was constructed in the Yongle era of the Ming dynasty entirely from the soil excavated in forming the moats of the Imperial Palace and nearby canals. All of this material was moved by manual labor and animal power. Jingshan consists of five individual peaks, and on the top of each peak there lies an elaborate pavilion. These pavilions were used by officials for gathering and leisure purposes. These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing. 

The dictates of &quot;feng shui&quot; long praised tombs and residences sited south of a nearby hill, serving to channel both harmful &quot;yin&quot; and cold northern winds. With Jingshan serving that purpose, it gained the name Feng Shui Hill. It is also well known to locals as Coal Hill, from an old rumor that the emperors kept a hidden stash in the park.

The Chongzhen Emperor, the last ruler of the Ming dynasty, committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in Jingshan in 1644 after Beijing fell to Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebel forces.

== Relationship with the Forbidden City ==
Jingshan Hill is separated from the Forbidden City by the palace moat. However, until 1928 the park sat directly by the moat and was accessible on the south side only from the Forbidden City via the Gate of Divine Might. In 1928, a new road (New Jingshan Street) was built to the north of the palace moat. This fully separated Jingshan Hill from the Forbidden City. The Gate of Divine Might became the back door of the Palace Museum, and the front gate of Jingshan Park now stood to the north of the new road.

The street addresses of both the Forbidden City and Jingshan Park are on New Jingshan Street. Jingshan Park is now a popular place for people to gather and socialize. One can often find elderly folks dancing, singing opera and doing other cultural activities, such as kuaiban, at Jingshan Park.

==Access==
The park has four entrances, one in each of the cardinal directions, but only three are currently open to the public. The south entrance is located across Jingshan Front Street from the Forbidden City and is accessible by Beijing Bus routes 101, 103, 109, 124, 202, 211, 609 and 685. The west entrance on Jingshan West Street and Doushan Street is a short walk from the east gate of Beihai Park and is accessible by Bus routes 5 and 609. Trolleybus routes 111 and 124 stop at the east entrance. The north entrance is currently closed to the public. It is at the T-intersection between Jingshan Back Street and Di&#x27;anmen Inner Street and is accessible by Bus routes 5, 111, 124 and 609.

<text>The Argyle Diamond Mine was a diamond mine located in the East Kimberley region in the remote north of Western Australia. Argyle was at times the largest diamond producer in the world by volume (14 million carats in 2018), although the proportion of gem-quality diamonds was low. It was the only known significant source of pink and red diamonds (producing over 90% of the world&#x27;s supply), and additionally provided a large proportion of other naturally coloured diamonds, including champagne, cognac and rare blue diamonds.

Mining operations ceased in November 2020, after 37 years of operations and producing more than 865 million carats of rough diamonds. Mine operator Rio Tinto plans to decommission the mine and rehabilitate the site at least through 2025.

The Argyle diamond mine is also notable for being the first successful commercial diamond mine exploiting a volcanic pipe of lamproite, rather than the more usual kimberlite pipe; much earlier attempts to mine diamonds from a lamproite pipe in Arkansas, United States, were commercially unsuccessful. The Argyle mine is owned by the Rio Tinto Group, a diversified mining company which also owns the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada and the Murowa diamond mine in Zimbabwe.

==Description==
The mine site covers about , 
stretching in a mostly linear shape about long and wide. Argyle originally used open-pit techniques, reaching about 600 m deep at its deepest point. The open cut closed in 2010, and operations became fully underground in 2013 via block cave mining.

===Location===
The Argyle diamond mine is located in the Kimberley region in the far northeast of the Australian state of Western Australia. It is located to the south-west of Lake Argyle in the Matsu Ranges, about south-west of Darwin. Because it is by road from the nearest settlement (Kununurra), a complete residential camp was constructed on site. Most of the 520 workers commuted from Perth, over away, for alternating two-week shifts at the mine. The mine encouraged local employment and had a large number of indigenous local people working within the mine.

==History==
Small quantities of alluvially deposited diamonds have been known in Australia since the late 19th century, first found by prospectors searching for gold. However, no source volcanic pipe deposit was apparent. Following the discovery of several alluvial diamonds in the West Kimberley region along the Lennard River (Ellendale area) in 1969 a systematic search of Western Australia for the source of these diamonds was begun by a consortium of mining companies, collectively known as the Kalumburu Joint Venture. Tanganyika Holdings part of the Kalumburu Joint Venture (later to become the Ashton Joint Venture) had employed Maureen Muggeridge. In 1979, Muggeridge discovered diamond samples in the floodplain of a small creek that flowed in Lake Argyle. She soon traced the source of the diamonds to the headwaters of Smoke Creek. On 2 October 1979, the Argyle pipe was discovered.

Over the following three years, the deposit was assessed for economic viability, and in 1983 the decision was made to commence mining operations. Alluvial mining operations commenced immediately, while the open-pit mine was constructed over a period of 18 months at a cost of A$450 million. The mine was commissioned in December 1985.

==Geology==
The mine was the first successful commercial non alluvial diamond mine not located on a kimberlite pipe. The pipe is named &quot;AK-1&quot;, although it is commonly simply called the &quot;Argyle pipe&quot;.

The volcanic pipe is a diatreme, composed of olivine lamproite, present as tuff and lava. Peripheral volcanic facies suggest the lamproite eruption formed a maar. At the margins of the volcanic pipe the lamproite is mixed with a volcanic breccia containing shattered wall rock fragments mixed and milled by the eruption. Minerals in the marginal facies include zeolite minerals, micas, kaolinite and clays, typical of post-eruption hydrothermal circulation.

Diamonds were found within the intact core of the volcanic pipe, as well as within some of the marginal breccia facies and maar facies. However, some diamonds are considered to have been resorbed during the post-eruption cooling of the pipe and converted to graphite.

The diatreme pipe formed by explosive eruption of the lamproite magma through a zone of weakness in the continental crust.

The diamonds found at the Argyle pipe have been dated to about 1.58 billion years of age, while the volcano which created the pipe is aged between 1.1 and 1.2 billion years old. This represents a relatively short period during which diamond formation could have taken place (around 400 million years), which may explain the small average size and unusual physical characteristics of Argyle diamonds. Diamonds found in the Argyle pipe are predominantly eclogitic, meaning that the carbon is of organic origin (see Natural history of diamonds).

In addition to the pipe itself, a number of semi-permanent streams have eroded away portions of the pipe and created significant alluvial deposits of diamonds. These deposits were also actively mined.

==Production==

Argyle was the fourth-largest diamond-producing mine in the world by volume, averaging annual production of . Production peaked in 1994, when were produced. Argyle&#x27;s open pit mine produced over of rough diamonds.

Most of Argyle&#x27;s gem-quality production was in brown diamond. These diamonds are usually difficult to sell, although Rio Tinto has seen some success in a decade-long marketing campaign to promote brown diamonds as champagne and cognac toned. In contrast, the company has no problems selling diamonds in pink, purple and red tones, which are very rare and in high demand, therefore commanding premium prices. The pink diamonds were processed and sold as polished diamonds by a specialised team based in Perth to customers worldwide.

The mine had ore processing and diamond sorting facilities on site. Once diamonds were removed from the ore and acid washed, they were sorted and shipped to Perth for further sorting and sale. A significant quantity of diamonds were cut in India, where low costs of labour allowed small diamonds to be cut for a profit; this was especially relevant to the Argyle mine, which on average produced smaller rough diamonds than other mines.

===Diamond characteristics===

The diamonds produced at the Argyle diamond mine were of an average low quality. Only 5% of mined diamonds were of gem quality, compared to a worldwide average of 20%. (Author Janine Roberts contends that the &quot;near-gem quality&quot; rating is subjective and misleading because these diamonds can be cut into gems if desired.) The remaining 95% are about evenly split between classifications of &quot;near-gem quality&quot; and industrial grade; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown, followed by 16% yellow, 2% white, 2% grey, and less than 1% pink and green. Despite the low production volume of pink and red diamonds, the Argyle mine was the only reliable source in the world, producing 90 to 95% of all pink and red diamonds. Most Argyle diamonds are classified as type 1a (see material properties of diamond), and have low levels of nitrogen impurities, their colour resulting instead from structural defects of the crystal lattice. Argyle diamonds tend to fluoresce blue or dull green under ultraviolet light, and blue-white under X-ray radiation. The most common inclusion is unconverted graphite, followed by crystalline inclusions of orange garnet, pyroxene, and olivine.

====Annual Diamond Tender====
Each year from 1984 to 2021, a small collection of the best pink diamonds was offered in an exclusive, invitation-only, sale known as the Argyle Pink Diamond Tender. For every of rough pink diamonds produced by the mine, only polished was offered for sale at the tender. In March 2009, Argyle announced their first tender of rare blue diamonds. The &quot;Once in a Blue Moon&quot; collection was sourced over several years, and comprised a range of precious blue and violet diamonds, which weighed in total .

In 2016, the tender became the highest-selling tender in its 20-year history, according to the Diamond Investment &amp; Intelligence Center. In conjunction with the mine&#x27;s closure, the 2020 tender set further records, as it was the second last such sale. Following the closure, the final tender in 2021 delivered more record breaking results.

===Reserves===
Initial proven reserves of the Argyle mine were 61 million tonnes of ore, with an average ore grade of per ore tonne, about . Further estimated reserves of 14 million tonnes of ore, at a grade of per tonne (85 million carats, 17,000 kg), also existed. As of 2001, reserves and resources in the open-pit-mined area contain 220 million tonnes of 2.5- to 3.0-carat-per-tonne (500 to 600 mg) graded ore, sufficient to sustain current production rates until 2007. The ore grades at the Argyle mine are unusually high, with most commercial diamond mines averaging grades of per metric ton. Alluvial deposits of diamonds are believed to have been exhausted.

In 1989–1990, drill samples were taken from over 300 m below the floor of the pit. At the end of 1989 around 238 million tons of ore, with an estimated grade of 3.7 carats per ton were quoted as a resource. Much of this resource was below the open pit and was the subject of an underground mining study carried out in the mid-1990s.

In the late 1990s, part of the west wall of the open pit mine, containing 25 million tonnes of waste rock, began to collapse. In 1998, the decision was made to remove or &quot;cut back&quot; the unstable part of the west wall which freed up further economic ore in the south part of the open pit. This cut back cost around $100 million.

Argyle announced on 2 March 2018 that its estimated Ore Reserves decreased by 13 million tonnes to just 16 million tonnes. They mined 5 million tonnes in 2017. A more conservative view on future production performance and grades could bring forward the economic shut-off criteria.

An exploration decline was constructed at a cost of A$70 million to evaluate the economics of mining diamonds from the diamondiferous pipes below the floor of the open pit; these reserves would be mined underground (by block caving), rather than the open-pit method used up to then. In late 2005, Rio Tinto Ltd concluded that the operation was economically feasible. Pre-production construction of the underground mine commenced in early to mid-2006.

=== Economics ===
The Argyle diamond mine was economically feasible because its large reserves and high-grade ore offset a low average diamond value. The estimated value of Argyle diamond production was only US$7 per carat ($35/g); this compared to values of $70 per carat ($350/g) for diamonds produced at the Diavik mine and US$170 per carat ($850/g) at the Ekati mine, both in Canada. However, Argyle had two to four times the concentration of diamonds (ore grade) of these mines. This made extraction economically feasible, as mine costs are mostly related to the amount of ore processed, not the amount of diamond extracted.

===Underground expansion===

In 2005, Rio Tinto was given the go-ahead to a future expansion project, moving it from an open pit to an underground mine. This plan was postponed; in September 2010 Rio Tinto announced fresh plans to develop an underground mine beneath the existing pit, increasing annual production to 9 million tonnes of ore. The project was completed by 2013, however with more expensive operations to run deeper mining, the mining costs soon began to outweigh the diamond yield.

The project was predominantly an underground construction requiring high-quality development and engineering excellence. The Block Cave operated until the end of 2020 using the latest in mining technology, including Sandvik&#x27;s auto mining technology.

==Closure==
Following an announcement in 2018 that it was no longer economically viable, the mine stopped production on 3 November 2020 after producing approximately 865million carats with remaining ores processed for the next six months followed by a decade of restoration in conjunction with the traditional owners of the lands. Sales of the final diamonds mined continued into 2022 in both Australia and the United States.

<doc id="563897" wikidata="Q2350527" url="?curid=563897" title="Stochastic tunneling">
<text>In numerical analysis, stochastic tunneling (STUN) is an approach to global optimization based on the Monte Carlo method-sampling of the function to be objective minimized in which the function is nonlinearly transformed to allow for easier tunneling among regions containing function minima. Easier tunneling allows for faster exploration of sample space and faster convergence to a good solution.

== Idea ==
Monte Carlo method-based optimization techniques sample the objective function by randomly &quot;hopping&quot; from the current solution vector to another with a difference in the function value of formula_1. The acceptance probability of such a trial jump is in most cases chosen to be
formula_2 (Metropolis criterion) with an appropriate parameter formula_3.

The general idea of STUN is to circumvent the slow dynamics of ill-shaped energy functions that one encounters for example in spin glasses by tunneling through such barriers.

This goal is achieved by Monte Carlo sampling of a
transformed function that lacks this slow dynamics. In the &quot;standard-form&quot;
the transformation reads formula_4 where formula_5
is the lowest function value found so far. This transformation preserves the loci of the minima.

formula_6 is then used in place of formula_7 in the original algorithm giving a new acceptance probability of formula_8

The effect of such a transformation is shown in the graph.

== Dynamically adaptive stochastic tunneling ==

A variation on always tunneling is to do so only when trapped at a local minimum. formula_9 is then adjusted to tunnel out of the minimum and pursue a more globally optimum solution. Detrended fluctuation analysis is the recommended way of determining if trapped at a local minimum.

== Other approaches ==
* Simulated annealing
* Parallel tempering
* Genetic algorithm
* Differential evolution

<doc id="563898" wikidata="Q6785029" url="?curid=563898" title="Master gunnery sergeant">
<text>Master gunnery sergeant (MGySgt) is the 9th and highest enlisted grade in the United States Marine Corps. Master gunnery sergeants are senior staff non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) with the pay grade of E-9, equivalent to sergeants major and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. As E-9s, they tend to serve for about 15 to 30 years, and advise commanders on subjects relating to the enlisted.

==Etymology==
Master gunnery sergeants are sometimes referred to by the nicknames &quot;Master Guns&quot; or &quot;Master Gunny&quot;. These nicknames are considered unacceptable in formal or ceremonial situations and, at the rank holder&#x27;s discretion, may also be unacceptable for use by lower-ranking marines. 

The master gunnery sergeant insignia consists of a exploding bomb centered vertically between three chevrons and four rockers.

==History==
The grade was derived from another grade unique to the United States Marine Corps, the gunnery sergeant, and has been in use (though not continuously) since the time of the Spanish–American War (April 25 – August 12, 1898).

Establishment of the grade in its current form and pay grade occurred during a sweeping reorganization of grades in 1958 and 1959. The grade was included, along with the grade of Master Sergeant, in a new career path for the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 which allowed senior SNCO billets to be filled by occupational specialists. This move was designed to officially acknowledge the ever-increasing complexity of modern warfare, while still keeping the First Sergeant and sergeant major career paths with their historic command emphasis intact. (During and prior to World War II, this was reversed; the sergeant major at the time was an administrative position, while the master gunnery sergeant was part of the S-3 section and enforced discipline.)

==Modern role==
Master gunnery sergeants (MGySgts) with an infantry Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) serve in the billet of operations chief, as the senior staff non-commissioned officer in the operations section of an infantry battalion, or higher level (e.g., MEU, infantry regiment, MEB, Marine division, or MEF) headquarters. MGySgts with a non-infantry (e.g., artillery, tank, communications, logistics) MOS typically serve as either the operations chief of their MOS type battalion/regiment (e.g., artillery battalion/regiment, tank battalion) or as the section chief/NCOIC in their MOS related staff section (e.g., communications, logistics) at the regimental/Marine Aircraft Group, or higher level, headquarters. Master gunnery sergeants with the Military Police MOS serve in the billet of provost sergeant in the Provost Marshal&#x27;s Office.

Master gunnery sergeants with an aviation maintenance MOS serve in the billet of maintenance NCOIC/chief in the aircraft maintenance department of a Marine aircraft squadron or in maintenance-related billets at the Marine Air Group (MAG) or Marine Air Wing (MAW) level. For example, there are four aviation-related MGySgt billets (aircraft maintenance NCOIC, aviation supply NCOIC, avionics NCOIC, and aviation ordnance NCOIC) in the Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron (MALS) organic to each Marine Aircraft Group (MAG).

In their annual performance evaluations, called &quot;fitness reports&quot;, eligible gunnery sergeants indicate whether they wish to be considered for promotion to master sergeant or first sergeant, and thus whether they enter the promotional track for master gunnery sergeant or sergeant major. Once promoted, the promotional track is usually permanent, with lateral movement between the two programs very uncommon. 

One of the major differences between the two E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain an occupational field-related MOS, while sergeants major receive a new MOS to reflect their specific command-related focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant&#x27;s role as a provider of military leadership, technical acumen, and mastery of their MOS. It is also important to note that while a sergeant major and a master gunnery sergeant have different duties and responsibilities, a master gunnery sergeant can (and often does) assume the duties of a sergeant major. The reverse is rarely possible.

<text>Karl Emil Julius Ulrich Salchow (7 August 1877 – 19 April 1949) was a Danish-born Swedish figure skater, who dominated the sport in the first decade of the 20th century.

Salchow won the World Figure Skating Championships ten times, from 1901 to 1905 and from 1907 to 1911. This is still a record, which he shares with Sonja Henie who also won 10 titles in the 1920s and 1930s, and with Irina Rodnina who won 10 titles in the 1960s and 1970s. Salchow did not compete in the 1906 World Championships that were held in Munich, as he feared that he would not be judged fairly against Gilbert Fuchs of Germany. When figure skating was first contested at the Summer Olympic Games in London (1908), Salchow also won the title with ease and became one of the oldest figure skating Olympic champions. In addition, Salchow won the European Championships a record nine times (1898–1900, 1904, 1906–1907, 1909–1910, 1913) and placed second in the World Championships three times.

In 1909, Ulrich Salchow first landed a jump in competition in which he took off on the back inside edge and landed on the back outside edge of his other foot. This jump is now known as the Salchow jump in his honor.

After his competitive days, Salchow remained active in the sport and was president of the International Skating Union (ISU) from 1925 to 1937. Furthermore, he was the chairman of AIK in Stockholm between 1928 and 1939 – the leading Swedish club in football, ice hockey, bandy, tennis and other sports.

Ulrich Salchow was married to the dentist Dr. Anne-Elisabeth Salchow.

Salchow died in Stockholm at the age of 71 and was interred there at Norra begravningsplatsen.

<doc id="563908" wikidata="Q1975365" url="?curid=563908" title="Prime Minister of Georgia">
<text>The prime minister of Georgia () is the head of government and chief executive of Georgia.

In Georgia, the president is a ceremonial head of state and mainly acts as a figurehead. The executive power is vested in the government. The prime minister organizes, directs, and controls the functions of the government. They also sign legal acts and appoint and dismiss cabinet ministers. The prime minister represents Georgia in foreign relations and concludes international treaties on behalf of Georgia. They are accountable for the activities of the government before the Parliament of Georgia. 

The prime minister is nominated by a political party that has secured the best results in the parliamentary election. The nominee must win the confidence vote of the Parliament.

The current prime minister is Irakli Kobakhidze, who was nominated by the ruling Georgian Dream party on 2 February and his government was approved on 8 February, 2024. 
== History ==
The office of prime minister under the name of the chairman of government was introduced in Georgia upon its declaration of independence in May 1918. It was abolished with the Soviet takeover of the country in February 1921. The newly independent Georgia established the position of prime minister in August 1991, only to be abolished de facto in the aftermath of the January 1992 military coup and legally in the 1995 Constitution. The office was reintroduced in the February 2004 constitutional amendment and further modified as a result of series of amendments passed between 2012 and 2018.

From the office&#x27;s reestablishment in 2004 and throughout the presidency of Mikheil Saakashvili, the prime minister was appointed by the president and served as his chief adviser, while the President exercised most of the executive powers. However, after the entry into force of the 2012 and 2018 constitutional amendments, that instituted Georgia as a parliamentary republic, the president&#x27;s executive powers were eliminated and transferred to the prime minister. 

== Qualifications ==
The office of prime minister may not be held by a citizen of Georgia who is simultaneously the citizen of another country.

<text>Vellore ( ), also spelled Velur, is a sprawling city and the administrative headquarters of Vellore district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located on the banks of the Palar River in the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu and is separated into four zones that are further subdivided into 60 wards, covering an area of 153.14  km2 and housing a population of 315128 as reported by the 2011 census. The Vellore city along with its sub urban areas is spread across approximately 200  km² with a population of 484,690 as of 2011. It is located about west of Chennai, and about east of Bangalore. Vellore is located on the Mumbai–Chennai arm of the Golden Quadrilateral. Vellore is governed under a mayor and the Vellore Municipal Corporation. It is a part of both the Lok Sabha and state assembly constituencies of Vellore.

Vellore is the home to the Christian Medical College &amp; Hospital, the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), the Sripuram Golden Temple, and the Shenbakkam Raghavendra Swamy Mutt.

The Vellore region is the largest exporter of finished leather goods in the country. Leather exports from Vellore account for more than 37% of India&#x27;s leather exports and leather-related products.

Vellore is one of 27 cities chosen by the Government of India to take part in the country&#x27;s Smart Cities Mission.

Oxford Economics Global Cities Index 2024 ranked Vellore as 24th Best City in India and 729th best city in the world 

==Etymology==
According to a legend, many babul trees (known locally as velan trees) surrounded this region, which led to the name &#x27;Vellore&#x27;.

Vellore is also known as the Second Madras because of its importance and location relative to Chennai (Madras).

==History==
The recorded history of Vellore dates back to the ninth century, as seen from a Chola inscription in the Annamalaiyar Temple in Tiruvannamalai.

Vellore is strategically located and well-connected by rail and bus routes to major towns in the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Many dynasties and rulers dominated Vellore throughout its history, including the Pallava dynasty, Medieval Cholas, Later Cholas, the Rashtrakuta dynasty, the Sambuvaraya chieftains, Vijayanagar, the Nawabs of the Carnatic, and the administration of the British. In the 18th century, Vellore was involved in the Carnatic Wars between Britain and France. It was situated close to several decisive battles, including those at Ambur (1749), Arcot (1751), and Vandavasi (1760). During the first half of the 19th century, the town came under British rule.

Vellore Fort is important to Vellore&#x27;s history. Due to a lack of historical records, it is not known exactly when the fort was constructed, but estimates based on stone inscriptions suggests that the fort was most likely built during the rule of Chinna Bommi Nayak between 1526 and 1595. The fort is a good example of Tamil Nadu military architecture, while the Jalakandeswarar Temple within the fort represents Vijayanagara architecture.

Christian Medical College &amp; Hospital, founded in 1900 by the American medical missionary Dr. Ida S. Scudder, is another Vellore landmark. The hospital has grown into a medical institution of international repute.

The central prison in Vellore, established in 1830, had imprisoned notable Indian independence activists like C. Rajagopalachari and Ramaswamy Venkataraman. Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of National Highway 48 between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of Tipu Sultan were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of Palar River built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy in Sri Lanka, who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.

===Vellore Fort===
The fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali&#x27;s siege from 1780 to 1782, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis’ march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.

When Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu&#x27;s surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the mutiny of 1806.

===Vellore mutiny===
In 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army of the British East India Company, General Sir John Cradock, began an ambitious reform of the army&#x27;s disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how sepoys should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather cockade. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity.

In May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to Fort St. George in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased Tipu Sultan exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan&#x27;s daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the Kingdom of Mysore, they declared Tipu Sultan&#x27;s son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers inflicted about 200 casualties before their revolt was put down by reinforcements under the command of Sir Hugh Robert Rollo Gillespie; many of the mutineers were captured and summarily executed or court-martialed.

As a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger Sepoy Mutiny in 1857.

In the 1930s, a series of communal riots occurred between Hindus and Muslims.

==Economic, social and cultural changes in the 20th century==
The economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited in Ranipet and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Explosives Limited, and the locality of Katpadi were established as the result of government policy. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which has generated employment opportunities and benefitted farmers. Uzhavar Santhai is a useful market window for farmers. Women-driven self help groups have played an important role in building the rural economy and teaching rural women to be self-reliant. Vellore has also seen a period of upward social growth with improvement in literacy and the local economy. Literacy improved in part due to the Arivoli Movement.

<doc id="563917" wikidata="Q1066683" url="?curid=563917" title="Charleston Battery">
<text>The Charleston Battery are an American professional soccer club based in Charleston, South Carolina, and member of the USL Championship. Founded in 1993, the Battery are the oldest continuously operating professional soccer club in the United States.

Charleston are one of the more successful lower-division soccer clubs in the United States, having won four league titles. The Battery won the USISL Pro League in 1996, the USL A-League in 2003, the USL Second Division in 2010 (where they also won the regular season title), and the USL Championship in 2012. They were also crowned the USL Championship Eastern Conference champions and league finalists in 2023. Charleston are also the most successful club in the history of the supporter-led Southern Derby competition with 10 first-place finishes.

The Battery have become renowned for their impressive list of alumni to play at the next level, domestically and abroad. These players who were developed at Charleston include Fidel Barajas, Ozzie Alonso, Lamar Neagle, Maikel Chang, Dante Polvara, Trey Muse and Brian Anunga, among others.

Charleston Battery currently play at Patriots Point Soccer Complex in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Previously, the club played its home games at the soccer-specific MUSC Health Stadium in the Daniel Island section of Charleston from 1999 to 2019. The team&#x27;s colors are black and yellow, with a traditional red scheme for away uniforms. From 2004 through the 2021 season, their head coach and general manager was Mike Anhaeuser.

==History==
Charleston Battery was formed in 1993 by an ownership group of local soccer enthusiasts led by Tony Bakker, a native of London who had relocated his software company Blackbaud to the Charleston area in 1989. The club hired experienced college coach and University of South Carolina graduate Tim Hankinson to develop the team, and Battery started as a member of the USISL, which eventually evolved and came to be known as the USL in 1995. The Battery won their first league championship in 1996 under Portuguese manager Nuno Piteira, defeating the Charlotte Eagles 3–2 in the final. In 1997 Charleston became one of the original clubs of the newly branded A-League (later the USL First Division).

In 1999 Charleston Battery moved into what is now known as MUSC Health Stadium, becoming the first non-Major League Soccer professional club in the United States to build its own stadium, and forged a reputation as one of the country&#x27;s most well-established lower division clubs. The Battery hired veteran English coach Alan Dicks and signed many experienced domestic players such as Paul Conway, Dan Calichman and Eric Wynalda while also bringing in notable foreign signings such as Terry Phelan and Raúl Díaz Arce. In 2001 Dicks was replaced by fellow Englishman Chris Ramsey, who led Charleston to the A-League championship in 2003 with a 3–0 victory in the final over Minnesota Thunder in Charleston. Following Ramsey&#x27;s departure in 2004, the club promoted longtime player and assistant coach Mike Anhaeuser to be the club&#x27;s new coach.

In 2008 Charleston Battery reached the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup final for the first time, playing against Major League Soccer team D.C. United at RFK Stadium. In the final the Battery conceded an early goal but bounced back with a quick-fire equalizer through an Ian Fuller goal, assisted by Chris Williams. Later in the half Lazo Alavanja hit the post but at half time the scores were tied at 1–1. At the start of the second half Charleston conceded early again, but in the final seconds of extra time Marco Reda put the ball in the back of the net for Charleston, only to have his goal controversially disallowed as offside. D.C. United would go on to win the match 2–1.

In 2010 Charleston was invited by several other USL clubs to join the breakaway league eventually known as the North American Soccer League, but Battery chose to remain in the USL system and self-relegate to the USL Second Division, which eventually became the chief USL professional division. In their first third division season in 2010, Charleston led the league standings for the entire year and went undefeated at home. Charleston defeated the Richmond Kickers 2–1 in the final to claim the club&#x27;s third league championship. Lamar Neagle was named the USL-2 league MVP and lead the league in scoring with 13 league goals. Anhaeuser was named the league&#x27;s coach of the year, his second time receiving the honor. In 2012 Charleston Battery won their fourth league title in club history, defeating local rivals Wilmington Hammerheads 1–0 in the final. Micheal Azira scored a 74th-minute winner after Jose Cuevas slipped a pass to him on the left side of the penalty area.

In recent years Charleston Battery have had loan affiliations with several Major League Soccer clubs, beginning with a one-year deal to become the USL Pro affiliate of Vancouver Whitecaps FC in 2014. For the 2015 season, Battery signed a one-year deal to affiliate with the Houston Dynamo. On January 15, 2016, it was announced that the club would be partnering with the Atlanta United FC for the 2016 MLS season prior to Atlanta&#x27;s entry to MLS in 2017.

In February 2016, it was announced that longtime majority owner Tony Bakker had sold the club to B Sports Entertainment, an investment group led by local tech executives. Club president Andrew Bell and coach Mike Anhaeuser remained in charge of team operations after the ownership transition. In early 2018 it was announced that Bell would be leaving the club to take over operations of an announced USL expansion club in Memphis, Tennessee, ending a two-decade career in the Charleston front office. Bell was replaced by club operations officer Mike Kelleher.

In October 2019, it was announced that B Sports Entertainment had sold the club to Rob Salvatore of HCFC, LLC with a move to Patriots Point Soccer Complex in Mount Pleasant.

At the conclusion of the 2021 season, the Battery announced on November 1, 2021, that the club and Mike Anhaeuser had parted ways. Anhaeuser joined the Charleston Battery as a player in 1994, and switched into a coaching role in 1999. In 2004, he was named head coach of the club and led Charleston Battery to a U.S. Open Cup Final appearance in 2008 as well as two USL Championships in 2010 and 2012.

On December 20, 2021, Battery announced that they had hired Conor Casey as head coach. However, on October 12, 2022, with one match remaining in the season and the Battery near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, the club and Casey opted to part ways by mutual agreement. Assistant coach Dennis Sanchez was named interim head coach while a search for a permanent replacement began.

On November 17, 2022, Battery announced that they had hired Memphis 901 FC head coach Ben Pirmann for the same position in Charleston. Pirmann was named the 2022 USL Championship Coach of the Year after leading Memphis to a 2nd-place finish in the Eastern Conference and a spot in the conference semifinals.

In 2023, the Battery bounced back with the best turnaround campaign in USL Championship history, amassing a 17-9-8 record in the regular season to finish third in the conference, a 34-point improvement from 2022. Charleston won a league-best 29 points away from home and tied for the most road wins (eight), along with winning 16 points from losing positions (sixth-most in the league). The Battery advanced to the 2023 USL Championship Final after defeating Indy, Birmingham and Louisville in the earlier rounds to claim the Eastern Conference title, the club&#x27;s first trophy since 2012. Charleston were narrow runners-up in the Final to Phoenix Rising FC at home. The season was highlighted by the break-out campaigns of Fidel Barajas, Nick Markanich, Derek Dodson, Dante Polvara and Trey Muse, and Augustine Williams was the top scorer for a second consecutive year. Barajas matched the single-season assists record with 11, became the club&#x27;s youngest all-time goalscorer, and was named the USL Championship Young Player of the Year and All-League Second Team. Pirmann was named a finalist for Coach of the Year.

Barajas and Muse were sold to MLS sides Real Salt Lake and Portland Timbers, respectively, in the following offseason prior to the 2024 campaign.

==Colors and badge==

Charleston&#x27;s traditional colors are yellow, black and red. In Charleston Battery&#x27;s first few seasons, the home kit was typically black and white with a red accent. Beginning in 1997 the club began using black with yellow stripes, which has remained in use as the home jersey ever since. The Charleston away kit has typically been a combination of red, white and black, though for the 2017 season the away kit is either the 25 Anniversary black and silver combination, or white and black.

The club badge remained the same iconic logo from 1993 through the 2019 season, other than minor adjustments in color, resolution and the addition of four stars representing each of the team&#x27;s league championships. It is a classic shield in the club&#x27;s signature yellow and black stripes, featuring a pair of crossed artillery cannons (alluding to the city&#x27;s naval history and current presence) above a depiction of a football ball.

In December 2019, the club unveiled the new branding for 2020 and moving forward. Matthew Wolff, who has designed a number of logos for soccer clubs around the world, was instrumental in working with Battery ownership to create a modern representation of Charleston&#x27;s crest. The new logo featured crossed cannons on a black circle, with the iconic crescent shape, with Charleston emblazoned across the top and 1993, the year the club was established at the bottom.

==Stadiums==
*Stoney Field; Charleston, South Carolina (1993–1998)
*MUSC Health Stadium (formerly Blackbaud Stadium); Daniel Island, Charleston, South Carolina (1999–2019)
*Patriots Point Soccer Complex; Mount Pleasant, South Carolina (from 2020)

Charleston Battery played their first six seasons in downtown Charleston at Stoney Field, a facility they shared with various college and high school sports teams.

The club moved to MUSC Health Stadium (previously known as Blackbaud Stadium) in the suburban Daniel Island area in 1999. The first privately funded soccer-specific stadium built in the United States, it seats 5,100 people. MUSC Health Stadium is modeled on lower level English soccer stadiums and features an on-site pub called The Three Lions behind the west stand. The stadium site also features a training field and club offices.

In 2016, the ownership built the second-largest video board in the Southeast. MUSC Health Stadium&#x27;s jumbotron is 3,000 square feet. When comparing the square footage to stadium seats ratio, the video board is the largest in the world.

Additionally, the complex includes sky boxes, a plaza for corporate entertaining, and state-of-the-art media capabilities, making it one of the premier professional soccer venues in the U.S.

In 2019, under new ownership led by Rob Salvatore, the club announced that Charleston Battery would move off Daniel Island to Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. The current stadium complex is home to the College of Charleston soccer, baseball and softball teams. Situated off the Ravenel Bridge in Mt. Pleasant, Battery&#x27;s new stadium is back in the heart of Charleston. Patriots Point sits a short drive from all corners of the Holy City and minutes from the best bars, restaurants and attractions the city has to offer.

After extensive renovations and expansion in early 2020, Patriots Point opened to limited fans during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. The stadium held its grand opening during the 2021 season as fans &#x27;packed the Point&#x27; to cheer on the Black and Yellow. The ownership group has continued to expand developments at Patriots Point, with the introduction of premium seating options via shipping containers transformed into suite-like boxes with multiple levels. The stadium currently holds three &quot;suite boxes&quot; that fans can rent out for matches.

==Club culture==
The independent supporters&#x27; group is &quot;The Regiment&quot;, who stand in Supporters Section directly behind the north goal of the stadium, along with other supporters&#x27; groups including the American Outlaws-affiliated &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and the Spanish-speaking &quot;Charleston Barra Brava&quot;.

Charleston Battery competes for the Coffee Pot Cup every time it faces their rival team D.C. United of Major League Soccer, a trophy established by the two sides&#x27; supporters and currently held by DC. The clubs have regularly faced each other in friendlies and cup competitions, with the 2008 US Open Cup final remaining the highest profile match between the two clubs to date. Charleston are also longtime league rivals of the Richmond Kickers.

The supporters&#x27; groups compete with supporters of the Charlotte Independence, Jacks Militia in the Southern Derby Cup, which Charleston Battery had won a record nine times.

The supporters&#x27; groups compete with supporters of the Tampa Bay Rowdies, Ralph&#x27;s Mob and the Skyway Casuals, in the No Quarter Derby.

Halfway through the 2021 season, the club introduced a cannon in the stadium to fire off after each Battery goal and at the start and end of matches.

Gray Television holds local media rights with an arrangement similar to USL club Phoenix Rising FC, which has rights with the various Arizona&#x27;s Family Sports. WCSC 5.3 is the flagship station with games airing in the Columbia market on Gray station WIS 10.4.

<text>In group theory, a branch of mathematics, the baby-step giant-step is a meet-in-the-middle algorithm for computing the discrete logarithm or order of an element in a finite abelian group by Daniel Shanks. The discrete log problem is of fundamental importance to the area of public key cryptography.

Many of the most commonly used cryptography systems are based on the assumption that the discrete log is extremely difficult to compute; the more difficult it is, the more security it provides a data transfer. One way to increase the difficulty of the discrete log problem is to base the cryptosystem on a larger group.

==Theory==
The algorithm is based on a space–time tradeoff. It is a fairly simple modification of trial multiplication, the naive method of finding discrete logarithms.

Given a cyclic group formula_1 of order formula_2, a generator formula_3 of the group and a group element formula_4, the problem is to find an integer formula_5 such that
: formula_6

The baby-step giant-step algorithm is based on rewriting formula_5:
:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10
:formula_11
Therefore, we have:
: formula_12
: formula_13
: formula_14
The algorithm precomputes formula_15 for several values of formula_16. Then it fixes an formula_17 and tries values of formula_18 in the right-hand side of the congruence above, in the manner of trial multiplication. It tests to see if the congruence is satisfied for any value of formula_16, using the precomputed values of formula_15.

==The algorithm==
Input: A cyclic group &quot;G&quot; of order &quot;n&quot;, having a generator &quot;α&quot; and an element &quot;β&quot;.

Output: A value &quot;x&quot; satisfying formula_21.

# &quot;m&quot; ← Ceiling()
# For all &quot;j&quot; where 0 ≤ &quot;j&quot; &lt; &quot;m&quot;:
## Compute &quot;α&quot;&quot;j&quot; and store the pair (&quot;j&quot;, &quot;α&quot;&quot;j&quot;) in a table. (See )
# Compute &quot;α&quot;−&quot;m&quot;.
# &quot;γ&quot; ← &quot;β&quot;. (set &quot;γ&quot; = &quot;β&quot;)
# For all &quot;i&quot; where 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;m&quot;:
## Check to see if γ is the second component (&quot;α&quot;&quot;j&quot;) of any pair in the table.
## If so, return &quot;im&quot; + &quot;j&quot;.
## If not, &quot;γ&quot; ← &quot;γ&quot; • &quot;α&quot;−&quot;m&quot;.

==In practice==
The best way to speed up the baby-step giant-step algorithm is to use an efficient table lookup scheme. The best in this case is a hash table. The hashing is done on the second component, and to perform the check in step 1 of the main loop, γ is hashed and the resulting memory address checked. Since hash tables can retrieve and add elements in formula_22 time (constant time), this does not slow down the overall baby-step giant-step algorithm.

The space complexity of the algorithm is formula_23, while the time complexity of the algorithm is formula_24. This running time is better than the formula_25 running time of the naive brute force calculation.

The baby-step giant-step algorithm could be used by an eavesdropper to derive the private key generated in the Diffie Hellman key exchange, when the modulus is a prime number that is not too large. If the modulus is not prime, the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm has a smaller algorithmic complexity, and potentially solves the same problem.

== Notes ==
* The baby-step giant-step algorithm is a generic algorithm. It works for every finite cyclic group.
* It is not necessary to know the exact order of the group &quot;G&quot; in advance. The algorithm still works if &quot;n&quot; is merely an upper bound on the group order.
* Usually the baby-step giant-step algorithm is used for groups whose order is prime. If the order of the group is composite then the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm is more efficient.
* The algorithm requires O(&quot;m&quot;) memory. It is possible to use less memory by choosing a smaller &quot;m&quot; in the first step of the algorithm. Doing so increases the running time, which then is O(&quot;n&quot;/&quot;m&quot;). Alternatively one can use Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm for logarithms, which has about the same running time as the baby-step giant-step algorithm, but only a small memory requirement.
* While this algorithm is credited to Daniel Shanks, who published the 1971 paper in which it first appears, a 1994 paper by Nechaev states that it was known to Gelfond in 1962.
* There exist optimized versions of the original algorithm, such as using the collision-free truncated lookup tables of or negation maps and Montgomery&#x27;s simultaneous modular inversion as proposed in.

<doc id="563932" wikidata="Q1061666" url="?curid=563932" title="Shocked quartz">
<text>Shocked quartz is a form of quartz that has a microscopic structure that is different from normal quartz. Under intense pressure (but limited temperature), the crystalline structure of quartz is deformed along planes inside the crystal. These planes, which show up as lines under a microscope, are called planar deformation features (PDFs), or shock lamellae.

==Discovery==
Shocked quartz was discovered following underground nuclear weapons testing, which generated the intense pressures required to alter the quartz lattice. Eugene Shoemaker showed that shocked quartz is also found inside craters created by meteor impact, such as the Barringer Crater and Chicxulub crater. The presence of shocked quartz supports that such craters were formed by impact, because a volcanic eruption would not generate the required pressure.

Lightning is now known to contribute to the surface record of shocked quartz grains, complicating identification of hypervelocity impact features.

==Formation==

Shocked quartz is usually associated in nature with two high-pressure polymorphs of silicon dioxide: coesite and stishovite. These polymorphs have a crystal structure different from standard quartz. This structure can be formed only by intense pressure (more than 2 gigapascals), but at moderate temperatures. Coesite and stishovite are usually viewed as indicative of impact events or eclogite facies metamorphism (or nuclear explosion), but are also found in sediments prone to lightning strikes and in fulgurites.

==Occurrence==
Shocked quartz is found worldwide, and occurs in the thin Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary layer, which occurs at the contact between Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks. This is further evidence (in addition to iridium enrichment) that the transition between the two geologic periods was caused by a large impact.

Lightning also generates planar deformation features in quartz and is capable of propagating appropriate pressure/temperature gradients in rocks and sediments alike. This very common mechanism may significantly contribute to the accumulation of shocked quartz in the geologic record. Mantle xenoliths and sediments derived from them may contain coesite or stishovite.

Though shocked quartz is only recently recognized, Eugene Shoemaker discovered it prior to its crystallographic description in building stones in the Bavarian town of Nördlingen, derived from shock-metamorphic rocks, such as breccia and pseudotachylite, of Ries crater.

<text>State University of New York Maritime College (SUNY Maritime College) is a public maritime college in the Bronx, New York City. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Founded in 1874, the SUNY Maritime College was the first college of its kind (federally approved, offering commercial nautical instruction) to be founded in the United States and is one of only seven degree-granting maritime academies in the United States.

== History ==
Maritime College is the oldest institution of its kind in the United States. Due in part to the Civil War, there was a decline in the American maritime industry and a growing concern about the professionalism of its officers. As a result, the New York Chamber of Commerce and maritime interests of the port of New York lobbied the state legislature to create a professional nautical school for the city. This was done in 1873, but the school lacked a ship. The chamber then teamed up with the noted naval education reformer and modernizer, Stephen B. Luce. Luce led the effort, and through his efforts an act was passed by Congress in 1874 that enabled individual states to request from the Navy retired or obsolete vessels to train seamen. The state of New York then appealed to the Navy for a training vessel. On December 14, 1874, the USS &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; arrived in New York harbor and became the first home of the New York Nautical School, the college&#x27;s initial name. Originally administered by the Board of Education of the City of New York, it was conducted as a grammar school that taught common school subjects (along with nautical classes) during the winter term, and then held practical cruises during the summer term. As time advanced, the school began to teach more advanced professional subjects. During this early period, the school was typically run on an annual appropriation of $20,000 to $30,000 with the school often facing closure because the cost per pupil was much higher than in a regular public school, mainly due to the overhead of ship maintenance and student board.
By 1907, the &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; was replaced by the gunboat &quot;Newport&quot;, a sail-steam hybrid.

In 1913, New York City threatened to close the school due to its costs. However, the state of New York took over its management and renamed it the New York State Nautical School. Despite being a state institution, the school was almost closed in 1916, again for budgetary reasons, but efforts from the maritime industry and the school&#x27;s alumni kept it alive. After this time, the American merchant marine grew and subsequently a greater demand for trained American merchant marine brought growth to the school.

During this period, the school was administered by a Board of Governors in addition to the Superintendent. In 1921, the school, which had for long moved from berth to berth, found itself at Bedloe&#x27;s Island (now Liberty Island) in New York Harbor. There they were allowed to use the army facilities. Over time, conditions on the island were deemed inadequate to teach modern merchant mariners.

With the growing demand, a push was made by then superintendent James Harvey Tomb beginning in 1927 to acquire a larger ship and a land-based institution. The ship came in the form of the &quot;Procyon&quot;, which was renamed the &quot;Empire State&quot;. This ship effectively doubled the size of the school. 

The school, renamed the New York State Merchant Marine Academy in 1929, finally became land-based in 1938 at the Maritime College&#x27;s present Throggs Neck campus in Fort Schuyler. One of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s last acts as Governor of New York State was to sign the act turning Fort Schuyler and the Throggs Neck peninsula over to the school for use as a shore-based facility of higher education. Work restoring Fort Schuyler for the academy&#x27;s use was done at first by the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) in 1934 followed by the Works Progress Administration in 1935. The fort was restored, allowing the school to operate there by 1938. A third name change took place in 1941, when the school became the New York State Maritime Academy.

In 1946, degree conferring status was granted and the academy became a college. Two years later, the college was one of the original institutions incorporated into the State University of New York system. In 1949, just one year later, the newly-minted university took on its current name, the State University of New York Maritime College.

== Academics ==
All of the college&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s degree programs may be combined with preparation for the professional license as a United States Merchant Marine Officer. The college also offers a master&#x27;s degree in International Transportation Management and Maritime and Naval Studies; as well as several graduate Professional Mariner Training certificates. Most of the degree programs may be completed while concurrently preparing for the United States Merchant Marine officer&#x27;s license as a third mate or third assistant engineer. Additionally, SUNY Maritime College has the only United States Navy/United States Marine Corps Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) program in the metropolitan New York City area, which prepares enrollees for commissioned officer positions in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. , the graduates of SUNY Maritime College earned US$144,000, the highest average annual salary of any university graduates in the United States.

==Athletics==

The Maritime Privateers compete in 16 NCAA Division III varsity sports (8 men&#x27;s, 6 women&#x27;s, 2 co-ed).

== Regiment ==
SUNY Maritime College has a regiment to fulfill the USCG requirements for obtaining a license through a college. The regiment has a Pipe and Drum Band, Regimental Band, Honor Guard (Color Guard and Drill Team), and a Security Company. The band and honor guard perform at events both on and off campus, such as parades and dinners.

Incoming Cadets must go through Indoctrination (shortened to INDOC), ten days of training in August where they learn leadership and basic seamanship skills. During freshman year, also known as Mariner Under Guidance (MUG) year, cadets are made to square corners, stand at attention for all upperclassmen, have room inspections, and maintain the uniform of the day.

<doc id="563950" wikidata="Q424335" url="?curid=563950" title="Coesite">
<text>Coesite () is a form (polymorph) of silicon dioxide (SiO2) that is formed when very high pressure (2–3 gigapascals), and moderately high temperature (), are applied to quartz. Coesite was first synthesized by Loring Coes, Jr., a chemist at the Norton Company, in 1953.

==Occurrences==

In 1960, a natural occurrence of coesite was reported by Edward C. T. Chao, in collaboration with Eugene Shoemaker, from Barringer Crater, in Arizona, US, which was evidence that the crater must have been formed by an impact. After this report, the presence of coesite in unmetamorphosed rocks was taken as evidence of a meteorite impact event or of an atomic bomb explosion. It was not expected that coesite would survive in high pressure metamorphic rocks.

In metamorphic rocks, coesite was initially described in eclogite xenoliths from the mantle of the Earth that were carried up by ascending magmas; kimberlite is the most common host of such xenoliths. In metamorphic rocks, coesite is now recognized as one of the best mineral indicators of metamorphism at very high pressures (UHP, or ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism). Such UHP metamorphic rocks record subduction or continental collisions in which crustal rocks are carried to depths of or more. Coesite is formed at pressures above about 2.5 GPa (25 kbar) and temperature above about 700 °C. This corresponds to a depth of about 70 km in the Earth. It can be preserved as mineral inclusions in other phases because as it partially reverts to quartz, the quartz rim exerts pressure on the core of the grain, preserving the metastable grain as tectonic forces uplift and expose these rock at the surface. As a result, the grains have a characteristic texture of a polycrystalline quartz rim (see infobox figure).

Coesite has been identified in UHP metamorphic rocks around the world, including the western Alps of Italy at Dora Maira, the Ore Mountains of Germany, the Lanterman Range of Antarctica, in the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, in the Western Gneiss region of Norway, the Dabie-Shan Range in Eastern China, the Himalayas of Eastern Pakistan, and in the Appalachian Mountains of Vermont.

==Crystal structure==
Coesite is a tectosilicate with each silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedron. Each oxygen atom is then bonded to two Si atoms to form a framework. There are two crystallographically distinct Si atoms and five different oxygen positions in the unit cell. Although the unit cell is close to being hexagonal in shape (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are nearly equal and β nearly 120°), it is inherently monoclinic and cannot be hexagonal. The crystal structure of coesite is similar to that of feldspar and consists of four silicon dioxide tetrahedra arranged in Si4O8 and Si8O16 rings. The rings are further arranged into chains. This structure is metastable within the stability field of quartz: coesite will eventually decay back into quartz with a consequent volume increase, although the metamorphic reaction is very slow at the low temperatures of the Earth&#x27;s surface. The crystal symmetry is monoclinic C2/c, No.15, Pearson symbol mS48.

<doc id="563954" wikidata="Q269316" url="?curid=563954" title="The Republicans (Germany)">
<text>The Republicans (, REP) is a national-conservative political party in Germany. The primary plank of the programme is opposition to immigration. The party tends to attract protest voters who think that the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) are not sufficiently conservative. It was founded in 1983 by former CSU members Franz Handlos and Ekkehard Voigt, and Franz Schönhuber was the party&#x27;s leader from 1985 to 1994. The party had later been led by Rolf Schlierer, until 2014. The Republicans had seats in the European Parliament between 1989 and 1994, Abgeordnetenhaus of West Berlin in 1989–1990 and in the parliament of the German state of Baden-Württemberg between 1991 and 2001.

The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution between 1992 and 2006 said that the Republicans were a &quot;party with partially extreme-right tendencies&quot; although the Republican leadership did rebuff an electoral alliance with more openly extreme-right parties such as the National Democratic Party of Germany, losing members to these more successful parties. The Republicans&#x27; strongholds tended to be in relatively affluent South Germany rather than the more economically depressed Eastern Germany where the more radical right-wing parties tended to do well.

In the 2013 federal elections, the Republicans received only 0.2 percent of the total national vote.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The CDU/CSU parties witnessed increasing dissatisfaction of their right wing in the 1980s, while at the same time the extreme-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) was in decline. The CDU/CSU policies of European integration and acceptance of the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; led to much criticism initially. Finally, in 1983, in complete breach of the party&#x27;s long-term opposition to measures that could stabilize the economy of East Germany (GDR), CSU leader Franz Josef Strauss supported a credit of more than ten billion &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; to the country. This led several members of the CSU to leave the party, including Members of Parliament Franz Handlos and Ekkehard Voigt.

===Formation and Handlos leadership===
The Republicans was formed in a Bavarian tavern on 17 November 1983 by CSU defectors and MPs Franz Handlos and Ekkehard Voigt, and former radio journalist and television talk show host Franz Schönhuber, with a past in the NSDAP and Waffen-SS. Handlos was chosen as the party&#x27;s first leader, while Voigt and Schönhuber became his deputies. The party was initially considered both by itself and by the media as a &quot;Rechtsabspaltung&quot; (right-wing splinter) of the CSU. In its early years, the party was able to profit from dissatisfaction with the CSU due to its alleged abuse of power, patronage and limited internal democracy.

Similar to what CSU-leader Strauss had long threatened the sister party CDU with, Handlos wanted to make the Republicans into a &quot;bundesweite&quot; (federal) right-wing conservative party that would contest elections in the whole of (West) Germany. Schönhuber in turn wanted a more right-wing populist party inspired by the successes of the French National Front. This led to a fierce power struggle, in which Handlos accused Schönhuber of seeking to put the party on a course towards right-wing extremism. Failing in his attempt to expel Schönhuber, Handlos instead resigned from the party, followed by Voigt a year later. Schönhuber was subsequently elected chairperson of the party in June 1985, with former NPD member Harald Neubauer as his party secretary. This strengthened media allegations that the party was right-wing extremist rather than right-wing conservative.

===Schönhuber leadership (1985–1994)===

The party&#x27;s first election, the 1986 Bavarian state election, gave the party financial campaign support, which it used to strengthen its organisation; by 1987 it had chapters in all but one West German state. In the election, it nevertheless failed to beat the 5% threshold with its 3.1% support. Outside Bavaria, the party gained less support, and ended up behind both main extreme-right parties, the NPD and the German People&#x27;s Union (DVU). The Republicans chose not to contest the 1987 federal election as it considered itself too weak, and CSU leader Strauss adopted some of Schönhuber&#x27;s rhetoric to win back voters. When prospects of German unification became more realistic, the Republicans started to see political success, and the year 1989 marked the party&#x27;s electoral breakthrough. The party won 7.8% of the vote in the January 1989 election in West Berlin, giving it eleven local seats. In the European Parliament election in June later the same year, it won 7.1% of the vote and six seats. Its strongest showing was in Bavaria, where it won 14.6% of the vote.

From the start to the end of 1989, the membership of the Republicans increased from 8,500 to 25,000. At the same time, hundreds of editorials, articles and books were written about the party, including some that speculated that it could become the fifth party of the German party system. The party gained some support among the right-wing of the CDU/CSU, and was even considered by some as a possible future coalition partner. Although some experts argued that the Republicans still was a democratic right-wing party, the majority considered that the party was part of the extreme-right.

The Republicans lost its electoral gains in the 1990s as it was torn by internal strife, scandals, and failure to attract voters in former East Germany after the reunification. It contested fourteen elections between 1990 and 1991, but never surpassed the 5% threshold (although it came close in the Bavarian state election with 4.9% of the vote). Internal strife led the leadership of two state branches of the party to be collectively discharged in 1989, and in 1990, open conflict erupted between the &#x27;moderate&#x27; Schönhuber and &#x27;extremist&#x27; Neubauer. Schönhuber briefly resigned as party leader, until he was reinstated two months later by a majority of the party delegates. After this, the extremists, including Neubauer, were purged from the party leadership, and Neubauer was replaced by the moderate, national-conservative Rolf Schlierer.

Although the party seemed poised to disappear in the beginning of the 1990s, it won a surprising result in the April 1992 state election in Baden-Württemberg. In the election, in which the party was headed by Schlierer, the Republicans won 10.9% of the vote and fifteen seats, and became the third largest party in the state. The party still failed to breach the 5% threshold in subsequent elections, although it won as much as 4.8% in the 1993 Hamburg state council election. Lack of further electoral successes resulted in new strife between the party&#x27;s moderates and radicals, and in December 1992, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution decided to start surveillance of the party, categorizing it as a &quot;party with partially extreme-right tendencies&quot;. Disgruntled by the poor showings in the 1994 &quot;super election year&quot;, Schönhuber to much surprise agreed to establish cooperations with the DVU, a party that had always been denounced as &quot;extreme-right&quot; by the Republicans. The Republican leadership in turn hastily convened and dismissed Schönhuber as party leader, replacing him with Schlierer.

===Schlierer leadership (1994–2014)===

The mid-1990s was marked by open conflict between the Schönhuber and Schlierer factions. While Schönhuber sought a &quot;united right-wing&quot; model for the party, Schlierer wanted clear distance to &quot;extremists&quot;. Schönhuber resigned from the party altogether in 1995, and the party subsequently contested a series of unsuccessful state elections. The litmus test for Schlierer&#x27;s leadership occurred in the state election in Baden-Württemberg in March 1996, for which he had stated many times that he would resign as party leader if the party failed to get reelected to the state parliament. Schlierer eventually succeeded in his goal, against most expectations, as the Republicans won 9.1% of the vote and fourteen seats. In the following years, election results for the party again dropped, and in the 1999 European Parliament election it won just 1.7% of the vote.

The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution stopped monitoring the party in 2006, something they had been doing since 1992. The Republican leadership rebuffed the offer of an electoral alliance with two more successful parties that were later to merge, the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and the German People&#x27;s Union (DVU), due to their openly extreme-right positions. For years and especially under Schlierer&#x27;s leadership, the party has lost far-right members to the DVU and NPD. The strongholds for the Republicans also differ from those of the more radical right-wing parties, with the former being strongest in the relatively affluent South Germany whilst the latter have had most success in the more economically depressed Eastern Germany.

In the 2009 federal elections, the Republicans received 0.4 percent of the total national vote. Its strongest showing was in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg, in which it received 1.1 percent of the vote. In the 2013 federal elections, the Republicans received 0.2 percent of the total national vote.

===Since 2014===
The Republicans has lost support to Alternative for Germany (AfD) from 2014 onwards, with former Republican leader Rolf Schlierer leaving the Republicans, expressing support for the AfD and stating the AfD had largely adopted the same program as the Republicans.

In 2018, several members of the AfD in Saarland switched to the Republicans due to concerns that the AfD was shifting too far to the right.

==Ideology==

Initially, the Republicans was a conservative party close to the CSU, with a moderate nationalist approach. When Schönhuber became leader of the party, it radicalised and became increasingly nationalist. His positions included abolishing trade unions, reducing the welfare state, expelling all foreigners and returning to Germany&#x27;s 1937 borders. The latter included campaigning for the unification of the then-existing West and East Germany, which helped boost the party&#x27;s popularity in the late 1980s. The party also attacked the European Union as an infringement of German sovereignty following the enactment of the Maastricht Treaty. The ideology of the Republicans is mainly characterised by nationalism, although the party itself rejects such a label, instead regarding itself as &quot;national&quot; or &quot;patriotic&quot;.

===German nationalism===
From its outset, the party saw German reunification as its foremost goal. The party welcomed the reunification when it occurred in 1990, but considered it to only be a &quot;small reunification&quot; of West Germany and &quot;Central Germany&quot;, as the party considered the real East Germany to be the &quot;Ostgebiete&quot;, namely the former German territories in Poland and Russia. The party saw the 1990 reunification only as a first step towards &quot;full reunification&quot;, which would be the return to Germany&#x27;s 1937 borders. It sought to accomplish a &quot;peaceful completion of German unity&quot; through negotiations and treaties with these states. The party did not however strive for the inclusion of all groups it considered as part of the German ethnic community, such as Austrians, South Tyroleans and Transylvanian Saxons.

===Economy===
The economic policies of the Republicans are largely derived from those of the CSU, and its social market economy. The party additionally wants to reduce the size of bureaucracy and state subsidies. The early programmes of the party sought to protect German agriculture, the middle classes, as well as German small businesses from big corporations and monopolisation. From the 1990s, the party increasingly started to promote the interests of the lower classes. While it maintained a neo-liberal discourse and calls for budget cuts, it began promoting welfare chauvinism, namely only funding German interests. It also included criticising asylum seekers, immigrants and the European Union for taking away too much German money.

===Immigration===
The Republicans have criticised immigration since its foundation, but the initial relatively moderate discourse became increasingly radical and outspoken under Schönhuber and Neubauer, as well as becoming one of the major topics of party literature. The party highlighted the topic of asylum seekers in the 1980s, when it generally had little importance in German political debate. As the number of asylum seekers increased significantly in the 1990s, so did media attention on a number of controversies, and the major German parties agreed on a stricter asylum law in December 1992. The party welcomed the tightening of the rules, but continued to advocate stricter laws and criticise the still high arrival numbers of what it considered as &quot;sham refugees&quot;. The party criticised Muslims in particular for being fundamentalist and not willing to be integrated, expanding their sub-culture all over Europe.

===Foreign policy===
In its first programme, the Republicans fully supported European integration, with the long-term goal of turning into a federal state. Since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, opposition to the European Union has become one of the party&#x27;s most important issues, and it turned to support a confederal state instead of a federal one. The party perceives the international community to be especially hostile towards Germany, and criticises what it considers to be certain limitations of Germany&#x27;s sovereignty.

=== International relations ===
The Republicans has never been particularly active in establishing relations with other parties internationally. After being elected to the European Parliament in 1989, it briefly teamed up in the European Right group with the French National Front (FN) and the Belgian Vlaams Blok. Together with the Vlaams Blok, the Republicans sought to move the FN away from the Italian Social Movement, which was in conflict with the Republicans over the territorial dispute of South Tyrol. The Republicans&#x27; alliance with these parties however ended already in 1990, when they accepted Neubauer&#x27;s DVU instead of the Republicans in the European Right group. After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the Republicans was also briefly the inspiration for some short-lived initiatives in countries including Hungary, Ukraine, Latvia and Czechoslovakia.

<text>Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini (Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins) is a Roman Catholic church located at Via Vittorio Veneto, 27, just north of the Piazza Barberini, in Rome, Italy. It is the first Roman church dedicated to the Immaculate Conception.

==History==
It was designed by architect Felice Antonio Casoni (1559-1634) and architect Michele da Bergamo (?-1641). Pope Urban VIII blessed its first stone on October 4, 1626, after which his Capuchin brother Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini began constructing it. Its first mass was held on September 8, 1630 and its construction was completed in 1631. It comprises a small nave and 10 side chapels.

==Architecture==

The church is accessed via a scissor staircase, on which the brick facade with white stone pilasters rises. The interior has a single nave with five chapels on each side. Liborio Coccetti painted an &quot;Assumption&quot; on the barrel vault ceiling.

The main altar is built in marble by order of Pope Urban VIII; his coat of arms can be seen at the base of the two columns. The altarpiece, &quot;The Conception&quot; is by Gioacchino Bombelli, from the original by Lanfranco, destroyed by fire.

==Chapels==

The first chapel on the right has a dramatic altarpiece of &quot;St. Michael the Archangel Defeating Satan&quot; (c.1635) by Guido Reni and &quot;Christ Mocked&quot; by Gerard van Honthorst. Two of the most important and noble families of Rome were the rival Barberini and the Pamphilj. In 1630 the Antonio Barberini commissioned from Reni a painting of the Archangel Michael for the Capuchin&#x27;s church. According to a legend, Reni had heard that Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pamphilj had defamed him, or had in some way offended his reputation. The painting, completed in 1636, gave rise to a story that Reni had represented Satan—crushed under St Michael&#x27;s foot—with the facial features of Cardinal Pamphilj in revenge for the slight. 

The second chapel on the right has &quot;The Transfiguration&quot; by Mario Balassi commissioned by Taddeo Barberini, and a &quot;Nativity&quot; (c. 1632) by Giovanni Lanfranco. The right third chapel has &quot;Stigmatization of St. Francis&quot; by Domenichino. The right fourth chapel has &quot;Prayer in Gethsemane&quot; (c. 1632) by Baccio Ciarpi. The right fifth chapel has &quot;Saint Anthony&quot; by Andrea Sacchi.

The left fifth chapel has &quot;Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bonaventure&quot; (1645) by Andrea Sacchi. The left third chapel has &quot;Deposition (La Pieta)&quot; by Andrea Camassei and &quot;Stigmatization of Saint Francis&quot; (c. 1570) by Girolamo Muziano. The left second chapel has &quot;Santa Felice da Cantalice&quot; by Alessandro Turchi. The left first chapel has &quot;Ananias Heals Paul’s Blindness&quot; (c. 1631) by Pietro da Cortona.

==Burials==
* St. Felix of Cantalice, 
* Crispin of Viterbo, 
* Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini
* Aleksander Benedykt Sobieski (sculpted by Camillo Rusconi) are located here.
* Mariano da Torino, (†1972) Capuchin TV presenter

==Crypt==

The crypt is located just under the church. Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who was a member of the Capuchin order, in 1631 ordered the remains of thousands of Capuchin friars exhumed and transferred from the friary Via dei Lucchesi to the crypt.

The underground crypt is divided into five chapels, lit only by dim natural light seeping in through cracks, and small fluorescent lamps. The crypt walls are decorated with the remains in elaborate fashion, making this crypt a macabre work of art. Some of the skeletons are intact and draped with Franciscan habits, but for the most part, individual bones are used to create elaborate ornamental designs.

The crypt originated at a period of a rich and creative cult for their dead; great spiritual masters meditated and preached with a skull in hand. A plaque in one of the chapels reads, in three languages, &quot;What you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.&quot; This is a memento mori.

The popularity of the crypt as a tourist attraction once rivalled the Catacombs. The Sedlec ossuary (1870) in the Czech Republic and the Skull Chapel in Poland are said to have been inspired by it.

Inside the convent there is the Museum of the Capuchin Friars Minor of the Province of Rome : eight rooms that house works of art, volumes, documents, liturgical objects and Capuchin artifacts in common use.

<text>OpenAL (Open Audio Library) is a cross-platform audio application programming interface (API). It is designed for efficient rendering of multichannel three-dimensional positional audio. Its API style and conventions deliberately resemble those of OpenGL. OpenAL is an environmental 3D audio library, which can add realism to a game by simulating attenuation (degradation of sound over distance), the Doppler effect (change in frequency as a result of motion), and material densities.

OpenAL aimed to originally be an open standard and open-source replacement for proprietary (and generally incompatible with one another) 3D audio APIs such as DirectSound and Core Audio, though in practice has largely been implemented on various platforms as a wrapper around said proprietary APIs or as a proprietary and vendor-specific fork. While the reference implementation later became proprietary and unmaintained, there are open source implementations such as OpenAL Soft available.

==History==
OpenAL was originally developed in 2000 by Loki Software to help them in their business of porting Windows games to Linux. After the demise of Loki, the project was maintained for a time by the free software/open source community, and implemented on NVIDIA nForce sound cards and motherboards. It was hosted (and largely developed) by Creative Technology until circa 2012. 

Since 1.1 (2009), the sample implementation by Creative has turned proprietary, with the last releases in free licenses still accessible through the project&#x27;s Subversion source code repository. However, OpenAL Soft is a widely used open source alternative and remains actively maintained and extended.

While the OpenAL charter says that there will be an &quot;Architecture Review Board&quot; (ARB) modeled on the OpenGL ARB, no such organization has ever been formed and the OpenAL specification is generally handled and discussed via email on its public mailing list.

The original mailing list, openal-devel hosted by Creative, ran from March 2003 to circa August 2012. Ryan C. Gordon, a Loki veteran who went on to develop Simple DirectMedia Layer, started a new mailing list and website at OpenAL.org in January 2014. As of February 2023, the list remains in use.

==API structure and functionality==
The general functionality of OpenAL is encoded in &quot;source objects&quot;, &quot;audio buffers&quot; and a single &quot;listener&quot;. A source object contains a pointer to a buffer, the velocity, position and direction of the sound, and the intensity of the sound. The listener object contains the velocity, position and direction of the listener, and the general gain applied to all sound. Buffers contain audio data in PCM format, either 8- or 16-bit, in either monaural or stereo format. The rendering engine performs all necessary calculations for distance attenuation, Doppler effect, etc.

The net result of all of this for the end user is that in a properly written OpenAL application, sounds behave quite naturally as the user moves through the three-dimensional space of the virtual world. From a programmer&#x27;s perspective, very little additional work is required to make this happen in an existing OpenGL-based 3D graphical application.

Unlike the OpenGL specification, the OpenAL specification includes two subsections of the API: the core consisting of the actual OpenAL function calls, and the ALC (Audio Library Context) API which is used to manage rendering contexts, resource usage and locking in a cross platform manner. There is also an &#x27;ALUT&#x27; (Audio Library Utility Toolkit) library that provides higher level &#x27;convenience&#x27; functions — exactly analogous to OpenGL&#x27;s &#x27;GLUT&#x27;.

In order to provide additional functionality in the future, OpenAL utilizes an extension mechanism. Individual vendors are thereby able to include their own extensions into distributions of OpenAL, commonly for the purpose of exposing additional functionality on their proprietary hardware. Extensions can be promoted to ARB (Architecture Review Board) status, indicating a standard extension which will be maintained for backwards compatibility. ARB extensions have the prospect of being added to the core API after a period of time.

For advanced digital signal processing and hardware-accelerated sound effects, the EFX (Effects Extension) or environmental audio extensions (EAX) can be used.

==Limitations==
The &quot;single listener&quot; model in OpenAL is tailored to a single human user and is not fit for artificial intelligence or robotic simulations or multiple human participants as in collaborative musical performances.
In these cases a multiple listener model is required. OpenAL also fails to take into account &quot;sound propagation delays&quot; (the speed of sound is used for the Doppler effect only). The distance to a sound source only translates into an amplitude effect (attenuation) and not a delay. Hence OpenAL cannot be used for time difference of arrival calculations unless that functionality is added in separately.

In order to take full speed advantage of OpenAL, a vendor/hardware specific implementation is needed and these are seldom released as open source. Many supported platforms in fact implement OpenAL as a wrapper which simply translates calls to the platform&#x27;s native, and often proprietary, audio API. On Windows, if a vendor specific implementation is not detected it will fall back to the wrap_oal.dll wrapper library that translates OpenAL into DirectSound (Generic Software) or DirectSound3D (Generic Hardware); the removal of the latter from Windows Vista onward has effectively broken generic hardware acceleration on modern versions of Windows.

==Supported platforms==
The API is available on the following platforms and operating systems: Android (supports OpenSL ES), AmigaOS 3.x and 4.x, Bada, BlackBerry 10, BlackBerry PlayBook, BSD, iOS (supports Core Audio), IRIX, Linux (supports ALSA, OSS, PortAudio and PulseAudio), Mac OS 8, Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X (Core Audio), Microsoft Windows (supports DirectSound, Windows Multimedia API and Windows Multimedia Device (MMDevice) API), MorphOS, OpenBSD, Solaris, QNX, and AROS.

Supported gaming devices are for instance: GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox, Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation Portable.

==Implementations==
;OpenAL SI
: The OpenAL Sample Implementation is the original implementation, from Loki, and is not currently maintained.
;OpenAL Soft
: OpenAL Soft is an LGPL-licensed, cross-platform, software implementation. The library is meant as a free compatible update/replacement to the now-deprecated and proprietary OpenAL Sample Implementation. OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo (including HRTF and UHJ), 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, and B-Format output. Ambisonic assets are supported.
;AeonWave-OpenAL
: AeonWave-OpenAL is an LGPL-licensed OpenAL emulation layer that takes advantage of the hardware acceleration provided by the non-free but low cost AeonWave 4D-audio library for Linux and Windows made by Adalin B.V. The author claims that AeonWave-OpenAL implementation renders 3D audio five (on an AMD Athlon 64 X2) to seven (on an Intel Atom N270) times faster than either OpenAL SI or OpenAL Soft under the same conditions. By using the AeonWave library this implementation supports HRTF as well as spatialised surround sound for up to eight speakers.
;Rapture3D OpenAL Driver
: The Rapture3D OpenAL Driver is a non-free, commercial, Windows only, software implementation made by Blue Ripple Sound. The library is intended as a high performance drop-in replacement for other implementations. It features:
:* 32bit floating point audio path.
:* High quality sample rate conversion (used for various purposes including Doppler shift).
:* High quality effects and filters.
:* Support for multi-channel sound sources (including assets encoded using Ambisonics).
:* The only limit on the number of sources or effects is CPU power, can render hundreds of sound sources and multiple effects on relatively old hardware.
:* Higher-order Ambisonics (HOA) bus running at up to fourth order.
;Apple OpenAL
:Apple ships an implementation of OpenAL in macOS and iOS. It is a very thin layer over the 3D Mixer (kAudioUnitSubType_3DMixer) feature in the operating system. This implementation was originally written by Ryan C. Gordon for Altivec Mac OS X systems.
;MojoAL
:Tiny (single-file), full OpenAL 1.1 implementation built on top of SDL2 by Ryan C. Gordon.

<doc id="563962" wikidata="Q5408769" url="?curid=563962" title="Hooker with a heart of gold">
<text>The hooker with a heart of gold is a stock character involving a courtesan or prostitute who possesses virtues such as integrity, generosity and kindness.

==Characteristics==
The character type is defined by morally positive traits, which are contrasted with the character&#x27;s employment as a prostitute. The narrative will often provide extenuating circumstances for the character&#x27;s prostitution, and emphasize her personal decency. Sometimes, the character will be a foil for another female character who reflects negative stereotypes of uptight or frigid women. According to Nell Damon Galles, the character is &quot;the good girl who made one too many bad decisions—losing her virginity, becoming promiscuous, and eventually entering the dark world of prostitution.&quot; The &quot;hooker with a heart of gold&quot; has also been described as a &quot;modern &#x27;secular&#x27; counterpart&quot; of the medieval sinner-saint.

==Historical development==
Prostitutes appear in ancient Greek literature as far back as the Archaic period, such as in the work of Archilochus, though initially with little focus on their moral qualities. The good prostitute (or more specifically good hetaira, a type of high-end prostitute) emerged as a stereotype in middle ancient Greek comedy for example in Antiphanes&#x27;s &quot;Hydria&quot;. The good prostitute appeared even more frequently in new ancient Greek comedy. The work of Menander has long been known for its treatment of the trope. Such as in a &quot;much discussed&quot; passage of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Table talks&quot; where Plutarch commends Menander as suitable for use at Symposia, as the dramatist had his heroes break off relations with bad prostitutes, but sometimes marry them if they were good.

In classical Roman literature, the prostitute was commonly portrayed as especially selfish; the stereotypically bad woman against whom the &quot;femina bona&quot; (good woman, typically a loyal wife) was contrasted. This stigma against prostitutes largely persisted in Western society from Roman times until at least the start of the 21st century. Nevertheless, the prostitute with a heart of gold still appeared quite frequently in Roman writings from around the time of Terence; for example in Terence&#x27;s &quot;Hecyra&quot; and in Livy&#x27;s semi fictionalised account of Hispala Faecenia. The Roman prostitute with a heart of gold was however invariably portrayed as an exception to the norm for prostitutes to be selfish and greedy. Unlike the Greek &quot;good hetaera&quot;, who could sometimes end up marrying elite men, the Roman prostitute with a heart of gold was expected to know her place at the margins of Roman society, though there were exceptions.

Subsequent development of the stereotype may also have drawn inspiration from traditions surrounding the Biblical figures of Mary Magdalene and Rahab, or to the ancient Indian theatrical tradition of Sanskrit drama where Śudraka&#x27;s play &quot;Mṛcchakatika&quot; (&quot;The Little Clay Cart&quot;) featured a nagarvadhu (courtesan) with a heart of gold named Vasantasena.

In French literature, early appearances of the hooker with the heart of gold occurred towards the end of the 18th century, including Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;The Loves of Milord Edouard Bromston&quot; (1780). These 18th-century works generally had sad endings, showing that despite her heart of gold, the prostitute was typically unable to gain acceptance into mainstream society. Following the conclusion of the French Revolution in 1799, there were a few years where various minor novelists published happier tales for prostitutes with a heart of gold, in the then prevailing spirit of egalitarianism. This soon ended after Napoleon introduced various rules regulating prostitution from 1802 to 1804; few hooker with a heart of gold characters appeared over the next few decades. This began to change towards the middle of the 19th century, with various leading French authors including prostitutes with a heart of gold in their writings, such as Victor Hugo&#x27;s play &quot;Marion de Lorme&quot; (1828) and novels like Eugène Sue&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot; (1843) and Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes&quot; (1838-1847).

The 1848 French novel by Alexandre Dumas fils, &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot;, later saw many translations and adaptations into plays and movies, in English under the name &quot;Camille&quot;, and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;La Traviata&quot; (1853). The original work was based on a real-life prostitute, Marie Duplessis, with whom Dumas had a relationship. According to Charles Bernheimer, a French work that most subverted the hooker with the heart of gold stereotype was Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam&#x27;s &quot;Contes cruels&quot; - there the prostitute was well regarded while she plied her trade in conventional fashion, but was derided once she fell in love.

In American cinema, prostitutes were generally portrayed sympathetically even from the earliest films, though the hooker with a heart of gold was relatively rare until the 1980s. Some early examples of movies featuring a hooker with a heart of gold are the 1917 and 1918 versions of &quot;Camille&quot;, 1932&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; with Marlene Dietrich and the 1939 movie &quot;Stagecoach&quot;. From European sources, mainstream portrayals were begun to be seen by the early 1960s in internationally-popular films such as &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; and &quot;Irma la Douce.&quot; The &quot;hooker with a heart of gold&quot; archetype became most prominent in American cinema during the 1980s, peaking with &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. The development of the trope reflected a more lighthearted cultural attitude toward prostitution, which nonetheless overall condemned women for the social transgression of prostitution. The character of Mona in &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982) exemplifies the era&#x27;s hooker with a heart of gold: a wonderful woman whose goodness is surprising and amusing because she is also a prostitute, and whose love interest berates her for prostitution. These films have been criticized as akin to sexploitation films for the way they present a glamorized and male-dominated view of prostitution. The hooker with a heart of gold has also been criticized as a &quot;pathetic cliché&quot;.

The character of Ophelia played by Jamie Lee Curtis in the 1983 comedy &quot;Trading Places&quot; also represents an example of a hooker with a heart of gold, according to some reviewers.

<text>Sir Michael Checkland (born 13 March 1936) is a retired British television executive, who was Director-General of the BBC from 1987 to 1992, being appointed after the forced resignation of Alasdair Milne.

== Early life ==

Michael Checkland was educated at the state grammar school King Edward VI Five Ways in Birmingham, and Wadham College, Oxford, of which he was appointed an Honorary Fellow in 1989. After leaving Oxford he worked first as an auditor at Parkinson Cowan Ltd and then as an accountant at Thorn.

== Career at the BBC 1964–87 ==

Checkland joined the BBC in 1964 as a senior cost accountant and in 1969 he was promoted to be head of the Central Finance Unit and chief accountant for Central Finance Services. In 1971 he moved to BBC TV, where he was successively chief accountant (1971–76), financial controller (1976–77), controller of planning and resource management (1977–82), and director of resources (1982–85). He had meanwhile been a director of Visnews from 1980 until 1985. In 1985 he was appointed Deputy Director-General of the Corporation, and at the same time he became vice president of the Royal Television Society, a position he retained until 1994. In 1986 he became Chairman of BBC Enterprises, of which he had been a director since 1979. The following year he became Director-General upon the resignation of Alasdair Milne. This appointment coincided with a term of office as president of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association from until 1988.

== Director-General of the BBC ==

As a former BBC accountant (hence his somewhat derogatory nickname &quot;Michael Chequebook or Chequebook Checkland&quot;) he was more cautious and less radical than Milne, and therefore much less unsettling to the Thatcher government. It has been claimed that the exodus to Channel 4 in the early 1990s of dramatists like Dennis Potter and Alan Bleasdale, who had both been responsible for series which caused outrage among Conservatives during the Milne era, had much to do with the relative lack of risk-taking at the BBC under Checkland and his successor John Birt, who was deputy director-general throughout Checkland&#x27;s reign.

== After the BBC ==

Following his departure from the BBC, Checkland suggested at a Royal Television Society conference that the corporation&#x27;s governors and the chairman Marmaduke Hussey had been out of touch: they thought, as he put it, that &quot;FM&quot; (as in FM radio) &quot;stood for fuzzy monsters!&quot; 

Following his retirement from the BBC, Checkland became closely associated with the National Children&#x27;s Homes charity. He has since become involved in a range of other charities and public bodies: Director of the National Youth Music Theatre (1992–2002), Chairman of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (1995–2001), Governor of Westminster College, Oxford (1993–97), Governor of Birkbeck College London (1993–97), Visiting Professor at the International Academy of Broadcasting, Montreux (1995–97), the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors (1994-2000), and Chairman of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (1997–2001).

In 1997-8 he was elected vice-president of the British Methodist Conference, the highest lay position in the church.
He is a trustee of Reuters, chairman of Horsham YMCA, chairman of Horsham Arts Festival, chairman of the University of Brighton and a board member of the Wales Millennium Centre. He was a member of the Independent Television Commission from 1997 to 2003, and chairman of Brighton Festival from 1993 to 2002.

Michael Checkland now lives in Sussex and has three children and two grandchildren.

<text>was a Japanese Buddhist leader, author, educator and nuclear disarmament advocate. He served as the third president and then honorary president of the Soka Gakkai, which is considered among the largest of Japan&#x27;s new religious movements but has also been described as a cult by some media and politicians (e.g., the French parliamentary commission in 1995).

Ikeda was the founding president of the Soka Gakkai International. Soka Gakkai claims Japanese membership of 8.27 million households. Recent research and surveys suggest that between 2.5 million and 4 million people - approximately two to three percent of the Japanese population - are active members of Soka Gakkai, and the organization claims to have approximately 11 million practitioners in 192 countries and territories, more than 1.5 million of whom reside outside of Japan as of 2012. 

Ikeda was the founder of a variety of educational and cultural institutions including Soka University, Soka University of America, Min-On Concert Association and Tokyo Fuji Art Museum. In Japan, he was also known for his international outreach to China. 

Ikeda has been described as controversial over the decades due to the ambivalent reputation of the Soka Gakkai and his relation to the political party Kōmeitō, which he founded. He has been the subject of numerous articles, questions and accusations in Japanese and international media.At his death, scholars and journalists described Ikeda as among the most polarizing and important figures in modern Japanese religion and politics.

==Early life and background==
Ikeda Daisaku was born in Ōta, Tokyo, Japan, on 2 January 1928. Ikeda had four older brothers, two younger brothers, and a younger sister. His parents later adopted two more children, for a total of 10 children. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the Ikeda family had successfully farmed &quot;nori&quot;, edible seaweed, in Tokyo Bay. By the turn of the twentieth century, the Ikeda family business was the largest producer of &quot;nori&quot; in Tokyo. The devastation of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake left the family&#x27;s enterprise in ruins. Ikeda&#x27;s eldest brother, Kiichi, died in the Imphal Campaign in Burma, in January 1945, during the last stages of World War II. Ikeda also suffered from tuberculosis in his younger days. 

In August 1947, at the age of 19, Ikeda was invited by an old friend to attend a Buddhist discussion meeting. It was there that he met Josei Toda, the second president of Japan&#x27;s Soka Gakkai Buddhist organization. Ikeda began practicing Nichiren Buddhism and joined the Soka Gakkai. He regarded Toda as his spiritual mentor and became a charter member of the group&#x27;s youth division.
==Career==

Shortly after the end of World War II, in January 1946, Ikeda gained employment with the Shobundo Printing Company in Tokyo. In March 1948, Ikeda graduated from Toyo Trade School and the following month entered the night school extension of Taisei Gakuin (present-day Tokyo Fuji University) where he majored in political science. During this time, he worked as an editor of the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Shonen Nihon&quot; (Boy&#x27;s Life Japan), which was published by one of Josei Toda&#x27;s companies.

In 1953, at the age of 25, Ikeda was appointed as one of the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s youth leaders. The following year, he was appointed as director of the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s public relations bureau, and later became its chief of staff.

In 1952, Ikeda was one of the leaders in violently harassing Nichiren Shoshu priest Jimon Ogasawara. Ogasawara had allegedly cooperated with the authorities during the war against Soka Gakkai&#x27;s founder Tsunesaburō Makiguchi, who had died imprisoned, before the end of the war. Ikeda and Toda headed a group of 4,000 men belonging to the Youth Division to the Taiseki-ji, the Nichiren Shōshū head temple. When Ogasawara initially refused to apologize, the men tore off his vestments and tagged him with a placard reading &quot;Racoon dog monk.&quot; He was then forcibly carried to Makiguchi&#x27;s grave, where he was made to sign a written apology. Ikeda, who admitted to hitting the priest &quot;once or twice&quot; later referred to the incident as an &quot;act of kindness&quot; because &quot;the old priest, made to realize his apostasy, was grateful to Toda and Soka Gakkai and died a happy man.&quot;

In July 3, 1957, Ikeda was arrested on charges of violating the election law and spent two weeks in jail in Osaka. He was taken into custody in his capacity as Sōka Gakkai&#x27;s Youth Division Chief of Staff for overseeing activities that constituted violations of elections law. He was finally exonerated of all charges in 1962.

===Soka Gakkai presidency===

In May 1960, two years after Toda&#x27;s death, Ikeda, then 32 years old, succeeded him as president of the Soka Gakkai. Later that year, Ikeda began to travel overseas to build connections between Soka Gakkai members living abroad and expand the movement globally.

As a president, Ikeda continued fusing the ideas and principles of educational pragmatism with the elements of Buddhist doctrine. He reformed many of the organization&#x27;s practices, including the aggressive conversion style known as shakubuku, for which the group had been criticized in Japan and in other countries. The organization &quot;had provoked public opprobrium because of its aggressive recruitment policies and its strongly developed political base.&quot;

In 1979, Ikeda resigned as president of the Soka Gakkai (in Japan), in compliance with the demands of the Nichiren Shōshū priesthood . Hiroshi Hōjō succeeded Ikeda as Soka Gakkai president, and Ikeda was made honorary president.

Ikeda continued to be revered as the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s spiritual leader, according to Asian studies associate professor Daniel Métraux. Métraux in 1994 wrote that &quot;adulation of Ikeda in the Gakkai press gives some non-member readers the impression that the Gakkai is little more than an Ikeda personality cult&quot;. One reason for the excommunication of Soka Gakkai by Nichiren Shōshū in 1991 was, according to the &quot;Nichiren Shoshu&quot; entry in &quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism&quot;, &quot;Nichiren Shōshū accusing Sōka Gakkai of forming a personality cult around their leader Ikeda&quot; and &quot;Soka Gakkai accusing the Nichiren Shoshu leader Abe Nikken of trying to dominate both organizations.&quot; Sociologist of religion Peter Beyer in 2006 summarizes an understanding in the context of contemporary global society: &quot;Until the 1990s, Soka Gakkai still was related formally to the monastic organization, Nichiren Shoshu, but conflicts over authority led to their separation (Métraux 1994).&quot;

===Soka Gakkai International founding===
By the 1970s, Ikeda&#x27;s leadership had expanded the Soka Gakkai into an international lay Buddhist movement increasingly active in peace, cultural, and educational activities. On 26 January 1975, Soka Gakkai representatives from 51 countries created the Soka Gakkai International. Ikeda took a leading role in the global organization&#x27;s development and became the founding president of the Soka Gakkai International.

==Critics and controversies==

===Reputation===
Ikeda has elicited a variety of assessments from scholars and journalists. According to Asian studies professor Daniel Métraux in 1994, Ikeda is &quot;possibly one of the more controversial figures in Japan&#x27;s modern history&quot;.

In 1996, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Ikeda as &quot;the most powerful man in Japan - and certainly one of the most enigmatic&quot;, &quot;condemned and praised as a devil and an angel, [...] a despot and a democrat&quot;. 

In 1984, Polly Toynbee, grand-daughter of British historian Arnold Toynbee, whose conversations with Ikeda were published, was invited by Ikeda to meet him in Japan. Following her visit, she wrote a critical article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; on meeting the leader. She writes: 

&quot;On the long flight to Japan, I read for the first time my grandfather&#x27;s posthumously, published book, &quot;Choose Life -- A Dialogue&quot;.. . . My grandfather [...] was 85 when the dialogue was recorded, a short time before his final incapacitating stroke (...) My grandfather never met Ikeda on his visits to Japan. His old Japanese friends were clearly less than delighted with lkeda&#x27;s grandiose appropriation of his memories. Several days passed before we were to meet our mysterious host, time in which we learned more about Mr Ikeda and his Soka Gakkai movement. One thing above allo others was made clear: this was an organisation of immense wealth, power and political influence (...) Asked to hazard a guess at his occupation, few would have selected him as a religious figure. I have met many powerful men—prime ministers, leaders of all kinds—but I have never in my life met anyone who exuded such an aura of absolute power as Mr Ikeda&quot;.

===Religion and politics===
In the history of institutional relations between the religious movement Soka Gakkai and the political party Kōmeitō founded in 1964 by Ikeda as an outgrowth from Soka Gakkai, he has faced &quot;unabated criticism against the alleged violation of the separation of religion and state&quot; and been accused of &quot;far-reaching political ambitions.&quot; Associate professor of government George Ehrhardt and co-authors write that &quot;Sōka Gakkai&#x27;s entrance into the political arena [...] permanently transformed the relationship between religion and politics in Japan by dividing those who opposed the creation of a religious political party from those who accepted it.&quot;

In 2015, addressing the &quot;party&#x27;s understudied history,&quot; political scientist Steven Reed and his co-authors write that &quot;the image of Kōmeitō as a mere political branch of Sōka Gakkai is clearly mistaken&quot; and that &quot;the separation between party and religious group announced by Ikeda Daisaku in 1970 made a real difference.&quot; He also states that &quot;sōka gakkai meetings are used to introduce Kōmeitō candidates and to advertise the party, particularly during the period leading up the election.&quot;
About &quot;the changing role of the Komeito in Japanese politics in the 1990s&quot;, Daniel Métraux states that: &quot;While it is difficult to determine his exact role, an examination of his daily itinerary would reveal that he would have very little time personally for political management and that most of the aging leader&#x27;s time is devoted to religious affairs, traveling, and writing. Ikeda may well have influenced the Komeito in a macrosense, but in a microsense he is clearly not involved. The Komeito and its successes have a life of their own; they are certainly not lifeless puppets ready to react to Ikeda&#x27;s or to the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s every whim.&quot;

A lot of newspapers and scholars have proven though that, despite the formal separation, there are still &quot;strong links&quot; and that the Komeito has remained to some extent the &quot;political arm&quot; of Soka Gakkai.

===Censorship===
In 1970, there was a freedom of speech controversy about the intent to prevent the publication of Hirotatsu Fujiwara&#x27;s polemical book, &quot;I denounce Soka Gakkai&quot;, that vehemently criticized Ikeda, Soka Gakkai and the Komeito. In his 3 May 1970 speech, addressing, among others, Soka Gakkai members, guests and news media, Ikeda responded to the controversy by: apologizing to the nation &quot;for the trouble...the incident caused,&quot; affirming the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s commitment to free speech and religious freedom, announcing a new policy of formal separation between the Soka Gakkai religious movement and Komeito, calling for both moderation in religious conversion practices and democratizing reforms in the Soka Gakkai, and envisioning a Buddhist-inspired humanism. 

In October 1982, Ikeda had to appear in court concerning three cases.

==Philosophy and beliefs==
Ikeda&#x27;s relationship with his mentor, Jōsei Toda, and influence of Tsunesaburō Makiguchi&#x27;s educational philosophy, shaped his emphasis on dialogue and education as fundamental to building trust between people and peace in society. He interprets the Middle Way as a path between idealism and materialism.

Ikeda&#x27;s use of the term &quot;ōbutsu myōgō&quot; in his 1964 book &quot;Seiji shūkyō&quot; (Politics and Religion) has been interpreted to mean &quot;politics by people, with mercy and altruism as a Buddhist philosophy, different from the union of politics and religion (&quot;seikyo icchi&quot;).&quot; The term is also used by Ikeda in the Komeito&#x27;s founding statement. In the 1969 edition of &quot;Seiji shūkyō&quot;, &quot;he declared that &quot;obutsu myogo&quot; would not be an act of Soka Gakkai imposing its will on the Japanese state to install Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism as the national creed,&quot; and that &quot;Soka Gakkai, through Komeito, would instead guide Japan to a new, democratic world order, a &#x27;Buddhist democracy&#x27; (&quot;buppo minshu shugi&quot;) combining the Dharma with the best of the Euro-American philosophical tradition to focus on social welfare and humanistic socialism.&quot; Another interpretation of his views at that time was that &quot;Buddhist democracy&quot; could be achieved by a &quot;religious revolution&quot; through &quot;kōsen-rufu&quot; on the premise of achieving &quot;social prosperity in accordance with individual happiness&quot; for the entire society. In 1970, after Ikeda announced the severing of official ties between the Soka Gakkai and Komeito, the use of &quot;politically charged terms such as &quot;obutsu myogo&quot;&quot; was eliminated. 

Ikeda refers in several writings to the Nine Consciousness as an important conception for self-transformation, identifying the ninth one, &quot;amala-vijñāna&quot;, with the Buddha-nature. According to him, the &quot;transformation of the karma of one individual&quot; can lead to the transformation of the entire society and humankind.

==Accomplishments==
===Institutional engagement===
Ikeda founded a number of institutions to promote education, cultural exchange and the exchange of ideas on peacebuilding through dialogue. They include: Soka University in Tokyo, Japan, and Soka University of America in Aliso Viejo, California; the Victor Hugo House of Literature, in France; the International Committee of Artists for Peace in the United States; the Min-On Concert Association in Japan...

From 1990, Ikeda partnered with Rabbi Abraham Cooper and the Simon Wiesenthal Center to address anti-Semitic stereotypes in Japan. 

===Peace proposals===
Since 26 January 1983, Ikeda had submitted annual peace proposals to the United Nations, addressing such areas as building a culture of peace, gender equality in education, empowerment of women, youth empowerment and activism for peace, UN reform and universal human rights with a view on global civilization. 

Ikeda&#x27;s proposals for nuclear disarmament and abolishing nuclear weapons were submitted to the special session of the UN General Assembly in 1978, 1982 and 1988. 

===Citizen diplomacy===
Ikeda has described his travels, meetings and dialogues as citizen diplomacy. 
Researchers linked to Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai have suggested the body of literature chronicling Ikeda&#x27;s diplomatic efforts and his international dialogues provide readers with a personalized global education and model of citizen diplomacy.

First in 1967 then several times in 1970, Ikeda met with Austrian-Japanese politician and philosopher Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, founder of the Paneuropean Movement. Their discussions which focused on east–west relations and the future of peace work were serialized in the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; newspaper in 1971. In 1974, Ikeda conducted a dialogue with French novelist and then former Minister of Cultural Affairs Andre Malraux.

In January 1975, Ikeda met with Henry Kissinger, then United States Secretary of State, to &quot;urge the de-escalation of nuclear tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.&quot; The same month Ikeda met with Secretary-General of the United Nations Kurt Waldheim. Ikeda presented Waldheim with a petition containing the signatures of 10,000,000 people calling for total nuclear abolition. The petition was organized by youth groups of the Soka Gakkai International and was inspired by Ikeda&#x27;s longtime anti-nuclear efforts.

Ikeda&#x27;s meetings with Nelson Mandela in the 1990s led to a series of Soka Gakkai International-sponsored anti-apartheid lectures, a traveling exhibit, and multiple student exchange programs at the university level. Their October 1990 meeting in Tokyo led to collaboration with the African National Congress and the United Nations Apartheid Center on an anti-apartheid exhibit inaugurated in Yokohama, Japan &quot;on the 15th anniversary of the Soweto uprisings (16 June 1976).&quot;

===Sino-Japanese relations===
Ikeda made several visits to China and met with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1974, though Sino-Japanese tensions remained over the brutalities of war waged by the Japanese militarists. The visits led to the establishment of cultural exchanges, and opened academic exchanges between Chinese educational institutions and Soka University. Chinese media describe Ikeda as an early proponent of normalizing diplomatic relations between China and Japan in the 1970s, citing his 1968 proposal that drew condemnation by some and the interest of others including Zhou Enlai. It was said that Zhou Enlai entrusted Ikeda with ensuring that &quot;Sino-Japanese friendship would continue for generations to come.&quot;

==Accolades==
==Personal life==
Ikeda lived in Tokyo with his wife, Kaneko Ikeda (née Kaneko Shiraki), whom he married on 3 May 1952. The couple had three sons, Hiromasa, Shirohisa (died 1984), and Takahiro.

Hiromasa Ikeda is the executive vice-president of the Soka Gakkai International and trustee of the Soka University in Japan.

Takahiro Ikeda is director of the Soka School System, the educational corporation of the Sôka Gakkai.

Daisaku Ikeda died on 15 November 2023, at the age of 95. His death was publicly announced on 18 November.

==Books==
===Dialogue with Toynbee===
The 1976 publication of &quot;Choose Life: A Dialogue&quot; (in Japanese, &quot;Nijusseiki e no taiga&quot;) is the published record of dialogues and correspondences that began in 1971 between Ikeda and British historian Arnold J. Toynbee about the &quot;convergence of East and West&quot; on contemporary as well as perennial topics ranging from the human condition to the role of religion and the future of human civilization. As of 2012, the book had been translated and published in twenty-six languages. 

But Toynbee being &quot;paid well&quot; for the interviews with Ikeda raised criticism : &quot;he accepted the dialogue with the controversial Ikeda primarily for the money&quot;, according to historian Louis Turner. To an expat&#x27;s letter critical of Toynbee&#x27;s association with Ikeda and Soka Gakkai, Toynbee wrote back: &quot;I agree with Soka Gakkai on religion as the most important thing in human life, and on opposition to militarism and war.&quot;

===Main books===
Ikeda&#x27;s most well-known publication is the novel The Human Revolution, which is an autobiography in 30 volumes, but with great freedoms in relation to the facts.

In their 1984 book &quot;Before It Is Too Late&quot;, Ikeda and Aurelio Peccei discuss the human link in the ecological consequences of industrialization, calling for a reform in understanding human agency to effect harmonious relationships both between humans and with nature.

In &quot;Life—An Enigma, a Precious Jewel&quot; (1982), &quot;Unlocking the Mysteries of Birth and Death&quot; (1984), discussions of a Buddhist ontology offer an alternative to anthropocentric and biocentric approaches to wildlife conservation.

The sixteen conversations between Lou Marinoff and Ikeda in their book &quot;The Inner Philosopher&quot; (2012) introduce classic Eastern and Western philosophers.

===Column in the Japan Times===
In 2003, Japan&#x27;s largest English-language newspaper, &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, began carrying Ikeda&#x27;s contributed commentaries on global issues. By 2015, &quot;The Japan Times&quot; had published 26 of them. But the column raised criticism among the Japan Times&#x27; journalists, who protested their disagreement with Ikeda&#x27;s writing in 2006.

<text>François Gérard Georges Nicolas Hollande (; born 12 August 1954) is a French politician who served as President of France from 2012 to 2017. Before his presidency, he was First Secretary of the Socialist Party (PS) from 1997 to 2008, Mayor of Tulle from 2001 to 2008, as well as President of the General Council of Corrèze from 2008 to 2012. He also has also held the 1st constituency of Corrèze seat in the National Assembly three times, first from 1988 to 1993, then from 1997 to 2012, and from 2024 onwards.

Born in Rouen and raised in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hollande began his political career as a special advisor to newly elected President François Mitterrand before serving as a staffer for Max Gallo the government&#x27;s spokesman. He became a member of the National Assembly in 1988 and was elected First Secretary of the PS in 1997. Following the 2004 regional elections won by the PS, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but he resigned as First Secretary and was immediately elected to replace Jean-Pierre Dupont as President of the General Council of Corrèze in 2008. In 2011, Hollande announced that he would be a candidate in the primary election to select the PS presidential nominee; he won the nomination against Martine Aubry before he was elected to the presidency (becoming also, &quot;ex officio&quot;, Co-Prince of Andorra) on 6 May 2012 in the second round with 51.6% of the vote, defeating incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy.

During his tenure, Hollande legalized same-sex marriage by passing Bill no. 344, reformed labour laws and credit training programmes, signed a law restricting the &quot;cumul des mandats&quot;, and withdrew French forces in Afghanistan, in addition to concluding an EU directive on the protection of animals in laboratory research through a Franco-German contract. Hollande led the country through the January and November 2015 Paris attacks, as well as the 2016 Nice attack. He was a leading proponent of EU mandatory migrant quotas and NATO&#x27;s 2011 military intervention in Libya. He also sent troops to Mali and the Central African Republic with the approval of the UN Security Council in order to stabilise those countries, two operations however largely seen as failures. He drew controversy among his left-wing electoral base for supporting the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

Under Hollande’s presidency, Paris hosted the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and his efforts to bring the 2024 Summer Olympics to the city were successful. However, with domestic troubles – in particular due to Islamic terrorism – over the course of his tenure, and unemployment rising to 10%, he faced spikes and downturns in approval rates, ultimately making him the most unpopular head of state under the Fifth Republic. On 1 December 2016, he announced he would not seek reelection in the 2017 presidential election, for which polls suggested his defeat in the first round.

==Early life and education==
Hollande was born on 12 August 1954 in Rouen. His mother, Nicole Frédérique Marguerite Tribert (1927–2009), was a social worker, and his father, Georges Gustave Hollande (1922–2020), was a retired ear, nose, and throat doctor, who &quot;ran for local election on a far right ticket in 1959&quot;. The name &quot;Hollande&quot; meant &quot;one originally from Holland&quot; – it is mostly found in Hollande&#x27;s ancestral land, Hauts-de-France, and it is speculated to be Dutch in origin. The earliest known member of the Hollande family lived near Plouvain, working as a miller.

When Hollande was thirteen, the family moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, a highly exclusive suburb of Paris. He attended Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-la-Salle boarding school, a private Catholic school in Rouen, the Lycée Pasteur, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, receiving his baccalaureate in 1972 then graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Law from Panthéon-Assas University. Hollande studied at HEC Paris, graduated in 1975, and then attended the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris and the École nationale d&#x27;administration (ENA). He completed his military service in the French Army in 1977. He graduated from the ENA in 1980, and chose to enter the prestigious Cour des comptes.

Hollande lived in the United States in the summer of 1974 while he was a university student. Immediately after graduation, he was employed as a councillor in the Court of Audit.

==Early political career==
Five years after volunteering as a student to work for François Mitterrand&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful campaign in the 1974 presidential election, Hollande joined the Socialist Party. He was quickly spotted by Jacques Attali, a senior adviser to Mitterrand, who arranged for Hollande to run in legislative election of 1981 in Corrèze against future President Jacques Chirac, who was then the leader of the Rally for the Republic, a Neo-Gaullist party. Hollande lost to Chirac in the first round.

He went on to become a special advisor to newly elected President Mitterrand, before serving as a staffer for Max Gallo, the government&#x27;s spokesman. After becoming a municipal councillor for Ussel in 1983, he contested Corrèze for a second time in 1988, this time being elected to the National Assembly. Hollande lost his bid for re-election to the Assembly in the so-called &quot;blue wave&quot; of the 1993 election, described as such due to the number of seats gained by the Right at the expense of the Socialist Party.

===First Secretary of the Socialist Party (1997–2008)===

As the end of Mitterrand&#x27;s term in office approached, the Socialist Party was torn by a struggle of internal factions, each seeking to influence the direction of the party. Hollande pleaded for reconciliation and for the party to unite behind Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, but Delors renounced his ambitions to run for the French presidency in 1995. Former party leader Lionel Jospin resumed his position, and selected Hollande to become the official party spokesman. Hollande went on to contest Corrèze once again in 1997, successfully returning to the National Assembly.

That same year, Jospin became the Prime Minister of France, and Hollande won the election for his successor as First Secretary of the party, a position he would hold for eleven years. Because of the very strong position of the Socialist Party within the French government during this period, Hollande&#x27;s position led some to refer to him the &quot;Vice Prime Minister&quot;. Hollande would go on to be elected mayor of Tulle in 2001, an office he would hold for the next seven years.

The immediate resignation of Jospin from politics following his shock defeat by far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen in the first round of the 2002 presidential election forced Hollande to become the public face of the party for the 2002 legislative election. Although he managed to limit defeats and was re-elected in his own constituency, the Socialists lost nationally. In order to prepare for the 2003 party congress in Dijon, he obtained the support of many notable personalities of the party and was re-elected first secretary against opposition from left-wing factions.

After the triumph of the Left in the 2004 regional elections, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but the Socialists were divided on the European Constitution, and Hollande&#x27;s support for the ill-fated &quot;Yes&quot; position in the French referendum on the European constitution caused friction within the party. Although Hollande was re-elected as first secretary at the Le Mans Congress in 2005, his authority over the party began to decline. Eventually his domestic partner, Ségolène Royal, was chosen to represent the party in the 2007 presidential election, where she would lose to Nicolas Sarkozy.

Hollande was widely blamed for the poor performances of the Socialist Party in the 2007 elections, and he announced that he would not seek another term as First Secretary. Hollande publicly declared his support for Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, but it was Martine Aubry who would go on to win the race to succeed him in 2008. Hollande was next elected to replace Jean-Pierre Dupont as the president of the General Council of Corrèze in April 2008, and won re-election in 2011.

===2012 presidential campaign===
Hollande announced in early 2011 that he would be a candidate in the upcoming primary election to select the Socialist and Radical Left Party presidential nominee. The primary marked the first time that both parties had held an open primary to select a joint nominee at the same time. He initially trailed the front-runner, former finance minister and International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Following Strauss-Kahn&#x27;s arrest on suspicion of sexual assault in New York City in May 2011, Hollande began to lead the opinion polls, and his position as front-runner was established just as Strauss-Kahn declared that he would no longer seek the nomination. After a series of televised debates with other candidates throughout September, Hollande topped the ballot in the first round held on 9 October with 39% of the vote. He did not, however, gain the 50% required to avoid a run-off election, and was obliged to enter a second ballot against Martine Aubry, who had come in second with 30% of the vote.

The second ballot took place on 16 October 2011. Hollande won with 56% of the vote to Aubry&#x27;s 43% and thus became the official Socialist and Radical Left Party candidate for the 2012 presidential election. All his main opponents in the primary – Aubry, Ségolène Royal, Arnaud Montebourg, and Manuel Valls – pledged their support to him for the general election.
Hollande&#x27;s presidential campaign was managed by Pierre Moscovici and Stéphane Le Foll, a member of Parliament and Member of the European Parliament respectively. Hollande launched his campaign officially with a rally and major speech at Le Bourget on 22 January 2012 in front of 25,000 people. The main themes of his speech were equality and the regulation of finance, both of which he promised to make a key part of his campaign.

On 26 January, he outlined a full list of policies in a manifesto containing 60 propositions, including the separation of retail activities from riskier investment-banking businesses; raising taxes on big corporations, banks and the wealthy; creating 60,000 teaching jobs; bringing the official retirement age back down to 60 from 62; creating subsidised jobs in areas of high unemployment for the young; promoting more industry in France by creating a public investment bank; granting marriage and adoption rights to same-sex couples; and pulling French troops out of Afghanistan in 2012. On 9 February, he detailed his policies specifically relating to education in a major speech in Orléans.

Incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy announced on 15 February that he would run for a second and final term, strongly criticising the Socialist proposals and claiming that Hollande would bring about &quot;economic disaster within two days of taking office&quot;. Opinion polls showed a tight race between the two men in the first round of voting, with most polls showing Hollande comfortably ahead of Sarkozy in a hypothetical second round. The first round of the presidential election was held on 22 April. François Hollande came in first place with 28.63% of the vote, and faced Nicolas Sarkozy in a run-off. In the second round of voting on 6 May 2012, Hollande was elected with 51.6% of the vote.

==President of France (2012–2017)==

Hollande was inaugurated on 15 May 2012, and shortly afterwards appointed Jean-Marc Ayrault to be his Prime Minister. He was the first Socialist Party president since François Mitterrand left office in 1995. The President of the French Republic is one of the two joint heads of state of the Principality of Andorra. Hollande hosted a visit from Antoni Martí, head of the government, and Vicenç Mateu Zamora, leader of the parliament.

He also appointed Benoît Puga to be the military&#x27;s chief of staff, Pierre-René Lemas as his general secretary and Pierre Besnard as his Head of Cabinet. Hollande&#x27;s full Council of Ministers became the first ever in France to show gender parity, with 17 men and 17 women, and each member was required to sign a new &quot;code of ethics&quot; that placed significant restrictions on their conduct and compensation, above that of existing law. The first measure enacted by the new government was to lower the salaries of the President, the Prime Minister, and other members of the government by 30%.

===Budget===
Hollande&#x27;s economic policies are wide-ranging, including supporting the creation of a European credit rating agency, the separation of lending and investment in banks, reducing the share of electricity generated by nuclear power in France from 75 to 50% in favour of renewable energy sources, merging income tax and the General Social Contribution (CSG), creating an additional 45% for additional income of 150,000 euros, capping tax loopholes at a maximum of €10,000 per year, and questioning the relief solidarity tax on wealth (ISF, &quot;Impôt de Solidarité sur la Fortune&quot;) measure that should bring €29 billion in additional revenue. Hollande also signalled his intent to implement a 75% income tax rate on revenue earned above 1,000,000 euros per year, to generate the provision of development funds for deprived suburbs, and to return to a deficit of zero per cent of GDP by 2017. The tax plan proved controversial, with courts ruling it unconstitutional in 2012, only to then take the opposite position on a redrafted version in 2013.

Hollande had also announced several reforms to education, pledging to recruit 60,000 new teachers, to create a study allowance and means-tested training, and to set up a mutually beneficial contract that would allow a generation of experienced employees and craftsmen to be the guardians and teachers of younger newly hired employees, thereby creating a total of 150,000 subsidized jobs. This was complemented by the promise of aid to SMEs, with the creation of a public bank investment-oriented SME&#x27;s, and a reduction of the corporate tax rate to 30% for medium corporations and 15% for small.

Hollande&#x27;s government has announced plans to construct 500,000 public homes per year, including 150,000 social houses, funded by a doubling of the ceiling of the Livret A, the region making available its local government land within five years. In accordance with long-standing Socialist Party policy, Hollande has announced that the retirement age will revert to 60, for those who have contributed for more than 41 years.

===Marriage and adoption for same-sex couples===

Hollande has also announced his personal support for same-sex marriage and adoption for LGBT couples, and outlined plans to pursue the issue in early 2013. In July 2012, Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that &quot;In the first half of 2013, the right to marriage and adoption will be open to all couples, without discrimination&quot;, confirming this election promise by Hollande.
The bill to legalize same-sex marriage, known as Bill no. 344, was introduced to the National Assembly of France on 7 November 2012. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the bill in a 329–229 vote. The Right-wing opposed the bill. The Senate approved the full bill with a 171–165 majority on 12 April with minor amendments. On 23 April, the National Assembly approved the amended bill, in a 331–225 vote, and following approval of the law by the Constitutional Council of France, it was signed into law by President Hollande on 18 May 2013, with the first same-sex weddings under the law taking place eleven days later.

===Labour reform===

As President, Hollande pursued labour reform to make France more competitive internationally. Legislation for this, introduced in late 2012, after much debate passed the French lower and upper house in May 2013. The bill included measures such as making it easier for workers to change jobs and for companies to fire employees. One of the main measures of the bill allowed companies to temporarily cut workers&#x27; salaries or hours during times of economic difficulty. This measure took its inspiration from Germany, where furloughs have been credited with allowing companies to weather difficult times without resorting to massive layoffs. Layoffs in France are often challenged in courts and the cases can take years to resolve. Many companies cite the threat of lengthy court action – even more than any financial cost – as the most difficult part of doing business in France. The law shortens the time that employees have to contest a layoff and also lays out a scheme for severance pay. The government hopes this will help employees and companies reach agreement faster in contentious layoffs.

Another key measure introduced was credits for training that follow employees throughout their career, regardless of where they work, and the right to take a leave of absence to work at another company. The law will also require all companies to offer and partially pay for supplemental health insurance. Lastly, the law also reforms unemployment insurance, so that someone out of work doesn&#x27;t risk foregoing significant benefits when taking a job that might pay less than previous work or end up only being temporary. Under the new law, workers will be able to essentially put benefits on hold when they take temporary work, instead of seeing their benefits recalculated each time.

===Pension reform===
As President, Hollande pursued reform to the pension system in France. The process proved to be very contentious, with members of Parliament, Labor Unions, and general public all opposed. Mass protests and demonstrations occurred throughout Paris. Despite the opposition, the French Parliament did pass a reform in December 2013 aimed at plugging a pension deficit expected to reach 20.7 billion euros ($28.4 billion) by 2020 if nothing were to be done. Rather than raising the mandatory retirement age, as many economists had advised, Hollande pursued increases in contributions, leaving the retirement age untouched. The reform had a rough ride in parliament, being rejected twice by the Senate, where Hollande&#x27;s Socialist Party has a slim majority, before it won sufficient backing in a final vote before the lower house of parliament. French private sector workers saw the size and duration of their pension contributions increase only modestly under the reform while their retirement benefits were largely untouched.

===Foreign affairs===

As President, Hollande promised an early withdrawal of French combat troops present in Afghanistan in 2012. He also pledged to conclude a new contract of Franco-German partnership, advocating the adoption of a Directive on the protection of public services. Hollande has proposed &quot;an acceleration of the establishment of a Franco-German civic service, the creation of a Franco-German research office, the creation of a Franco-German industrial fund to finance common competitiveness clusters, and the establishment of a common military headquarters&quot;. As well as this, Hollande has expressed a wish to &quot;combine the positions of the presidents of the European Commission and of the European Council (currently held by José Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy respectively) into a single office [...] and that it should be directly chosen&quot; by the members of the European Parliament.
On 11 January 2013, Hollande authorised the execution of Operation Serval, which aimed to curtail the activities of Islamist extremists in the north of Mali. The intervention was popularly supported in Mali, as Hollande promised that his government would do all it could to &quot;rebuild Mali&quot;. During his one-day visit to Bamako, Mali&#x27;s capital, on 2 February 2013, he said that it was &quot;the most important day in [his] political life&quot;. In 2014, Hollande took some of these troops out of Mali and spread them over the rest of the Sahel under Operation Barkhane, in an effort to curb jihadist militants. On 27 February 2014, Hollande was a special guest of honor in Abuja, received by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in celebration of Nigeria&#x27;s amalgamation in 1914, a 100-year anniversary. In July 2014, Hollande expressed support for Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, and told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, &quot;France strongly condemns these aggressions [by Hamas].&quot;
In September 2015, Hollande warned former Eastern Bloc countries against rejecting the EU mandatory migrant quotas, saying: &quot;Those who don&#x27;t share our values, those who don&#x27;t even want to respect those principles, need to start asking themselves questions about their place in the European Union&quot;.

Hollande supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, re-supplying the Saudi military. France authorised $18 billion (€16 billion) in arms sales to Saudi Arabia in 2015.

In 2014, French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran at that time. In October 2016, Hollande said: &quot;When the (European) Commission goes after Google or digital giants which do not pay the taxes they should in Europe, America takes offence. And yet, they quite shamelessly demand 8 billion from BNP or 5 billion from Deutsche Bank.&quot;

===Approval ratings===
An IFOP poll released in April 2014 showed that Hollande&#x27;s approval rating had dropped five points since the previous month of March to 18%, dipping below his earlier low of 20% in February during the same year. In November 2014, his approval rating reached a new low of 12%, according to a YouGov poll. Following the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting in January 2015, however, approval for Hollande increased dramatically, reaching 40% according to an IFOP poll two weeks after the attack, though an Ipsos-Le Point survey in early February showed his rating declining back to 30%.

Hollande ultimately registered the least popularity for a president of the French Fifth Republic. In September 2014, his approval rating was down to 13% according to an IFOP/JDD survey. One year before the end of his mandate, in April 2016, his approval rating was placed at 14%, and surveys predicted that if he were to run for a second term, he would be defeated in the first round of the 2017 presidential elections. In November 2016, a poll found Hollande&#x27;s approval rating to be just 4%.

On 8 May 2012, Hollande took part in the commemorations of the end of the Second World War, alongside Nicolas Sarkozy, following the latter&#x27;s invitation.

On 10 May 2012, the Constitutional Council announced the official results of the presidential election; and on 15 May 2012, the transfer of power took place.

== Post-presidential life ==

While refusing to sit on the Constitutional Council, of which he is an &quot;ex-officio&quot; member, François Hollande continues to comment publicly on French and international political life through several books and university lectures., In his books, he is critical of the domestic policies of his successor Emmanuel Macron, but also of his former left-wing political rival Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who led the left-wing union in the 2022 legislative elections.

On 12 November 2023, he participated in the March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism in Paris in response to the rise in antisemitism since the start of the Israel–Hamas war.

=== Return to National Assembly (2024) ===
On 15 June 2024, Hollande announced his candidacy for the New Popular Front in the first constituency of Corrèze for the 2024 French legislative election. Hollande&#x27;s decision to contest the election was considered surprising, including among fellow PS members.

He qualified, in first place, for a three-way second round against candidates from the National Rally and The Republicans, and was elected with 43 percent of the vote in the runoff.

==Personal life==

For twenty nine years, his partner was fellow Socialist politician Ségolène Royal. In June 2007, just a month after Royal&#x27;s defeat in the French presidential election of 2007, the couple announced that they were separating.

A few months after his split from was announced, a French website published details of a relationship between Hollande and French journalist Valérie Trierweiler. In November 2007, Trierweiler confirmed and openly discussed her relationship with Hollande in an interview with the French weekly &quot;Télé 7 Jours&quot;. She remained a reporter for the magazine &quot;Paris Match&quot;, but ceased work on political stories. Trierweiler moved into the Élysée Palace with Hollande when he became president and started to accompany him on official travel.

On 25 January 2014, Hollande officially announced his separation from Valérie Trierweiler after the tabloid magazine &quot;Closer&quot; revealed his affair with actress Julie Gayet. In September 2014, Trierweiler published a book about her time with Hollande titled &quot;Merci pour ce moment (Thank You for This Moment)&quot;. The memoir claimed the president presented himself as disliking the rich, but in reality disliked the poor. The claim brought an angry reaction and rejection from Hollande, who said he had spent his life dedicated to the under-privileged.

On 4 June 2022, Hollande married Gayet in Tulle, France.

Hollande was raised Catholic, but became an agnostic later in life. He now considers himself to be an atheist, but still professes respect for all religious practices.

Hollande is commonly nicknamed Flanby, a popular dessert similar to flan, as it embodies a political wobbliness and pudginess often attributed to him by his critics.

<doc id="563977" wikidata="Q3151081" url="?curid=563977" title="Filgrastim">
<text>Filgrastim, sold under the brand name Neupogen among others, is a medication used to treat low neutrophil count. Low neutrophil counts may occur with HIV/AIDS, following chemotherapy or radiation poisoning, or be of an unknown cause. It may also be used to increase white blood cells for gathering during leukapheresis. It is given either by injection into a vein or under the skin. Filgrastim is a leukocyte growth factor.
Common side effects include fever, cough, chest pain, joint pain, vomiting, and hair loss. Severe side effects include splenic rupture and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Filgrastim is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). It works by stimulating the body to increase neutrophil production.
Filgrastim was approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Filgrastim biosimilar medications are available.

==Medical uses==
Filgrastim is used to treat neutropenia; acute myeloid leukemia; nonmyeloid malignancies; leukapheresis; congenital neutropenia‚ cyclic neutropenia‚ or idiopathic neutropenia; and myelosuppressive doses of radiation.

Tbo-filgrastim (Granix) is indicated for reduction in the duration of severe neutropenia in people with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.

==Adverse effects==
The most commonly observed adverse effect is mild bone pain after repeated administration, and local skin reactions at the site of injection. Other observed adverse effects include serious allergic reactions (including a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling around the mouth or eyes, fast pulse, and sweating), ruptured spleen (sometimes resulting in death), alveolar hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hemoptysis. Severe sickle cell crises, in some cases resulting in death, have been associated with the use of filgrastim in people with sickle cell disorders.

== Interactions ==
Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone imaging changes; this should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results.

==Mechanism of action==
G-CSF is a colony stimulating factor which has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production of other haematopoietic cell types. Neupogen (filgrastim) is the name for recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF).

==Society and culture==

===Biosimilars===
In 2015, Sandoz&#x27;s filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio), obtained the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a biosimilar. This was the first product to be passed under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), as part of the Affordable Care Act. Zarxio was approved as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product, the FDA notes. And under the BPCI Act, only a biologic that has been approved as an &quot;interchangeable&quot; may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The FDA said its approval of Zarxio is based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates Zarxio is biosimilar to Neupogen.

In 2018, filgrastim-aafi (Nivestym) was approved for use in the United States.

In September 2008, Ratiograstim, Tevagrastim, Biograstim, and Filgrastim ratiopharm were approved for use in the European Union. Filgrastim ratiopharm was withdrawn in July 2011 and Biograstim was withdrawn in December 2016.

In February 2009, Filgrastim Hexal and Zarzio were approved for use in the European Union.

In June 2010, Nivestim was approved for use in the European Union.

In October 2013, Grastofil was approved for use in the European Union.

In September 2014, Accofil was approved for use in the European Union.

In 2016, Fraven was approved for use by Republic of Turkey ministry of health.

Nivestym was approved for medical use in Canada in April 2020.

In October 2021, Nypozi was approved for medical use in Canada.

In February 2022, filgrastim-ayow (Releuko) was approved for medical use in the United States.

In June 2024, filgrastim-txid (Nypozi) was approved for medical use in the United States.

In December 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Zefylti, intended for the treatment of neutropenia and the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells. The applicant for this medicinal product is CuraTeQ Biologics s.r.o. Zefylti is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product Neupogen (filgrastim), which has been authorized in various EU countries. Zefylti was authorized for medical use in the European Union in February 2025.

===Economics===
Shortly after it was introduced, analyses of whether filgrastim is a cost-effective way of preventing febrile neutropenia depended upon the clinical situation and the financial model used to pay for treatment. The longer-acting pegfilgrastim may in some cases be more cost-effective.

<text>Desmond Dillon Paul Morton (1937–2019) was a Canadian historian and political advisor who specialized in the history of the Canadian military, as well as the history of Canadian political and industrial relations.

== Life and career ==
Born on September 10, 1937, in Calgary, Alberta, Morton was the son of a Brigadier General, and the grandson of General Sir William Dillon Otter. A Rhodes Scholar at Keble College, Oxford, Morton graduated from the Collège militaire royal de St-Jean, the Royal Military College of Canada, and the London School of Economics. He received his doctorate from the University of London. He spent ten years in the Canadian Army (1954–1964 retiring as a Captain) prior to beginning his teaching career. He was named Honorary Colonel of 8 Wing of the Canadian Air Force at CFB Trenton in 2002. He received the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration in 2004 for 12 years total military service.

Morton was the Hiram Mills Professor of History at McGill University, as well as the founding director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, established in 1994, in Montreal, Quebec. Following his retirement, he continued to serve at McGill as a professor emeritus. Prior to that, he was Principal of Erindale College, University of Toronto, from 1986 to 1994. He served as president of the Canadian Historical Association from 1978-1979. 

Before beginning his teaching career, Morton served as an advisor to Tommy Douglas of the New Democratic Party. From 1964 to 1966, he served as assistant secretary of the Ontario New Democratic Party. After the success of the famous 1964 NDP Riverdale by-election, Morton wrote and published &quot;The Riverdale Story&quot;, which detailed how the party&#x27;s organizing and canvassing changed the way campaigns in Canada are run. In the 1970s he worked with David Lewis, Stephen Lewis, and other party leaders to oppose The Waffle, a left-wing faction within the NDP. In the 1980s he informally advised Brian Mulroney of the Progressive Conservatives.

Morton was the author of over thirty-five books on Canada, including the popular &quot;A Short History of Canada&quot;. In 1994 he won the C.P. Stacey Prize for his history of Canadian soldiers during the First World War, &quot;When Your Number&#x27;s Up&quot;. He wrote prolifically about the First World War, considering it of great importance in Canadian history. He once wrote: &quot;For Canadians, Vimy Ridge was a nation-building experience. For some, then and later, it symbolized the fact that the Great War was also Canada&#x27;s war of independence&quot;.

In 1996, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. Morton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1985.

Morton&#x27;s widow Gael Eakin, to whom he was married for 20 years, announced that he died on September 4, 2019, six days short of his 82nd birthday.

<doc id="563980" wikidata="Q1129511" url="?curid=563980" title="Look-and-say sequence">
<text>In mathematics, the look-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:

: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, 31131211131221, ... .

To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:

* 1 is read off as &quot;one 1&quot; or 11.
* 11 is read off as &quot;two 1s&quot; or 21.
* 21 is read off as &quot;one 2, one 1&quot; or 1211.
* 1211 is read off as &quot;one 1, one 2, two 1s&quot; or 111221.
* 111221 is read off as &quot;three 1s, two 2s, one 1&quot; or 312211.

The look-and-say sequence was analyzed by John Conway
after he was introduced to it by one of his students at a party.

The idea of the look-and-say sequence is similar to that of run-length encoding.

If started with any digit &quot;d&quot; from 0 to 9 then &quot;d&quot; will remain indefinitely as the last digit of the sequence. For any &quot;d&quot; other than 1, the sequence starts as follows:
: &quot;d&quot;, 1&quot;d&quot;, 111&quot;d&quot;, 311&quot;d&quot;, 13211&quot;d&quot;, 111312211&quot;d&quot;, 31131122211&quot;d&quot;, …
Ilan Vardi has called this sequence, starting with &quot;d&quot; = 3, the Conway sequence . (for &quot;d&quot; = 2, see )

== Basic properties ==
=== Growth ===
The sequence grows indefinitely. In fact, any variant defined by starting with a different integer seed number will (eventually) also grow indefinitely, except for the degenerate sequence: 22, 22, 22, 22, ... which remains the same size.

=== Digits presence limitation ===
No digits other than 1, 2, and 3 appear in the sequence, unless the seed number contains such a digit or a run of more than three of the same digit.

=== Cosmological decay ===
Conway&#x27;s cosmological theorem asserts that every sequence eventually splits (&quot;decays&quot;) into a sequence of &quot;atomic elements&quot;, which are finite subsequences that never again interact with their neighbors. There are 92 elements containing the digits 1, 2, and 3 only, which John Conway named after the 92 naturally-occurring chemical elements up to uranium, calling the sequence audioactive. There are also two &quot;transuranic&quot; elements (Np and Pu) for each digit other than 1, 2, and 3. Below is a table of all such elements:
=== Growth in length ===
The terms eventually grow in length by about 30% per generation. In particular, if &quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the number of digits of the &quot;n&quot;-th member of the sequence, then the limit of the ratio formula_1 exists and is given by
formula_2

where λ = 1.303577269034... is an algebraic number of degree 71. This fact was proven by Conway, and the constant λ is known as Conway&#x27;s constant. The same result also holds for every variant of the sequence starting with any seed other than 22.

==== Conway&#x27;s constant as a polynomial root ====
Conway&#x27;s constant is the unique positive real root of the following polynomial :
formula_3

This polynomial was correctly given in Conway&#x27;s original &quot;Eureka&quot; article,
but in the reprinted version in the book edited by Cover and Gopinath the term formula_4 was incorrectly printed with a minus sign in front.

== Popularization ==
The look-and-say sequence is also popularly known as the Morris Number Sequence, after cryptographer Robert Morris, and the puzzle &quot;What is the next number in the sequence 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221?&quot; is sometimes referred to as the Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg, from a description of Morris in Clifford Stoll&#x27;s book &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot;.

==Variations==

There are many possible variations on the rule used to generate the look-and-say sequence. For example, to form the &quot;pea pattern&quot; one reads the previous term and counts all instances of each digit, listed in order of their first appearance, not just those occurring in a consecutive block. So beginning with the seed 1, the pea pattern proceeds 1, 11 (&quot;one 1&quot;), 21 (&quot;two 1s&quot;), 1211 (&quot;one 2 and one 1&quot;), 3112 (&quot;three 1s and one 2&quot;), 132112 (&quot;one 3, two 1s and one 2&quot;), 311322 (&quot;three 1s, one 3 and two 2s&quot;), etc. This version of the pea pattern eventually forms a cycle with the two &quot;atomic&quot; terms 23322114 and 32232114.

Other versions of the pea pattern are also possible; for example, instead of reading the digits as they first appear, one could read them in ascending order instead . In this case, the term following 21 would be 1112 (&quot;one 1, one 2&quot;) and the term following 3112 would be 211213 (&quot;two 1s, one 2 and one 3&quot;). This variation ultimately ends up repeating the number 21322314 (&quot;two 1s, three 2s, two 3s and one 4&quot;).

These sequences differ in several notable ways from the look-and-say sequence. Notably, unlike the Conway sequences, a given term of the pea pattern does not uniquely define the preceding term. Moreover, for any seed the pea pattern produces terms of bounded length: This bound will not typically exceed (22 digits for decimal: ) and may only exceed (30 digits for decimal radix) in length for long, degenerate, initial seeds (sequence of &quot;100 ones&quot;, etc.). For these extreme cases, individual elements of decimal sequences immediately settle into a permutation of the form where here the letters are placeholders for digit counts from the preceding sequence element.

Since the sequence is infinite, and the length of each element is bounded, it &quot;must&quot; eventually repeat, due to the pigeonhole principle. As a consequence, pea pattern sequences are always eventually periodic.

<text>Ségolène Royal (; born Marie-Ségolène Royal; 22 September 1953) is a French politician who took part in the 2007 French presidential election, losing to Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round. She was the first woman in France&#x27;s history to reach the second round in a presidential election.

Royal was president of the Poitou-Charentes Regional Council from 2004 to 2014. She won the 2006 Socialist Party primary, becoming the first woman in France to be nominated as a presidential candidate by a major party. In the subsequent 2007 presidential election, she earned further distinction as the first woman to qualify for the second round of a presidential election, but ultimately lost to Nicolas Sarkozy.

In 2008, Royal narrowly lost to Martine Aubry in the Socialist Party&#x27;s election for First Secretary at the Party&#x27;s twenty-second national congress. She lost the Socialist Party presidential primary in 2011, and failed in an attempt to win a seat in the National Assembly in the June 2012 parliamentary elections.

She has four children with François Hollande, the former president, and was appointed by him to the vice-chair directorship of the Banque Publique d&#x27;Investissement (BPI) in 2013. She served as Minister for Ecology from 2014 to 2017, in the Valls, then Cazeneuve cabinets.

==Early life==
Marie-Ségolène Royal was born on 22 September 1953 in the military base of Ouakam, Dakar, French West Africa (now Senegal), the daughter of Hélène Dehaye and Jacques Royal, a former artillery officer and aide to the mayor of Chamagne (Vosges). Her parents had eight children in nine years: Marie-Odette, Marie-Nicole, Gérard, Marie-Ségolène, Antoine, Paul, Henri and Sigisbert.

After secondary school in the small town of Melle, Deux-Sèvres, Marie-Ségolène attended a local university where she graduated 2nd in her class with a degree in economics. Her eldest sister then suggested she prepare the entrance exam to the elite Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris popularly called &quot;Sciences Po&quot;, which she attended on scholarship. There she discovered politics of class and feminism (&quot;Sciences Po&quot; at the time was 85% upper-class Parisian, mostly male).

In 1972, at the age of 19, Royal sued her father because he refused to divorce her mother and pay alimony and child support to finance the children&#x27;s education. She won the case after many years in court, shortly before Jacques Royal died of lung cancer in 1981. Six of the eight children had refused to see him again, Ségolène included.

Royal, like the majority of France&#x27;s political elite, is a graduate of the École nationale d&#x27;administration. She was in the same class as her former partner of 30 years, François Hollande, as well as Dominique de Villepin (prime minister under Jacques Chirac). Each class year at the ENA receives a nickname to distinguish it: Royal tried to get her peers to name their class after Louise Michel, a revolutionary from the 1870s, but they chose the name &quot;Voltaire&quot; instead. During her time at the ENA, Royal also dropped &quot;Marie&quot; from her hyphenated first name.

== Political career ==

=== Beginnings ===
After graduating in 1980, she elected to serve as a judge (&quot;conseiller&quot;) of an administrative court before she was noticed by President François Mitterrand&#x27;s special adviser Jacques Attali and recruited to his staff in 1982. She held the junior rank of &quot;chargée de mission&quot; from 1982 to 1988.

=== Member of the French National Assembly ===
She decided to become a candidate for the 1988 legislative election; she registered in the rural, Western Deux-Sèvres Département. Her candidacy was an example of the French political tradition of &quot;parachutage&quot; (parachuting), appointing promising &quot;Parisian&quot; political staffers as candidates in provincial districts to test their mettle. She was up against an entrenched UDF incumbent, and Mitterrand is said to have told her: &quot;You will not win, but you will next time.&quot; Straddling strongly Catholic and Protestant areas, that district had been held by conservatives since World War II.
She did win against the odds, and remarked: &quot;Pour un parachutage, l&#x27;atterrissage est réussi.&quot; (&quot;As far as parachuting goes, the landing was a success&quot;).

After this election, she served as representative in the National Assembly for the Deux-Sèvres&#x27; 2nd constituency (1988–1992, 1993–1997, 2002–2007).

=== Ministerial offices ===
*Minister of Environment: 1992–1993.
*Minister of School Education: 1997–2000.
*Minister of Family and Children: 2000–2001.
*Minister of Family, Children and Disabled persons: 2001–2002.

=== President of the Region Poitou-Charentes ===
On 28 March 2004, she obtained 55% in the second round in the regional election in Poitou-Charentes, notably defeating Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin&#x27;s protégée, Élisabeth Morin, in his home region. She was elected president of the region the next week. She kept her National Assembly seat until June 2007, when she chose not to run in the legislative election, in agreement with one of her presidential campaign&#x27;s promises. She organised a run-off between two contenders; the winner, Delphine Batho, went on to win the district for her and Royal&#x27;s party.

=== 2007 presidential candidacy ===


On 22 September 2005, &quot;Paris Match&quot; published an interview in which she declared that she was considering running for the presidency in 2007. In 2006 the CPE (first employment contract) laws were proposed with large protests as a result. Rather than going to the organised protest, she voted a law in her &quot;région&quot; whereby no company using that type of contract would receive the Région&#x27;s subsidies. The government backed down and stated that the law would be put on the statute book, but that it would not be applied. After this event Royal was tipped as the lead contender in what is dubbed the &quot;Sarko-Ségo&quot; race against Nicolas Sarkozy.

By the beginning of September 2006, her intentions had become quite clear. She has said that only widespread sexism in the Socialist Party had prevented it from rallying around her candidacy as it would have had she been a man. She announced an official team to promote her campaign on 30 August. At this point, polls showed her to be much more popular than her closest competitor, former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and other Socialist heavyweights Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Jack Lang, another former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and François Hollande.

Her status as a presidential candidate became more likely on 28 September 2006, when Lionel Jospin, the Socialist former Prime Minister and a fixture in French politics for nearly three decades, announced that he would not run after all. Jack Lang followed suit. On 16 November, Royal defeated Laurent Fabius and Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the French Socialist Party primary, becoming the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2007 presidential election. The Socialist party&#x27;s members voted 60.69% for her and gave a bit under 20% each to the more traditional contenders. She also won in 101 of 104 of the Socialist Party&#x27;s &quot;fédérations&quot;, losing only Haute-Corse, Mayotte and Seine-Maritime (the latter being the home region of Laurent Fabius).

One of her top advisors, Éric Besson, resigned soon afterwards over a disagreement about the costs of this programme, which he believes could reach €35 billion, while others in the campaign team wanted to delay bringing out that figure.[The figure was equivalent to that of Mr. Sarkozy&#x27;s but higher than Mr. Bayrou&#x27;s, who was becoming a key figure in the race.] This led to an unusually bitter fall-out, and Mr Besson writing a book titled &quot;Qui connaît Madame Royal ?&quot; (Who knows Mrs Royal?), published on 20 March. In it, Besson accuses Royal of being a populist, an authoritarian and a luddite and says that he will not vote for her and hopes that she is not elected. He then went on to join the Sarkozy campaign and was rewarded with a junior position in the next government on 18 May 2007.

Following the first round of the presidential election, she faced Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round of voting on 6 May in a two-way runoff.
In the final round of voting on Sunday, 6 May, Sarkozy won the presidency with 53% of the vote. Royal conceded defeat and wished Sarkozy the best, requesting he keep her supporters in mind.

Royal later revealed she had offered defeated centrist candidate, François Bayrou, the premiership should she be elected.

=== 2008 Socialist Party leadership election ===

Royal entered the leadership election of the Socialist Party to replace her former common law husband François Hollande as head of the party. She garnered the largest plurality of votes in the first round of voting, but not enough to win outright; she was eventually narrowly defeated in the second round by rival Martine Aubry by the margin of 42 votes. After a vote recount, Aubry was declared the winner 25 November 2008, with the margin widening to 102 votes. Royal has announced her intentions to contest the result. Royal has blamed party leaders and her former partner for her loss in the 2007 election.

=== 2011 Socialist Party presidential primary ===

Royal ran in the French Socialist Party presidential primary election of 2011, the party&#x27;s first ever open primary. She arrived 4th in the first round on 9 October 2011 with a mere 6.95% of votes, considerably below the figures suggested by opinion polls.

=== Defeat in the 2012 legislative election ===
In 2012, Royal ran for office representing Charente-Maritime&#x27;s 1st constituency. She lost the election to a PRG candidate, Olivier Falorni.

After her separation with Hollande, political relations between them were tense, though they have both stated that they remained friends. In the 2008 Socialist Party leadership election, Hollande backed another candidate, and Royal has blamed him and the party establishment for her 2007 Presidential defeat.

=== 2014 return to government ===
On 2 April 2014 Royal was appointed Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy in the second cabinet of Prime Minister Manuel Valls. In January 2015 she was third in line in governmental rank, after the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.

Increasingly, commentators have seen Royal as President François Hollande’s stand-in for some important state occasions. When Pope Francis touched down on French soil for the first time in his papacy with a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2014, Royal was the senior French official there to greet him. After the deadly attacks against a satirical newspaper and a kosher supermarket in January 2015, she travelled to Israel to represent France at the memorial services.
In 2016 Royal promised to install 1,000 km of &#x27;solar roadways&#x27; in the next five years. One kilometre was installed in Normandie, and after producing about a quarter of the power predicted, was mostly torn up inside three years.

=== 2017–2020: Ambassador for the Arctic and Antarctic ===
When Emmanuel Macron was elected French President in May 2017, Royal hoped to be offered a position in his government but instead was offered the position of Ambassador for the Poles, which she accepted in June 2017. In late 2018 the publication of Royal&#x27;s book &quot;Ce que je peux enfin vous dire&quot; (What I can finally tell you) detailing the sexism she had suffered throughout her political career, coincided with a decline in Macron&#x27;s popularity at the time of the Gilets jaunes protests and resulted in speculation that Royal was contemplating a political comeback. After repeatedly and publicly criticising Macron&#x27;s handling of pension reform, it was announced by the Council of Ministers that the Mission to the Poles would be ended, effectively removing Royal from her position, in tandem with an official investigation being launched inquiring about alleged misuse of public funds during Royal&#x27;s time in office.

==Policies==
Royal has tended to campaign on family and other socially-oriented issues, rather than on economic or foreign policy issues. For instance, she has mounted campaigns against the exposure of children to violent television shows, including cartoons (see her 1989 book, listed below, &quot;Le Ras-le-bol des bébés zappeurs&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;The Channel-Surfing Kids Are Fed Up&quot;), and more generally has taken a stand on several issues regarding family values and the protection of children.

Royal stated as part of her 100-point platform that if elected, she would raise the lowest state pensions by five per cent, increase the monthly minimum wage to €1,500, raise benefits of handicapped citizens, implement state-paid rental deposits for the poorest citizens, and guarantee a job or job training to every student within six months of graduation. She pledged to abolish a flexible work contract for small companies. She pledged free contraception for all young women and a €10,000 interest-free loan for all young people.

===Economy===

Royal opposes movements of jobs between EU countries and outsourcing to developing countries. She pledged to abolish a flexible work contract for small companies. She did not directly address whether additional taxes would need to be raised to fund these programs, stating that they can be paid for by cutting waste in government.
She was appointed to the vice-chair directorship of the Banque Publique d&#x27;Investissement, from which position she stated that the &quot;BPI&#x27;s purpose is not to do business nor to make profits&quot;.

===Environment===
The Socialist Party website states that during her tenure as &quot;Minister for the Environment&quot;, 1992–1993, Royal campaigned actively and successfully for the &quot;Law on the treatment and recycling of Waste&quot; (), the &quot;Law to preserve the countryside&quot; (), a &quot;Save our countrysides, savour their products&quot; campaign to provide proper labelling for the products of 100 local areas (), and the &quot;Law against noise pollution&quot; (). She provided compensation for people adversely affected by airport noise.

===Education===
During her tenure as Minister-delegate for the Family, Children, and the Handicapped, 2000–2002, Royal was active in the re-launch of the Priority Education Zones program (ZEP / zone d&#x27;éducation prioritaire), the creation of a government student lunch program, the implementation of language instruction as a priority in primary schools, the creation of a national home-tutoring program, Heures de Soutien Scolaire, and the creation of programs for parental involvement in schools, &quot;la Semaine des parents à l&#x27;école&quot;, and national campaigns for the elections of parent-representatives. She also campaigned for the creation of local education and citizenship education contracts, the &quot;Initiatives citoyennes&quot; program for teaching children how to live together, the law on &quot;Defense of children&#x27;s rights and campaign against violence in the schools&quot; (&quot;Loi de juin 1998 relative à la prévention et à la répression des infractions sexuelles ainsi qu&#x27;à la protection des mineurs&quot;), the &quot;Campaign against hazing rituals in higher education&quot; (&quot;Loi de juin 1998 contre le bizutage&quot;), the &quot;Campaign against violence and racketeering&quot; which included implementation of the &quot;SOS Violence&quot; telephone number, and the implementation of mandatory civics instruction in secondary schools.

In January 2006, she criticised secondary school teachers (workers of state public service) who give private lessons outside school hours, saying that they should spend more time in school. When a bootleg video of the speech surfaced on the Internet in November 2006, the teachers&#x27; union SNES rebuffed her, requesting that she renounce her proposal.

===Family and social affairs===

In 1989, Royal wrote &quot;The Channel-Surfing Kids Are Fed-Up&quot;, a book in which she criticised Japanese animation (then dominant in certain TV programs) as poor quality production detrimental for children.

Royal favours, and has worked for, the &quot;Parental rights and obligations act&quot; (&quot;Loi sur l&#x27;autorité parentale&quot;), the &quot;Women&#x27;s rights reform and anonymous childbirth act&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;accouchement sous X&quot;), the creation of paternity leave, the creation of 40,000 new spaces in French nursery schools, and &quot;Social housing reform&quot;. She has been active in campaigns providing for &quot;Parental time-off provisions and financial support for child illness care&quot;, Special education support (&quot;parents d&#x27;enfants handicapés&quot;), &quot;Benefit allocations for students starting the new school year&quot; (&quot;Allocation de rentrée scolaire&quot;), and the &quot;Prostitution of Minors Act&quot; (&quot;Loi contre la prostitution des mineurs&quot;) which provides penal measures for clients. Royal has supported the &quot;Law against child pornography&quot;, the creation of the association &quot;Childhood and the Media&quot; (&quot;Enfance et média&quot;) against violence in the media, the creation of the &quot;Plan Handiscole&quot; for the education of handicapped children and adolescents and their integration into life at school, programs for mass and individual transportation, and the creation of the program &quot;Tourism and the Handicapped&quot; (&quot;Tourisme et handicap&quot;).
In 2009, she declared herself to be &quot;profoundly shocked&quot; by statements of Pope Benedict XVI which claimed that the distribution of condoms will not stop the spread of AIDS. Royal added that &quot;the responsibility of any religious leader&quot; is to &quot;defend the principle of life, and certainly not to urge human beings towards their deaths.&quot;

When she accepted her nomination as the Socialist presidential candidate, Royal said: &quot;There is a strong correlation between the status of a woman and the state of justice or injustice in a country.&quot; According to an article in Ms. magazine, French women currently earn 80% of a male counterpart&#x27;s salary.

Royal has been a long-standing critic of violence on television. She has voiced opinions in the past linking youth crime to exposure to pornography and television violence.
She also described the M6 programme &quot;Loft Story&quot;, imitating the internationally popular &quot;Big Brother TV series&quot;, as contrary to principles of human dignity and risking transforming viewers into voyeurs instead of providing quality programming.

A law passed in February 2002, introduced by Royal on behalf of the Jospin government, allows some parental authority to be granted to same-sex partners. The law amended Article 377 of the Civil Code in allowing a parent to ask a judge to share his/her parental authority with a partner. Article 377–1, added by the law, ensures that &quot;delegation may provide, for the needs of education of a child, that the father and mother, or one of them, shall share all or part of the exercise of parental authority with the third person delegatee&quot;.

In a June 2006 interview with LGBT publication &quot;Têtu&quot;, Royal said &quot;opening up marriage to same-sex couples is needed in the name of equality, visibility and respect&quot; and said that if her party formed the next government she would introduce a bill to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption.

According to her 2007 campaign website, Royal has advocated a policy of more humane prisons and supports creating better conditions inside penal institutions. The website states that she supports a system of rehabilitating offenders and reintegrating them into society.

==Foreign policy==
Royal initially appeared to have few opinions on several notable foreign policy subjects, such as the accession of Turkey to the European Union, merely responding, &quot;my opinion is that of the French people.&quot; On the subject of the Iranian nuclear program, Royal also took conflicting positions. She initially took a very hard line in a televised debate, contending that any nuclear power programme in Iran must be prevented since it would inevitably lead to weapons production. When she was criticised by French politicians for not understanding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – which gives signatories the right to nuclear power for non-military purposes – Royal softened her position and, through a spokesman, said that a civil nuclear program should be allowed as long as UN inspectors were permitted to conduct spot checks.

===International tours===

====Middle East====
In early December 2006, controversy followed a brief tour of the Middle East. Meeting Hezbollah politician Ali Ammar, she took exception to his use of the euphemism &quot;Zionist entity&quot;, but did not take issue with his comparison of the Palestinian territories to France under German occupation during World War II. This attracted criticism in France and in Israel which Royal visited next. However, the French ambassador to Lebanon, Bernard Emié, backed her explanation that she did not hear &quot;the offending remarks&quot; – the discussion took place via an interpreter supplied by the Lebanese parliament. In the same visit, Royal thanked the minister for being so &quot;frank&quot; when he described US foreign policy in the Middle East as &quot;unlimited American insanity&quot;.

====China====
Royal visited China in January 2007; after speaking with a lawyer in that country she noted to the press that he had pointed out to her that the Chinese legal system was &quot;faster&quot; than the French one. She was immediately reminded by her opponents at home that the Chinese system orders 10,000 executions each year, and that defence lawyers there must be authorised by the Communist Party. She however brought up with her hosts the fate of three Chinese journalists recently imprisoned, and criticised the &quot;meekness&quot; of French entrepreneurs in tackling new markets such as China. Royal was criticised by French and international media by what was called &quot;mangling the French language&quot; in a soundbite delivered on the Great Wall of China. She used the word &quot;bravitude&quot; instead of the word &quot;bravoure&quot;, which means &quot;bravery&quot;.

====Canada: Support for the Quebec independence movement====
In January 2007, during a meeting with Quebec opposition leader and Parti Québécois head André Boisclair, she declared her support for the Quebec sovereignty movement in its aim to secede from Canada. Royal said Quebec and France share common values, including &quot;sovereignty and Quebec&#x27;s freedom&quot;. Soon after, Royal took a phone call from comedian Gérald Dahan pretending to be Quebec Premier Jean Charest, and was tricked into making a quip about Corsica&#x27;s independence: &quot;Not all French people would be opposed.&quot; She then added, &quot;But don&#x27;t repeat that or we&#x27;ll have another scandal on our hands.&quot;

====On Afghanistan====
On 5 April 2007, when commenting on the kidnapping of two Frenchmen by the Taliban in Afghanistan, Royal called for sanctions to be imposed by the United Nations against regimes like the Taliban. This comment was widely interpreted as indicating that Royal did not understand that the Taliban no longer formed the Afghan government and that she was clueless on international matters.

====Ukraine: Russian support====
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Royal repeatedly supported the Russian view that NATO was to blame for the war, and falsely claimed that the Mariupol hospital airstrike and the Bucha massacre never happened. According to her, the events were &quot;war propaganda&quot; promoted by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to interrupt the peace process. Royal&#x27;s claims were condemned by Olivier Faure, the leader of Royal&#x27;s Socialist Party, and Raphaël Glucksmann, its leader in the European Parliament.

==== Hijacking &#x27;Africa-led&#x27; clean energy scheme ====
On 30 April 2017, Youba Sokona resigned from the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative, citing “European interference [to impose EU-preferred projects] in African governance that belongs to another era.” Reports surfaced directly accusing Ségolène Royal of undermining African leadership. The initiative was scrapped in 2017.

==Personal life==
From the late 1970s, Royal was the partner of François Hollande, later to become President of France, whom she met at ENA. The couple had four children. They were neither married (considering it too &quot;bourgeois&quot;) nor bound by a PACS (pacte civil de solidarité, which provides for a civil union between two adults, regardless of gender), contrary to rumours. A news agency leaked news of their separation in June 2007, on the evening of the legislative election. According to the &quot;Guardian&quot;, she had asked Hollande &quot;to move out of the house&quot; and pursue his new love interest &quot;which has been detailed in books and newspapers&quot; – a reference to a much-discussed chapter by journalists explaining how Hollande was having a long-term affair with a journalist.

Royal&#x27;s eldest son, Thomas Hollande, served as an adviser to her during her presidential candidacy, working on a website designed to appeal to young voters.

Her brother Antoine named their brother Gérard Royal as the agent who placed the bomb that sank the Greenpeace ship &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;. But other sources claim that this statement is exaggerated and that Gérard was part of the logistics team.

Royal&#x27;s cousin Anne-Christine Royal followed the paternal side of the family and has been a candidate of the far-right Front National party at a local election in Bordeaux.

Royal was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013.

<text>A prefect (, plural , both ) in France is the State&#x27;s representative in a department or region. Regional prefects are &quot;ex officio&quot; the departmental prefects of the regional prefecture. Prefects are tasked with upholding the law in the department they serve in, including controlling the actions of local authorities. Prefects are appointed by decree by the President of France when presiding over the government&#x27;s Council of Ministers, following a proposal by the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior. They serve at the government&#x27;s discretion and can be replaced at any meeting of the Council of Ministers.

To uphold the law, they are authorised to undertake a wide variety of actions, such as coordinating police forces, enforcing immigration rules, controlling authorities&#x27; finances, as well as suing local collectivities in the name of the State. The prefects in Lille, Rennes, Bordeaux, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg each have additional tasks as heads of their regional defence and security zone (&quot;zone de défense et de sécurité&quot;). In the Paris area, the prefect of police is the head of the local zone. Overseas France has a similar zones system.

Subprefects () are responsible for the subdivisions of departments, known as arrondissements, when the arrondissement is not that of the prefecture. The office of a prefect is known as a prefecture and that of a subprefect a subprefecture. From 1982 to 1988, under the Socialist administration of President François Mitterrand, prefects were called &quot;commissaires de la République&quot; (the Republic&#x27;s commissioners) and subprefects &quot;commissaires adjoints de la République&quot; (the Republic&#x27;s deputy commissioners).

==Roles==

The post of prefect was first created on 17 February 1800 by then-First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte.

Their roles were initially similar to those of the pre-revolutionary intendants. Prefects were initially charged with supervising local governments in their department, ensuring that taxes flowed to Paris and supervising conscription at the local level.

Currently, the main role of the prefect is defined in article 72 of the Constitution of France:

The exact role and attributions are defined in decrees, most notably decrees of 1964, 1982, 2004, each replacing the preceding one.

The prefect of the &quot;département&quot; containing the &quot;chef-lieu de région&quot; is also the &quot;préfet de région&quot;, or the prefect of the &quot;région&quot;.

Prefects operate under the Minister of the Interior. Their main missions include:
* representing the State to local governments;
* security
** the coordination of police and gendarmerie forces;
** handling major crises;
** emergency defence procedures;
* safety
** the decision to evacuate zones facing natural disasters; the organisation of relief operations;
* responsibility for official documents, such as
** the production of identity documents, including identity cards and passports;
** the issuing of driving licences, and their administrative withdrawal in case of certain offences;
** the application of immigration rules;
*ensuring respect for legality: officials working for the prefect verify the legality of decisions made by local governments and submit doubtful cases to administrative courts or to financial auditing courts.
Prefects may issue administrative orders in areas falling within the competency of the national government, including general safety. For instance, they may prohibit the use of certain roads without special tyres in times of snow. The prohibition on smoking or leaving the motor running while filling the fuel tank of a motor vehicle is another example of a matter typically decided by a prefectoral administrative order.

On official occasions, prefects wear uniforms.

For much of the time after 1800, the departments largely functioned as transmission belts for policies developed in Paris. As such, prefects originally had fairly extensive powers of supervision and control over departmental affairs. This was especially true during the Consulate and the First and Second Empires, when even the most trivial local matter had to be referred to the prefect. Since 1982, local government has been progressively decentralized, and the prefect&#x27;s role has largely been limited to preventing local policies from conflicting with national policy.

==Special cases==
* In New Caledonia and French Polynesia, the prefect&#x27;s roles, with certain differences in status, are fulfilled by a high commissioner; in Wallis and Futuna, by a superior administrator.
* The French Southern and Antarctic Lands used to be run by a superior administrator, but since 2004 are run by a prefect. The prefect, however, is not based in the territories, but in Réunion.
* Paris, which is both a municipality (&quot;commune&quot;) and a department, is an exception. While it has a prefect, who is also prefect of the Île-de-France region, another prefect handles law enforcement in Paris and some surrounding areas, as well many other administrative duties: the Prefect of Police of Paris. In Paris, the law enforcement powers exercised in other French cities and towns by the mayor belong to the Prefect of Police. In 2012, a Prefecture of Police of Bouches-du-Rhône was also created, seated at Marseille, with similar powers.
* The authority of the State over the sea is exercised by the maritime prefect of the relevant region.

<text>Sydney Biddle Barrows (born January 14, 1952) is an American businesswoman and socialite who became known as an escort agency owner under the name Sheila Devin; she later became known as &quot;The Mayflower Madam&quot;. She has since become a management consultant and writer.

In October 1984, her escort service was disbanded, and after pleading guilty and being fined $5,000 for promoting prostitution, she wrote a 1986 autobiography, &quot;Mayflower Madam: The Secret Life of Sydney Biddle Barrows&quot;. A TV movie based on the book starring Candice Bergen was broadcast in 1987 under the title &quot;Mayflower Madam&quot;.

==Early life, education and career==
Barrows comes from the Biddle family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and is descended from &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers William Brewster, John Howland, Elizabeth Tilley, and Thomas Rogers. Her father is Donald Byers Barrows, Jr. (born 1926) of Rumson, New Jersey, and her mother is Jeannette Ballantine, who is now married to Felix Molzer, a musician and director of the Monmouth Arts Center, New Jersey.

Barrows attended Stoneleigh-Burnham, a girls&#x27; boarding school in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and is an alumna of the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York City. She worked in 1975 as an assistant to Alan Snyder, the buyer for Abraham &amp; Straus. She was introduced to high-class prostitution and started her own escort service named Cachet, which existed in New York City from 1979 to 1984. Some of its clients included industrialists, high-powered business executives, lawyers, foreign diplomats and Arabian oil sheiks.

In October 1984, Cachet was shut down, Barrows was arrested, and the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s Office charged her with promoting prostitution. When arrested at her home office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Barrows identified herself as Sheila Devin; one report describes her as the CEO.

The name &quot;Mayflower Madam&quot; was coined by a &quot;New York Post&quot; reporter, Peter Fearon, who broke the story of Barrows&#x27;s Mayflower connections. After her guilty plea, Barrows published a best-selling autobiography, &quot;Mayflower Madam: The Secret Life of Sydney Biddle Barrows&quot; (1986). Barrows appeared in 1987 on the late-night television series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with a parody of her book; the sketch included Candice Bergen, who portrayed Barrows in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Mayflower Madam&quot; (1987). Barrows subsequently wrote two books on sexual etiquette.

In late 2008, Barrows finished &quot;Uncensored Sales Strategies: A Radical New Approach to Selling Your Customers What They Really Want—No Matter What Business You&#x27;re In&quot;, co-authored with marketing expert Dan Kennedy. Since the mid-late 1990s, Barrows has run a consulting business with a focus on customer service and experience.

==Personal life==
Barrows was divorced from the late Darnay Hoffman, a high-profile lawyer.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="563998" wikidata="Q78767" url="?curid=563998" title="Ernst Haas">
<text>Ernst Haas (March 2, 1921 – September 12, 1986) was an Austrian-American photojournalist and color photographer. During his 40-year career Haas trod the line between photojournalism and art photography. In addition to his coverage of events around the globe after World War II Haas was an early innovator in color photography. His images were carried by magazines like &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; and, in 1962, were the subject of the first single-artist exhibition of color photography at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. He served as president of the cooperative Magnum Photos. His book of volcano photographs, &quot;The Creation&quot; (1971), remains one of the most successful photography books ever published, selling more than 350,000 copies.

== Early life and education ==
Haas was born in Vienna, Austria, on March 2, 1921. He was the son of Ernst Haas, a high-level civil servant, and Frederike Haas-Zipser. He had an older brother named Fritz Haas. 

Haas was raised in the cultural climate of Vienna before World War II. His parents, who placed great value upon education and the arts, encouraged his creative pursuits from an early age. His father enjoyed music and photography, and his mother wrote poetry and aspired to be an artist. Haas&#x27;s teachers had him act as a judge, rather than a participant, in artistic competitions among his peers. As a painter, he had particular interest in an artwork&#x27;s formal qualities, and developed a refined sense of composition and perspective.

From 1935 to 1938, Haas attended LEH Grinzing, a private school in Vienna, where he studied art, literature, poetry, philosophy, and science. His formal education was interrupted in 1938, when the school was closed following Germany&#x27;s invasion of Austria. The following year, Haas received his diploma from Rainer Gymnasium.

Haas was sent to a German army labor camp, working six hours a day in exchange for two daily hours of school attendance. He left the service in 1940 and returned to Vienna to study medicine. Haas was only able to complete one year of medical school before he was forced out as a result of his Jewish ancestry.

== Introduction to photography ==
Haas was uninterested in learning photography as a child, though his father tried to encourage him. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1940, Haas first entered the darkroom, learning to print old family negatives. His interest grew, and he soon began to take his own photographs.

Though his formal education was complicated by the war, Haas was an autodidact and worked to learn the medium. In 1941, as the “school photographer” of the Max Reinhardt Film Seminar, he attended technical classes and developed an interest in filmmaking. Haas also took advantage of his family&#x27;s extensive library, as well as museums and libraries in Vienna. He studied philosophy and poetry, in particular, both of which informed his beliefs about the creative potential for photography.

&quot;A Poet’s Camera&quot; selection of photography by Bryan Holme (1946), which combined poetry with metaphoric imagery by artists like Edward Weston, was particularly important to Haas&#x27;s early development. Many of his first extant photographs—close-ups of plants, water, and natural forms—reflect its influence.

Unsure of his career path, Haas realized that photography could provide both a means of support and a vehicle for communicating his ideas. He obtained his first camera in 1946, at the age of 25, trading a 20-pound block of margarine for a Rolleiflex on the Vienna black market. Of the decision, he later said:

In 1947 Haas presented his first exhibition at the American Red Cross in Vienna, where he had a part-time position teaching photography to soldiers. Taking a portfolio of his work to Zurich, he drew the interest of Arnold Kübler, the first editor in chief of the magazine &quot;Du&quot;. After reviewing his photographs, Kübler introduced Haas to Swiss photographer Werner Bischof’s images of Berlin after the war. Influenced by Bischof&#x27;s work, Haas began to consider how an image could simultaneously tell a story and function as an autonomous work of art. When Haas returned home, he similarly documented the war’s effects in Vienna.

Haas obtained assignments from magazines like &quot;Heute&quot;, often working with fellow correspondent Inge Morath. In 1947, while scouting locations for a fashion shoot, Haas and Morath witnessed prisoners of war disembarking a train and began documenting their arrival. Haas’s images show the anticipation and grief of people searching for their lost relatives among the survivors. The resulting photo essay, “Homecoming,” was published in both &quot;Heute&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

Warren Trabant showed Robert Capa, the war photographer, Haas&#x27;s “Homecoming” photographs before they were published. Upon reviewing his work, Capa invited Haas to travel to Paris and join the international photographic cooperative Magnum Photos, then two years old. Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger, David “Chim” Seymour, Werner Bischof, and William Vandivert were already members.

At the same time, Haas was offered a staff photographer position at &quot;Life&quot;. He decided he did not want to be limited by &quot;Life&quot;’s restrictive scope. Describing his decision in a letter to &quot;Life&quot; editor Wilson Hicks, Haas wrote “What I want is to stay free, so that I can carry out my ideas... I don’t think there are many editors who could give me the assignments I give myself...”

== United States ==
After carrying out assignments in Vienna and London, Haas conceived an extensive project about America. Visas to the United States were difficult to obtain, but in 1950 Robert Capa appointed him Magnum&#x27;s U.S. vice president. With this position, Haas was able to obtain the proper documentation, and he arrived in New York in May of that year. The first images Haas took in the United States showed fellow immigrants arriving at Ellis Island.

By the time of Haas&#x27;s arrival, the streets of New York had already become a popular subject for photographers who sought to document all aspects of life. His approach was less direct and confrontational than that of colleagues such as Lisette Model and William Klein. Wrote critic A.D. Coleman, “[Haas] was a lyric poet pursuing a photographic equivalent of gestural drawing, utilizing such photographic effects as softness of focus, selective depth of field, and overexposure to telling effect.”

While Haas would continue traveling for his work, he lived the rest of his life in New York City.

== Assignments for &quot;Life&quot; magazine ==
In 1952 Haas hitchhiked across the United States to White Sands National Monument in New Mexico, planning to photograph Native Americans. Working with the vast area&#x27;s changing light and clouds, Haas also photographed symbols, local details, and tourist oddities. His finished photo essay, published by &quot;Life&quot; as “Land of Enchantment” in a six-page spread, was well received by readers and prompted the magazine to initiate another project. According to writer (and early Magnum employee) Inge Bondi, Haas’ Western chronicle was the first major story he created based on his own instinct and at his own financial risk.

Once back in New York, Haas purchased color film to begin a new project. He had experimented with color as early as 1949, but this would be his first opportunity to work with what was still a scarce and expensive medium. Haas spent two months photographing New York, and in 1953 &quot;Life&quot; published his vivid images. Titled “Images of a Magic City,” the sprawling 24-page story spanned two issues. According to critic Andy Grundberg, these images “brought photography into the precincts of abstract expressionism.”

== Technique and innovations in color photography ==
Though Haas continued to use black-and-white film for much of his career, color film and visual experimentalism became integral to his photography. He frequently employed techniques like shallow depth of field, selective focus, and blurred motion to create evocative, metaphorical works. When he submitted his blurred motion bullfight photos, original at the time, to the lab they said there was a problem and they were unusable. &quot;Life&quot; ran a 12-page spread. He became interested in, as he put it, &quot;transforming an object from what it is to what you want it to be.&quot; Beyond the physical place, person, or object he depicted, Haas hoped to reflect the joy of looking and of human experience.

Haas supported his adventurous personal work with commercially viable photojournalism, advertising, and motion picture stills photography. While on such assignments, he would make his own photographs, translating his passion for poetry, music, painting, and adventure into color imagery. His reputation on the rise, Haas traveled the world, photographing the U.S., Europe, South Africa, and Southeast Asia in expressionistic color.

In the late 1940s, Haas switched from his medium format Rolleiflex to the smaller 35mm Leica rangefinder camera, which he used consistently for the rest of his career. Once he began working in color, he most often used Kodachrome, known for its rich, saturated colors. To print his color work, Haas used the dye transfer process whenever possible. An expensive, complex process most frequently used at the time for advertising, dye transfer allowed for great control over color hue and saturation.

As the technology of color photography evolved and improved during this period, audience interest in color imagery increased. Many of the magazines that published Haas’ work, such as &quot;Life&quot;, improved the quality of their color reproduction, and increasingly sought to include his work in the medium. Despite this progress, many photographers, curators, and historians were initially reluctant to consider color photography as art, given the technology&#x27;s commercial origins.

== Leadership of Magnum ==

In 1954 Robert Capa, Magnum&#x27;s first president, was killed while on assignment covering the First Indochina War. That same year, Werner Bischof died in a car accident in the Andes. Following their deaths, Haas was elected to Magnum&#x27;s board of directors and traveled to Indochina himself to cover the war.

After the death of David “Chim” Seymour in Suez in 1959, Haas was named the fourth president of Magnum. He made significant and lasting contributions to the organization as its leader. Haas had a deep understanding of the cooperative&#x27;s mission and encouraged its members to strive for excellence and innovation. In a letter to the members of Magnum, he wrote:

== Exhibitions ==
In 1962 the Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a ten-year survey of Haas&#x27;s color photography. Titled &quot;Ernst Haas: Color Photography&quot;, the exhibition marked MoMA&#x27;s first solo-artist retrospective exhibition dedicated to color work, and took place during Edward Steichen’s final year as director of the museum&#x27;s Department of Photography. It was realized by Steichen’s successor John Szarkowski, and consisted of about 80 prints including Haas’s motion studies and color essays. Of Haas’ revelatory color imagery, Steichen has said, “He is a free spirit, untrammelled by tradition and theory, who has gone out and found beauty unparalleled in photography.” No exhibition catalogue was produced at the time, but the original prints exist, allowing a much later &quot;re-creation&quot; of the exhibition.

Before his solo exhibition at MoMA, Haas had been included in Steichen&#x27;s exhibition &quot;The Family of Man&quot;, which premiered in 1955 and traveled to 38 countries.

== Advertising and stills photography ==
Haas was a respected stills photographer for many films, including &quot;The Misfits&quot;, &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. John Huston employed Haas as a second-unit director for his 1966 film &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Bible&quot;), to visualize the section devoted to creation.

In addition to editorial journalism and unit stills work, Haas was also highly regarded for advertising photography, contributing groundbreaking campaigns for Volkswagen automobiles and Marlboro cigarettes, among other clients.

== &quot;The Creation&quot; and other publications ==

Haas was inspired and fascinated by the natural world, and took photographs of the elements throughout his career. Inspired in part by his involvement in John Huston&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;The Bible&quot;, Haas conceived an ambitious, multi-year project to visualize the theme of the Earth&#x27;s creation, as described in a variety of religious texts, primarily the Old Testament. His book &quot;The Creation&quot;, first published in 1971, presented 106 color photographs made throughout the world, organized into an expressive, poetic sequence. The book was produced in multiple editions in numerous languages through 1988, selling over 350,000 copies to become one of the best-selling photography books of all time.

Haas also issued the monographs &quot;In America&quot; (1975), &quot;In Germany&quot; (1977), and &quot;Himalayan Pilgrimage&quot; (1978).

In 1980 Haas published a limited edition portfolio of dye transfer prints from &quot;The Creation&quot; with Daniel Wolf Press. He also began work on a book devoted to Japan and a project illustrating the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke, whose writings inspired him throughout his life.

Posthumous books of Haas’ photographs include: &quot;Ernst Haas: Color Photographs&quot; (1989); &quot;Ernst Haas in Black and White&quot; (1992); &quot;Ernst Haas&quot; (Photo Poche), 2010; and &quot;Ernst Haas: Color Correction&quot; (2011).

== Television appearances and teaching ==
In 1962, the year of his retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, Haas was invited to write and host &quot;The Art of Seeing&quot;, a four-hour miniseries for National Public Television, then in its first year. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine praised its success as a television program, for Haas combined seeing with hearing. Throughout the series, Haas demonstrated what makes a successful photograph, illustrating how images can be transformed by the slightest variations of technique, perspective, or choice of tools and materials.

Haas also taught frequently at photography workshops, including the Maine Photographic Workshops, the Ansel Adams Workshop in Yosemite National Park, and the Anderson Ranch Arts Center near Aspen, Colorado.

== Personal life and family ==

In 1951 Haas married the Hungarian countess Antoinette Wenckheim. They later divorced, and in 1962 Haas married Cynthia Buehr Seneque, an American editor. They had two children, Alexander and Victoria.

Gisela Minke, a German-born airline stewardess, was Haas&#x27;s companion for many years. She encouraged his interest in Tibet, and their travels resulted in the book &quot;Himalayan Pilgrimage&quot;. Six years before his death, he met Takiko Kawai, who he credited with introducing him to the culture and traditions of Japan.

== Late life and death ==
In the early 1970s Haas became interested in creating audiovisual slideshows—long sequences of projected imagery with accompanying soundtracks, dissolving from one image into the next. &quot;I love music,&quot; he explained, &quot;and with my audiovisual presentation I can combine music and photography.”

After suffering a stroke in December 1985, Haas concentrated on layouts for two books he wanted to publish, one featuring his black and white photographs, the other his color. At the time of his death from a stroke on September 12, 1986, he had been preparing to write his autobiography.

== Legacy ==

In 1958, Haas was listed as one of the 10 greatest photographers in the world by &quot;Popular Photography&quot; magazine, along with Ansel Adams, Richard Avedon, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Alfred Eisenstadt, Philippe Halsman, Yousuf Karsh, Gjon Mili, Irving Penn, and W. Eugene Smith. He won the Hasselblad Award just before his death.

A number of awards have been created in Haas&#x27;s honor, including the Ernst Haas Award for Creative Photography by the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP); and the Ernst Haas Photographers Grant, funded by Kodak, at the Maine Photographic Workshops. In 1998 the Ernst Haas Studio archive was sent to London to be housed at the Hulton Getty Picture Library as part of a licensing agreement with Getty Images. In 1999 the Ernst Haas Memorial Collection was established at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine.

The Ernst Haas Estate is operated by his children, Alexander Haas and Victoria Haas.

<doc id="564000" wikidata="Q643745" url="?curid=564000" title="Askari">
<text>An askari or ascari (from Somali, Swahili, and Arabic , , meaning &#x27;soldier&#x27; or &#x27;military&#x27;, also &#x27;police&#x27; in Somali) was a local soldier serving in the armies of the European colonial powers in Africa, particularly in the African Great Lakes, Northeast Africa and Central Africa. The word is used in this sense in English, as well as in German, Italian, Urdu, and Portuguese. In French, the word is used only in reference to native troops outside the French colonial empire. The designation is still in occasional use today to informally describe police, gendarmerie and security guards.

During the period of the European colonial empires in Africa, locally recruited soldiers designated as askaris were employed by the Italian, British, Portuguese, German and Belgian colonial armies. They played a crucial role in the conquest of the various colonial possessions, and subsequently served as garrison and internal security forces. During both World Wars, askari units also served outside their colonies of origin, in various parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In South Africa the term refers to former members of the liberation movements who defected to the Apartheid government security forces.

==Etymology==
&quot;Askari&quot; is a loan word from Persian () &#x27;soldier&#x27;. The Persian word is a derivation from the Middle Persian word &#x27;army&#x27;. The word &quot;lashkar&quot; also is the root of the word &quot;lascar&quot; for a South Asian soldier or a person of South Asian origin. Words for &#x27;(regular) soldier&#x27; derived from these words are found in Azeri, Arabic, Indonesian, Malay, Somali, Swahili, Turkish, and Urdu.

==Belgian colonies==

In the Belgian Congo, the askaris were organised into a combined military and police force, which was commanded by Belgian officers and both native and white non commissioned officers.

==British colonies==

The Imperial British East Africa Company raised units of askaris from among the Swahili people, the Sudanese and Somalis. There was no official uniform, nor standardised weaponry. Many of the askaris campaigned in their native dress. Officers usually wore civilian clothes.

From 1895 the British askaris were organised into a regular, disciplined and uniformed force called the East African Rifles, later forming part of the multi-battalion King&#x27;s African Rifles. The designation of &quot;askari&quot; was retained for locally recruited troops in the King&#x27;s African Rifles, smaller military units and police forces in the colonies until the end of colonial rule in Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda during the period 1961–63. After independence, the term &quot;Askari&quot; continued to be used to refer to soldiers in former British colonies.

==German colonies==
The German Colonial Army (&quot;Schutztruppe&quot;) of the German Empire employed native troops with European officers and NCOs in its colonies. The main concentration of such locally recruited troops was in German East Africa (now Tanzania), formed in 1881 after the transfer of the &quot;Wissmanntruppe&quot; (raised in 1889 to suppress the Abushiri Revolt) to German imperial control.

The first askaris formed in German East Africa were raised by DOAG (&quot;Deutsche Ost-Afrika Gesellschaft&quot;—the German East Africa Company) in about 1888. Originally drawn from Sudanese mercenaries, the German askaris were subsequently recruited from the Wahehe and Angoni tribal groups. They were harshly disciplined but well paid and highly trained by German cadres who were themselves subject to a rigorous selection process. Prior to 1914 the basic &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; unit in Southeast Africa was the &quot;Feldkompanie&quot; comprising seven or eight German officers and NCOs with between 150 and 200 askaris (usually 160)—including two machine gun teams.

Such small independent commands were often supplemented by tribal irregulars or &quot;Ruga-Ruga&quot;.

They were successfully used in German East Africa where 11,000 askaris, porters and their European officers, commanded by Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, managed to fight a successful guerilla campaign against numerically superior British, Portuguese and Belgian colonial forces until the end of World War I in 1918.

The Weimar Republic and pre-war Nazi Germany provided pension payments to the German askaris. Due to interruptions during the worldwide depression and World War II, the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) voted in 1964 to fund the back pay of the askaris still alive. The West German embassy at Dar es Salaam identified approximately 350 ex-askaris and set up a temporary cashiers office at Mwanza on Lake Victoria.

Only a few claimants could produce the certificates given to them in 1918; others provided pieces of their old uniforms as proof of service. The banker who had brought the money came up with an idea: each claimant was handed a broom and ordered in German to perform the manual of arms. Not one of them failed the test.

==Italian colonies==
The Italian army in Italian East Africa recruited Eritrean and subsequently Somali troops to serve with Italian officers and some NCOs. These forces comprised infantry, cavalry, camel-mounted and light artillery units. Somali personnel were later recruited to serve with Royal Italian Navy ships operating in the Indian Ocean. The Italian askaris (&quot;ascari&quot;) fought in the Mahdist War, Battle of Coatit, First Italo–Ethiopian War, Italian-Turkish War, Second Italo-Abyssinian War and in the World War II East African Campaign.

===History===
Many of the Askaris in Eritrea were drawn from local Nilotic populations, including Hamid Idris Awate, who reputedly had some Nara ancestry.

The first Eritrean battalions, the I, II, III and IV, were raised in 1888 from Muslim and Christian volunteers, replacing an earlier Bashi-bazouk corps of irregulars. The four &quot;Indigeni&quot; battalions in existence by 1891 were incorporated into the Royal Corps of Colonial Troops that year. The original four were expanded to eight battalions, adding V, VI, VII and VIII, in 1895/9. The Eritrean ascaris fought with distinction at Serobeti, Agordat, Kassala, Coatit and Adwa and subsequently served in Libya and Ethiopia.

Out of a total of 256,000 Italian troops serving in Italian East Africa in 1940, about 182,000 were recruited from Eritrea, Somalia and the recently occupied (1935–36) Ethiopia. When in January 1941, Allied forces invaded Ethiopia in January 1941, most of the locally recruited ascaris deserted. The majority of the Eritrean Ascaris remained loyal until the Italian surrender four months later.

===Organisation===
Initially the Eritrean Ascaris comprised only infantry battalions, although Eritrean cavalry squadrons (&quot;Penne di Falco&quot;) and mountain artillery batteries were subsequently raised. By 1922 units of camel cavalry called &quot;meharisti&quot; had been added. Those Eritrean camel units were also deployed in Libya after 1932. During the 1930s Benito Mussolini added some armored cars units to the Ascari.

===Uniforms===
Eritrean regiments in Italian service wore high red fezzes with coloured tufts and waist sashes that varied according to each unit. As examples, the 17th Eritrean Battalion had black and white tufts and vertically striped sashes; while the 64th Eritrean Battalion wore both of these items in scarlet and purple.

White uniforms were worn for parade (see illustration) with khaki for other duties. The Somali ascari were similarly dressed, though with knee length shorts.

===Ranks===
The Eritrean and Somali Ascari had the following ranks, from simple soldier to senior non commissioned officer: &quot;Ascari&quot; - &quot;Muntaz (corporal)&quot; - &quot;Bulukbasci (lance-sergeant)&quot; -&quot;Sciumbasci (sergeant)&quot;. The Sciumbasci-capos (staff-sergeants) were the senior Eritrean non-commissioned officers, chosen in part according to their performance in battle.

All commissioned officers of the Eritrean Ascari were Italian.

==Spanish colonies==

As noted above &quot;askari&quot; was normally a designation used in Sub-Saharan Africa. Exceptionally though, the term &quot;askari&quot; was also used by the Spanish colonial government in North-West Africa, in respect not of their regular Moroccan troops (see regulares), but of a locally recruited gendarmerie force raised in Spanish Morocco in 1913. They were known as the &quot;Mehal-la Jalifianas&quot;. This was the equivalent of the better known Goumiers employed in French Morocco.

Indigenous members of the Tropas Nómadas or desert police serving in the Spanish Sahara were also designated as &quot;askaris&quot;, as were the other ranks of the Native Police (&quot;Policia Indígena&quot;) raised in Melilla in 1909.

==Portuguese colonies==
In Portuguese West Africa, and most other African colonies of the Portuguese Empire, local askaris were recruited. These were used to keep the peace in the nation-sized colonies. During the 20th century, all the indigenous troops were merged into a Portuguese colonial army. This military was segregated along lines of race, and until 1960 there were three classes of soldiers: commissioned soldiers (European whites), overseas soldiers (black African &quot;civilizados&quot;) and native soldiers (Africans who lived in the Portuguese colonies). These categories were renamed to 1st, 2nd and 3rd class in 1960—which effectively corresponded to the same classification.

==Apartheid South Africa==

During Apartheid, especially during the 1980s, Askari was the term used to describe former members of the liberation movements who came to work for the Security Branch, providing information, identifying and tracing former comrades. A number were also operationally deployed. Former members of the liberation movements became askaris if they defected from the liberation movements of their own accord or if they were arrested or captured. In some cases, attempts were made to &#x27;turn&#x27; captured uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) or Azanian People&#x27;s Liberation Army (APLA) operatives using both orthodox and unorthodox methods during interrogation, often involving torture. Other askaris were MK operatives who had been abducted by the Security Branch from neighbouring states. Several abductees remain disappeared and are believed to have been killed. The threats of death used to &#x27;turn&#x27; askaris were not idle. During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, amnesty applications revealed that several operatives were killed for steadfastly refusing to co-operate.

Askaris were primarily used to infiltrate groups and to identify former comrades with whom they had trained in other countries. At the Pretoria hearing in July 1999, Mr Chris Mosiane testified: &quot;In the initial stages askaris were used as police dogs to sniff out insurgents with white SB [Security Branch members] as their handlers. Black SB were used to monitor the askaris.&quot;
Askaris were initially treated as informers and were paid from a secret fund. Later, they were integrated into the South African Police at the level of constable and were paid an SAP salary. While deployed in the regions, they were paid an additional amount, which was usually generated by making false claims to a secret fund. After successful operations they usually received bonuses. 
The askaris used Vlakplaas as an operational base and resided in the townships where they attempted to maintain their cover as underground MK operatives. Although a few askaris escaped, most were far too frightened to attempt it. At his amnesty hearing, Colonel Eugene de Kock testified that he had set up a spy network amongst the askaris and used electronic surveillance. He told the Amnesty Committee that he had also established a disciplinary structure to deal with internal issues and other infractions by askaris and white officers. However, askaris who exceeded their authority in operational situations or criminal matters were seldom punished.
Generally askaris were extremely effective. Because of their internal experience of MK structures, they were invaluable in identifying potential suspects, in infiltrating networks, in interrogations and in giving evidence for the state in trials.

==Post 2003 Iraq War ==

Widely deployed Ugandan private security guards are also designated as askari. Guards were to receive $1,000 monthly salary and an $80,000 bonus if shot, but many have complained that the money was not paid or unfair fees assessed. The guards work for recruiting agencies such as Askar Security Services, which are hired by Beowulf International, a receiving company in Iraq, which subcontracts their services to EOD Technologies, an American company hired by the U.S. Department of Defense to provide security guards for Camp Victory in Baghdad. A Beowulf representative said that 400 of the workers &quot;had impressed the US Army with their skill and experience&quot;, but complained that some of the workers lacked police or security experience and &quot;didn&#x27;t even know how to hold a gun&quot;. At least eleven other Ugandan recruiters include Dresak International and Connect Financial Services.

<doc id="564002" wikidata="Q6038" url="?curid=564002" title="Mentawai Islands Regency">
<text>The Mentawai Islands Regency is a regency of West Sumatra Province which consists of a chain of about a hundred islands and islets approximately off the western coast of Sumatra in Indonesia. They cover a land area of and had a population of 76,173 at the 2010 Census and 87,623 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 95,068.

Siberut at is the largest of the islands, occupying 64.27% of the land area of the regency. The other major islands are Sipura (or &quot;Sipora&quot;), North Pagai (&quot;Pagai Utara&quot;), and South Pagai (&quot;Pagai Selatan&quot;). The islands lie off the Sumatran coast, across the Mentawai Strait. The indigenous inhabitants of the islands are known as the Mentawai people. The Mentawai Islands have become a noted destination for surfing, with over 40 boats offering surf charters to international guests.

== Administrative districts ==

The Mentawai Islands have been administered as a regency within the West Sumatra (&quot;Sumatera Barat&quot;) province since 1999. The regency seat is Tua Pejat, on the island of Sipora. Padang, the capital of the province, lies on the Sumatran mainland opposite Siberut. The regency is divided into ten districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below from south to north with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid-2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of villages (all classed as rural &quot;desa&quot;) and the number of named offshore islands in each district, and its postcode.

Note: (a) Sikakap District covers the northern part of South Pagai Island and the southern part of North Pagai Island, plus some intervening small islands. Of the three &quot;desa&quot;, Matobek is entirely on North Pagai Island, while Sikakap and Taikato are mainly on North Pagai Island but each includes areas on South Pagai as well as the intervening small islands.

===Villages===
The ten districts comprise forty-three rural villages (&quot;desa&quot;) listed below with their areas and their populations as officially estimated for mid 2023:

== Tourism ==
===Surfing===
Macaronis was first discovered in 1980 by pioneer surf discoverers Chris Goodnow, Scott Wakefield, and Tony Fitzpatrick, who originally named the break ‘P-Land’ on their first visit (after Pasangan Bay / Pagai Islands). Amazingly, and considering the remote location, P-Land may have been the first wave surfed in the Mentawai Islands. Lances Right was discovered a full 10 years later, while Chris, Scott, and Tony continued to keep their discovery a secret. They returned in 1981 with friend Tim Annand, and again on a boat trip in the 90’s.

The first photos of the surf breaks in the Mentawais area were leaked after a surf trip in 1992 aboard the MV Indies Trader, with professional surfers Ross Clarke-Jones, Tom Carroll, and Martin Potter. Ever since then, the Mentawai Islands have been well on the radar of surf travellers around the world. At the West of Sumatra, the Mentawai Islands have the most consistent surf breaks in Indonesia making it one of the preferred choices for serious surfers. The tropical waters surrounding the islands offer year-round waves up to .

== Ecology ==

The islands have been separated from Sumatra since the mid-Pleistocene period, which has allowed at least twenty endemic species to develop amongst its flora and fauna. This includes six endemic primates: the Kloss&#x27;s gibbon (&quot;Hylobates klossii&quot;), Mentawai macaque (&quot;Macaca pagensis&quot;), Siberut macaque (&quot;Macaca siberu&quot;), Mentawai langur (&quot;Presbytis potenziani&quot;), Siberut langur (&quot;Presbytis siberu&quot;), and pig-tailed langur (&quot;Simias concolor&quot;). They are highly endangered due to logging, unsustainable hunting, and conversion of rainforest to palm oil plantations. Some areas of the Mentawai Islands rainforest ecoregion are protected, such as the Siberut National Park. Red junglefowl, the Asian palm civet, and crab-eating macaque are also native.

== Seismic activity ==
The Mentawai Islands lie above the Sunda megathrust, a seismically active zone responsible for many great earthquakes. This megathrust runs along the southwestern side of Sumatra island, forming the interface between the Eurasian Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate.

Earthquake and tsunami activity has been high since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In 1833, the region was hit with an earthquake, possibly similar in size to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake; another large earthquake struck in 1797. On October 25, 2010, an earthquake in southern Sumatra led to a deadly tsunami that devastated villages in South and North Pagai. On March 3, 2016, an earthquake of 7.8 magnitudes occurred off the Indian Ocean, a few hundred kilometres from Mentawai islands, as a result of strike-slip faulting within the oceanic lithosphere of the Indo-Australia plate.

<doc id="564003" wikidata="Q2812895" url="?curid=564003" title="Alasdair Milne">
<text>Alasdair David Gordon Milne (8 October 19308 January 2013) was a British television producer and executive. He had a long career at the BBC, where he was eventually promoted to Director-General, and was described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;one of the most original and talented programme-makers to emerge during television&#x27;s formative years&quot;.

In his early career, Milne was a BBC producer and was involved in founding the current affairs series &quot;Tonight&quot; in 1957. Later, after a period outside the BBC, he became controller of BBC Scotland and BBC Television&#x27;s director of programmes. He served as Director-General of the BBC between July 1982 and January 1987, when he was forced to resign from his post by the BBC Governors following several difficult years for the BBC, which included sustained pressure from the Thatcher government about editorial decisions which had proved controversial.

==Early life==
Milne was born in British India to Charles Gordon Shaw Milne, an Aberdonian surgeon, and his wife, Edith Reid (), the daughter of a headmaster of George Heriot&#x27;s School. He would spend the first six years living with his maternal grandparents in Morningside, Edinburgh, until his father returned and they moved to Kent. He would go onto to study at Winchester College and New College, Oxford.

==Career==
For his national service Milne was commissioned into the Gordon Highlanders, before receiving a medical discharge due to a lung infection. He joined the BBC in September 1954 as a graduate trainee after his wife spotted a BBC advertisement. He was taken under the wing of Grace Wyndham Goldie who recruited, trained, guided and encouraged many well-known BBC broadcasters and current affairs executives. Milne was one of the so-called &quot;Goldie Boys&quot;, a group of producers and presenters, which included Huw Wheldon, Robin Day, David Frost, Cliff Michelmore, Ian Trethowan and Richard Dimbleby.

Milne was the first television producer to become Director-General. His background was in current affairs and he was a founder producer of &quot;Tonight&quot;, and became the programme&#x27;s editor in 1961. He also worked on programmes such as &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, one of the most controversial programmes of the 1960s, and &quot;The Great War&quot;. He was instrumental in bringing the entire Shakespeare canon to television, as well as one of the BBC&#x27;s most acute comedies, &quot;Yes Minister&quot;. He would also set up BBC Scotland, when as the appointed controller in January 1968, he decided to change the lettering on the front of the building from &#x27;BBC&#x27; to &#x27;BBC Scotland&#x27;. According to &quot;The Herald&quot;:&quot;He campaigned for BBC Scotland to make programmes reflecting Scottish values and culture, believing in its obligation to support the Gaelic language&quot;Landmark broadcasting events during his time as Director-General included Live Aid, the massive music event precipitated by a BBC news report on famine in Africa. The BBC&#x27;s new &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; programme went on air on 17 January 1983, presented by Frank Bough and former ITN newscaster Selina Scott. Milne was full of praise for the show, saying: &quot;It was a terrific start. The first &quot;Tonight&quot; programme was not as good as this.&quot;

As Director-General, Milne was involved with a series of controversies with the British government. Contentious programme-making included the &quot;Nationwide&quot; general election special with Margaret Thatcher in 1983, the coverage of the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85, the &quot;Panorama&quot; libel action, the reporting of the U.S. bombing of Libya and the controversy surrounding the programme &quot;&quot;Secret Society&quot;&quot; which took place in light of MI5&#x27;s vetting of BBC employees.

On top of this, Milne had to defend the existence of the BBC to the Peacock Committee, which was considering the future of the BBC. Milne defended the television licence thus:

The licence fee survived the negotiations, and the BBC made an expensive and failed attempt to enter satellite broadcasting.

== Resignation ==
In September 1986, Marmaduke Hussey was appointed chairman of the BBC Governors. Perceived as being Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;hatchet man&quot;, he was accused of having been appointed because of her perception that the corporation was biased towards the left. In an unprecedented step, Hussey convinced the Board of Governors that a change of direction was needed, and they forced Milne&#x27;s resignation.

Milne wrote:
Milne, who later described the governors as a &quot;bunch of amateurs&quot;, resigned in January 1987. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 30 January 1987, &quot;Mr. Milne, who became director general in 1982, resigned during a meeting of the board of governors and left without issuing a statement. The BBC said his deputy, Michael Checkland, had taken over temporarily.&quot;

==Post-resignation comments about the BBC==
Milne was strongly critical of later BBC Director-General John Birt whom he called &quot;blue skies Birt&quot;. Milne described Birt&#x27;s thesis on television&#x27;s so-called &#x27;bias against understanding&#x27; as &quot;balls, actually&quot;, and said: 

In October 2004, stories were published implying that he had suggested that alleged dumbing down of the BBC was partly the consequence of the corporation&#x27;s growing number of female executives: Milne later clarified his position: In 2006, at a private gathering at the Royal Television Society, Milne, when asked about Marmaduke Hussey, who fired him, said: &quot;What can I say about Hussey? Not a lot.&quot; In his own career he was proudest of programmes such as &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; and the historical series &quot;The Great War&quot;. He had thought he would find something else to do [after resigning in 1987] but it never happened. &quot;So I decided to go and spend the summer fishing and the winter shooting in beloved Scotland and wrap up that end of my life,&quot; he said.

==Personal life==
In 1954 Milne married Ann Ruth Sheila Eva Kirsten Graucob in Oxford. Graucob, who was of Danish and Irish ancestry, died on 1 April 1992. The couple had two sons, Ruairidh and Seumas and a daughter, Kirsty, who died in July 2013.

== Death ==
Milne died on 8 January 2013 at age 82 after suffering from a series of strokes. His obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted &quot;...Yet his term as director general ended prematurely, in January 1987, when he resigned to avoid the ignominy of being sacked. The ostensible cause was a succession of public gaffes by the BBC in 1985–86, plus a costly out-of-court libel settlement over a 1984 edition of &quot;Panorama&quot;, all of which Tory ministers, the &quot;Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and others were able to exploit.&quot; The BBC noted &quot;Milne&#x27;s time as director general was marked by clashes with Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government&quot; adding &quot;...he strongly defended the BBC&#x27;s independence and it flourished creatively, with the launch of breakfast television, &quot;Newsnight&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and the Live Aid concert broadcast.&quot;

&quot;The Independent&quot; remarked &quot;Alasdair Milne is destined to be remembered for the brutal manner of his dismissal as Director-General of the BBC in 1987, during Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s drive to purge the corporation of what she saw as its indiscipline, extravagance, irresponsibility and anti-Conservative bias.&quot; noting his contributions &quot;...In 1962 Milne and [Donald] Baverstock were involved in another ground-breaking experiment. With Ned Sherrin they created &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s first attempt at regular political satire. &quot;

Of Milne&#x27;s appointment at the BBC, &quot;Variety&quot; observed &quot;From the moment Milne was appointed as the pubcaster&#x27;s director general in 1981, he had to battle to defend its editorial independence. At the time, the UK was engaged in a war with Argentina, and government supporters felt the BBC should support the &quot;home&quot; team rather than report on the conflict from a neutral perspective.&quot;

<doc id="564004" wikidata="Q5597097" url="?curid=564004" title="Graph reduction">
<text>In computer science, graph reduction implements an efficient version of non-strict evaluation, an evaluation strategy where the arguments to a function are not immediately evaluated. This form of non-strict evaluation is also known as lazy evaluation and used in functional programming languages. The technique was first developed by Chris Wadsworth in 1971.

== Motivation ==
A simple example of evaluating an arithmetic expression follows:

:formula_1

The above reduction sequence employs a strategy known as outermost tree reduction. The same expression can be evaluated using innermost tree reduction, yielding the reduction sequence:

:formula_2

Notice that the reduction order is made explicit by the addition of parentheses. This expression could also have been simply evaluated right to left, because addition is an associative operation.

Represented as a tree, the expression above looks like this:

This is where the term tree reduction comes from. When represented as a tree, we can think of innermost reduction as working from the bottom up, while outermost works from the top down.

The expression can also be represented as a directed acyclic graph, allowing sub-expressions to be shared:

As for trees, outermost and innermost reduction also applies to graphs. Hence we have graph reduction.

Now evaluation with outermost graph reduction can proceed as follows:

Notice that evaluation now only requires four steps. Outermost graph reduction is referred to as lazy evaluation and innermost graph reduction is referred to as eager evaluation.

== Combinator graph reduction ==
Combinator graph reduction is a fundamental implementation technique for functional programming languages, in which a program is converted into a combinator representation which is mapped to a directed graph data structure in computer memory, and program execution then consists of rewriting parts of this graph (&quot;reducing&quot; it) so as to move towards useful results.

== History ==
The concept of a graph reduction that allows evaluated values to be shared was first developed by Chris Wadsworth in his 1971 Ph.D. dissertation. This dissertation was cited by Peter Henderson and James H. Morris Jr. in 1976 paper, “A lazy evaluator” that introduced the notion of lazy evaluation. In 1976 David Turner incorporated lazy evaluation into SASL using combinators.
SASL was an early functional programming language first developed by Turner in 1972.

<doc id="564006" wikidata="Q2907539" url="?curid=564006" title="Board of Control for Cricket in India">
<text>The Board of Control for Cricket in India, also known as BCCI, is the principal national governing body of the sport of cricket in India. Its headquarters are situated at the Cricket Centre in Churchgate, Mumbai. BCCI is the wealthiest governing body of cricket in the world. It has a revenue of more than 5,300 crore.

It is involved in talent development through grassroots programs and cricket academies. Its initiatives include coaching, infrastructure development, and player welfare programs designed to maintain and enhance India&#x27;s competitive performance internationally.

BCCI was established on 1 December 1928 in Madras under Act XXI of 1860 of Madras and was subsequently reregistered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975. It is a consortium of state cricket associations that select their representatives who elect the BCCI president. It joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926 which later became the International Cricket Council. The BCCI is an autonomous, private organization that does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India of Government of India and does not receive any grants from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The BCCI is influential in international cricket. The International Cricket Council shares the largest part of its revenue with the BCCI. IPL run by BCCI is one of the wealthiest sports leagues in the world.

In financial year 2023–2024, BCCI earned . BCCI paid in taxes for the financial year 2022–23.

R. E. Grant Govan was the first BCCI president and Anthony De Mello was its first secretary. , Roger Binny is the incumbent BCCI president and Devajit Saikia is the secretary.

BCCI has hosted multiple Cricket World Cups, and will host the 2025 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup, 2026 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, the 2029 ICC Champions Trophy, and the 2031 Cricket World Cup.

The BCCI manages four squads that represent India in international cricket; the men&#x27;s national cricket team, the women&#x27;s national cricket team, the men&#x27;s national under-19 cricket team and women&#x27;s national under-19 cricket team. It also governs developmental India A, India B and India A women&#x27;s teams. Its national selection committee, which is led by chief national selector, selects players for these teams. As part of its duties, the BCCI organises and schedules matches to be played by each of these teams, and schedules, sanctions and organises domestic cricket in India.

== History ==

The first game of cricket was played in India by European sailors, who played the sport as a recreational activity in the first half of the 18th century. These sailors played cricket near their coastal settlements. The first recorded match in India was played between the British army and British settlers in 1751. The world&#x27;s second-oldest cricket club, Calcutta Cricket Club, was founded in 1792 in present-day Kolkata. The Parsis were the first civilian community to accept cricket as a sport and play it in India. In 1848, they set up the Oriental Cricket Club in present-day Mumbai. In 1850, they founded the Young Zoroastrian Cricket Club. In 1886, Hindus founded the Hindu Gymkhana sports club.

In 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, and were sponsored and captained by the Maharaja of Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to attend meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor of the current International Cricket Council. Although technically not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were allowed to attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was the MCC&#x27;s decision to send a team that was led by Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in The Ashes, to India.

===Founding and early years===

In a meeting with the Maharaja of Patiala and others, Gilligan promised to press for its inclusion in the ICC if all of the game&#x27;s promoters in the country united to establish a single controlling body. An assurance was given and on 21 November 1927 a meeting was held in Delhi, which was attended by delegates from Patiala, Delhi, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar, Central Provinces and Berar, Sindh and Punjab. The delegates agreed to create a board for control of cricket in India. On 10 December 1927, a unanimous decision to form a provisional board of control was taken, and the BCCI was formed in December 1928. R. E. Grant Govan was elected as its first president and Anthony de Mello was secretary.

In 1926, the BCCI joined the Imperial Cricket Council, then the governing body for international cricket. In 1936, the BCCI started India&#x27;s premier first-class cricket championship the Ranji Trophy, which was named after the first Indian person who played international cricket, the King of Nawanagar state K.S. Ranjitsinhji, who played for England in international cricket. The Mumbai cricket team is the most-successful team, winning 42 titles.

In 1932, India played its maiden Test match under the captaincy of C. K. Nayudu against England at Lord&#x27;s cricket ground in London. During England&#x27;s 1933-34 tour of India, on 17 December 1933, Lala Amarnath became the first Indian batsman to score a test century, scoring 118 on his debut, at Bombay Gymkhana. In 1967–68, India won its first-ever Test cricket series outside Asia. Previously it had defeated Pakistan, New Zealand and England, and won series in India.

===1945–1987===
In 1952, the England team toured India; it was their first tour of India after its Independence. Nigel Howard was the captain of touring team. The former India captain Vijaya Ananda Gajapathi Raju, also known as Vizzy, was the BCCI president in the 1960s.

In 1975, the BCCI paid per match to the test cricketers. Banks, Indian railways and private enterprises would recruit players.

The board appointed Ajit Wadekar captain in 1971, the Indian team won their first test series against England on English soil, and against the West Indies, Sunil Gavaskar made his test debut in latter series.

India won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, defeating the defending champions the West Indies by 43 runs in the final at Lord&#x27;s. India also won the World Championship of Cricket in 1985, defeating Pakistan by eight wickets in the final at Melbourne Cricket Ground. The BCCI hosted the 1987 World Cup; it was the first time the event was organised outside England.

===1987–2000===
Through the 1980s and early 1990s, BCCI paid per match to terrestrial television network Doordarshan to broadcast the Indian cricket team&#x27;s matches.

It hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup competitions in 1987 and 1996.

In 1991, BCCI proposed South Africa&#x27;s readmission to international cricket at the International Cricket Council (ICC). After the proposal succeeded, the BCCI sold television broadcast rights for the first time; South African Broadcasting Corporation purchased the rights to broadcast the South African cricket tour of India, South Africa&#x27;s first official international tour after the 21-year boycott from international cricket. During this time, South Africa joined the &quot;Asian bloc&quot; of the BCCI and its South-Asian neighbours.

In 1993, the BCCI signed a deal with &quot;TransWorld International&quot; (TWI), which would pay the BCCI to televise England&#x27;s tour of India on satellite television and Doordarshan would pay TWI for the rights to televise the matches in India. The 1993 Hero Cup was broadcast on Star TV, which made it the first cricket series to be broadcast on satellite television in India and broke the monopoly of Doordarshan. A lengthy legal battle between Doordarshan and the BCCI—which was led by Jagmohan Dalmiya and president I. S. Bindra—ensued. In February 1995, the Supreme Court of India ruled the television rights of India&#x27;s matches were a commodity belonging to the BCCI, for which the broadcaster must pay BCCI and not the other way around.

BCCI, in a joint bid with Pakistan and Sri Lanka, won the rights to host the 1996 Cricket World Cup, defeating the England-and-Australia bloc. The tournament was a commercial success, yielding the ICC a profit of $50 million.

In 1997, Dalmiya became the president of the ICC. With Dalmiya at the head of the ICC, the BCCI led a successful proposal to grant Test status to Bangladesh in 1999–2000.

===21st century===

Since 2000, the BCCI has hosted and organised multiple ICC cricket World Cups competitions that is men&#x27;s 2011 ODI world cup, the 2023 ODI world cup, the 2016 T20 world cup, the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy and 2021 T20 world cups; 2013, 2016 Women&#x27;s Cricket world cups.

In 2007, the BCCI established the Indian Premier League (IPL), an annual, franchise-based, Twenty20 cricket league. In 2008, the BCCI sold the ownership rights of eight city-based franchises to corporate groups and Bollywood celebrities in a closed auction for a total of 723.49 million; it also sold the tournament&#x27;s global media rights for 10 years to World Sport Group for 1.03 billion. The media deal was re-negotiated the following year to $1.6 billion. In 2010, the BCCI expanded the league to 10 teams, selling two new franchises for a total of 703 million. Due to the IPL&#x27;s commercial success, similarly styled Twenty20 leagues appeared around the world, as did franchise-based leagues in other sports in India.

In 2014, the BCCI, Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board seized control of several of the ICC&#x27;s key committees to form the &quot;Big Three&quot;. The foundation of the &quot;Big Three&quot; would result in a complete remodelling of world cricket, with India, England, and Australia now commanding most of cricket&#x27;s revenue for the foreseeable future.

In 2019, the BCCI recognised retired players&#x27; union the Indian Cricketers&#x27; Association (ICA), which was formed after the Supreme court appointed Lodha committee&#x27;s recommendation to form an independent organisation for welfare of nation&#x27;s players. The board also includes this union&#x27;s one person as &quot;ICA representative&quot; in BCCI and IPL&#x27;s apex governing council.

On 14 February 2022, it laid foundation stone for new National Cricket Academy (NCA) at Bangalore, which will replace old NCA located near M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Banglore.

==State association leagues==
Membership of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is made up of full and associate members. The majority of full members are state cricket associations. Each state is permitted one representative, except for Gujarat and Maharashtra, which have three. There are additional representatives from Indian Railways, Services and Universities. Changes recommended by the Lodha Committee included restricting full membership to state associations and limiting states to one full member, with the others becoming associate members, but these have not been fully adopted by the BCCI, with existing members retaining full membership except for Cricket Club of India (Mumbai) and National Cricket Club (Kolkata).

Associations not meeting the criteria for full members are classified as associate.

== Controversies ==

=== Conflicts of interest ===

India Cements-Chennai Super Kings owner and former president N. Srinivasan was criticised for his alleged biased behaviour towards some state boards by awarding them ODI, Test and T20I matches while in office, possibly in violation of the board&#x27;s rotation policy on venues.

During Srinivasan&#x27;s tenure as treasurer in BCCI before he became the president, the board constitution was amended to facilitate him to buy an IPL franchise, through his company India Cements during the 2008 IPL team auction (An event held where 8 teams was sold through an open auction). Srinivasan courted further controversy for appointing India national side&#x27;s and Chennai Super Kings&#x27; (CSK) captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a vice-president of India Cements. He also interfered in national team&#x27;s selection, in 2012 ex BCCI selector Mohinder Amarnath revealed that selectors wanted to sack Dhoni from skipper post, after India lost 8 test in a row, including &quot;disastrous series in Australia&quot;, they wanted to replace him, it was a unanimous decision by selectors, but Srinivasan didn&#x27;t allow it to happen. Srinivasan&#x27;s son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, who was team principal of CSK, was arrested for involvement in Spot-fixing and betting. Then unrecognised state association by BCCI, the Bihar Cricket Association, filed a petition against it for mismanagement and conflict of interest in its investigation of 2013 IPL corruption scandal. In 2013, Mumbai police arrested the Indian cricket team&#x27;s regular player S. Sreesanth, other players and IPL team owners of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for their dealings with the illegal betting industry. In 2015, the Supreme Court appointed the Lodha Committee suspended Chennai Super Kings from the IPL for two years, and suspended Meiyappan from cricket activities for life. In 2013, Rupa Gurunath—N Shrinivasan&#x27;s daughter and Gurunath Meiyappan&#x27;s wife—who was then president of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, was found guilty of conflict of interest by the BCCI&#x27;s ethics officer Justice D.K. Jain. In 2015, the Supreme Court of India barred Srinivasan from the BCCI for contesting elections due to his conflict of interests; the court also struck down the amendments of BCCI constitution that had allowed him to own and operate an IPL team. However he still owns the CSK franchise. In January 2015, Supreme court quashed BCCI&#x27;s rule, which allowed its administrators to have financial interests in cash rich leagues such as Championship league, IPL etc. The court barred individuals including N Shrinivasan from BCCI election, who have financial interests in events organised by BCCI.

The BCCI does not allow its contracted, non-contracted, national and domestic players to participate in any cricket leagues abroad. Only players who have retired from all formats of Indian cricket can take part in foreign leagues. Players such as Adam Gilchrist have questioned this policy. Indian players such as Suresh Raina and Robin Uthappa have urged the board to allow non-contracted players like them to participate in foreign leagues.

====Tax evasions====
BCCI has avoided paying taxes to the government on numerous occasions. One such instance was when it claimed itself to be a &quot;charitable organisation&quot;, to avoid paying taxes and often disguises itself as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). In 2014, Ministry of finance revealed that, there were as many as 213 cases of tax evasions of BCCI/IPL from 2009–10 to 2014, involving 261.64 Cr rupees. In the 2010s, almost every year the Income Tax Department demanded the &#x27;outstanding income tax&#x27; from the BCCI (see details - Tax payment ). Frequently till 2012, the board got exemptions for tax under the IT Act 1961 (section 11) but later Income tax department declared BCCI&#x27;s earnings as commercial and listed them as business incomes. During 2016 T20 world cup, Modi government gave them 10% exemption. According to &quot;Deccan Herald&#x27;s&quot; article on 19 December 2021, even though BCCI is one of the world&#x27;s richest sports bodies and earns thousands of millions of rupees per year, it shows unwillingness to pay income taxes and finds loopholes in laws to avoid paying taxes.

==== Politicians in the board ====

Politicians from multiple political parties have held positions within BCCI; Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party, Madhavrao Scindia of the Indian National Congress and Anurag Thakur of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were BCCI presidents, , latter&#x27;s brother Arun Singh Dhumal is the IPL chairman. Jay Shah, the son of the Home Minister of India Amit Shah, is BCCI&#x27;s secretary. Rajiv Shukla of the Congress party is its vice-president, he is in BCCI continuously since 2000s and held various top positions, he was IPL president from 2011 to 2017. Ashish Shelar of BJP is the treasurer.

=== Lodha committee reform ===
The BCCI has been criticised for its monopolistic practices, and has suffered from allegations of corruption and cronyism. Supreme Court of India appointed a committee to make reforms in BCCI, headed by justice R. M. Lodha, the Lodha committee suggested many reforms to the BCCI, but BCCI did not implemented them as a result Supreme court removed officials of the BCCI. On 30 January 2017, The Supreme Court of India nominated a four-member &#x27;Committee of Administrators&#x27; (COA) composed of Vinod Rai, Ramachandra Guha, Vikram Limaye and Diana Edulji to administer the BCCI to implement Lodha Committee&#x27;s reforms. Vinod Rai, a retired civil servant and the former Comptroller and Auditor General of India, led the committee, which administered the board until elections could be conducted.

Many years BCCI consistently opposed to adhere regulations of the National Anti-Doping Agency, India (NADA). On 9 August 2019, it agreed to adhere the anti-doping mechanisms governed by the NADA.

===Rebel league===
The rebel league the Indian Cricket League (ICL) was owned and operated by Essel Group. BCCI banned Indian players who played in the ICL, including Hemang Badani, Dinesh Mongia, Rohan Gavaskar and Ambati Rayudu, but later gave amnesty to these players and lifted theirs bans after they ended their ties with the ICL. The BCCI blacklisted Essel Group company Zee Entertainment Enterprises due to this league, and expelled it from the BCCI in 2021. Zee was prohibited from buying BCCI&#x27;s media rights. In 2006, the BCCI sold the Indian cricket team&#x27;s media rights to Zee for the 2006-11 period but after Essel Group initiated the ICL, the BCCI terminated this deal. Zee fought a long legal battle with the BCCI; on 12 March 2018, a tribunal headed by three judges found BCCI guilty and asked them to pay Zee for losses. The tribunal found blacklisting of Zee by BCCI was illegal and said in judgement; &quot;To us it seems that BCCI was exploiting its dominating position in respect of game of cricket in India&quot; and also added Zee and its affiliated companies to the blacklist and banning them from participating in the BCCI bidding process was illegal.

===Virat Kohli sacking===
In 2021 BCCI sacked Virat Kohli from ODI captaincy, then President Ganguly told media that the BCCI asked him to remain captain but Kohli was not interested. After which Kohli took a press conference and contradicted him (Ganguly), revealing that BCCI did not ask him to remain captain. In February 2023, in a sting operation of Zee News, then chief national selector Chetan Sharma, made shocking revelations, accusing Kohli of lying and in fact president Ganguly had told him to remain as captain, in a meeting in front of all the selectors. According to Sharma, Virat Kohli was considering himself bigger than BCCI and wanted to teach a lesson to the president of the BCCI. He also revealed that after Kohli resigned from T20 captaincy, BCCI decided to sack him from ODI captaincy as well because they did not want two separate captains for limited overs format.

Sharma also alleged that lots of Indian players take injections to expedite their return in national team despite being 80 to 85% fit. After few days he resigned from his post.

===Criticism of BCCI and National selection committee===
BCCI and its selection committee are routinely slammed for irregularities in their selection process. Ideally, the national team&#x27;s selectors should select players based upon their performance in all forms of domestic cricket but often a higher precedence is alleged to be given to the performance in the IPL, even in the selection of Test squads. This results in the de facto exclusion of players who regularly do well in domestic tournaments like the Ranji Trophy. In 2023 Sunil Gavaskar, Wasim Jaffer, Abhinav Mukund, media and many fans slammed BCCI for doing this, Gavaskar fumed said if you (BCCI-selectors) do not consider and choose best performers from Ranji trophy for India&#x27;s Test team then stop organising it (Ranji trophy), then just organise IPL and select players from it. Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly also has raised questions on selection process, while talking about appointment of Ajinkya Rahane as Test team&#x27;s vice-captain for the 2023 West Indies tour. Rahane was dropped from the Test team for 18 months, then BCCI selected him in the squad for the 2023 World test championship final, and after playing just one game they (BCCI) made him vice-captain of the Test team; Ganguly said there should be &quot;consistency and continuity&quot; in selection process, this is &quot;difficult to understand&quot;. Some also claim that BCCI&#x27;s selectors use different yard stick for different players, they usually select players by looking their stardom, big name, past performance rather than current. It is said that the selectors often choose players for national side by considering their one or two best innings in IPL, it seems awarding Indian cap (place in national team) has became[sic] an everydays affair. The position of the captain is also not fixed in the team, random players getting selected as captain, almost each bilateral series had new captain, it is evident by the fact that as of July 2022, the Indian team had 8 different people as captain in last 1 year, almost everyone who played in last 5 year for the team got opportunity to become national team&#x27;s captain. Venkatesh Prasad said &quot;There is no consistency in selection random stuff happening too much.&quot; Since last 2 to 3 years, BCCI consistently doing experiments with the national team (senior men&#x27;s team), numerous players got selected, but majority of them never got chance to play consistently, as a result of this, there is uncertainty in the one day team, apart from 3-4 players, it&#x27;s not certain who will get selected and who will not (Specially for world cup 2023). It is said that due to BCCI&#x27;s experiments since 2019 world cup, the team yet not settled, even though 2023 world cup is 2.5 months away. The players are also inconsistent in their performance.

In July 2023, BCCI has faced heavy criticism on social media for not broadcasting domestic tournaments such Deodhar trophy, Duleep trophy etc. on TV.

<text>Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck (20 March 1870 – 9 March 1964), popularly known as the Lion of Africa (), was a general in the Imperial German Army and the commander of its forces in the German East Africa campaign. For four years, with a force of about 14,000 (3,000 Germans and 11,000 Africans), he held in check a much larger force of 300,000 British, Indian, Belgian, and Portuguese troops. He is known for never being defeated or captured in battle.

Lettow-Vorbeck was the only German commander to successfully invade a part of the British Empire during the First World War. His exploits in the campaign have been described by historian Edwin Palmer Hoyt as &quot;the greatest single guerrilla operation in history, and the most successful&quot;.

Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck was son of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck (1832–1919) and Marie von Eisenhart-Rothe (1842–1919). He was born into the Pomeranian minor nobility, while his father was stationed as an army officer at Saarlouis in the Prussian Rhine Province. He was educated in boarding schools in Berlin and joined the cadet corps at Potsdam and Berlin-Lichterfelde. In 1890, he was commissioned a &quot;Leutnant&quot; into the Imperial German Army.

According to Robert Gaudi, &quot;In &quot;Mein Leben&quot; von Lettow writes nostalgically of his decade as a junior officer in the Kaiser&#x27;s Imperial Army: there were Dawn inspections in the biting cold, regimental maneuvers, glimpses of the luminaries of the day – the Kaiser, Crown Prince Friedrich, the &quot;Man of Gold&quot; Field Marshal Count von Moltke, who was Germany&#x27;s greatest military strategist, and others. There were drinking parties with fellow officers, card games till all hours, and splendid dances in Berlin – the young women shivering in their off-the-shoulder dresses, the new officers in bright stiff uniforms - followed by the mad rush to catch the last train back to Spandau barracks before the last roll call&quot;.

Lettow-Vorbeck later wrote, &quot;I recall an older officer scolding a younger one because he failed to ask a young woman who was without a partner to dance. Offenses against chivalry were not tolerated&quot;.

Lt. von Lettow-Vorbeck was assigned to the Great German General Staff.

==Military career==
In 1900, Lettow-Vorbeck was posted to China as a member of the international alliance forces to quell the Boxer Rebellion. Although Lettow-Vorbeck was fascinated by the ancient history and elaborate courtesy of Chinese culture, he intensely disliked fighting against guerrillas and considered the war detrimental to the discipline of the German Army. He returned to the German General Staff from China in 1901.

Beginning in 1904, Lettow-Vorbeck, now a captain, was assigned to German Southwest Africa (now Namibia), during the Herero insurrection and the subsequent genocide.

Lettow-Vorbeck saw combat against the Herero at the Battle of Waterberg, which he later called, &quot;something rarely encountered in guerrilla warfare, a chance to defeat them in a single operation.&quot;

When the Nama people also rose against German rule under the leadership of Hendrik Witbooi, Lettow-Vorbeck remained in German Southwest Africa in order to continue fighting. He played a major role in the pursuit of Jacob Morenga. During a 1906 gunfight against Morenga and his men, Lettow-Vorbeck suffered injuries to his left eye, which was left blind, and his chest.

He was then evacuated to South Africa for treatment and recovery.

Leonard Mosley would later write, however, &quot;It was from these brilliant and fantastic Hottentots that Lettow-Vorbeck learned the Bushcraft that was to prove of such value to him in his war against the British in East Africa. When [Hottentot guerrilla leader] Samuel Isaak was captured and brought in for questioning, it was von Lettow who conducted the interrogations... His questions were how to live off a country which offers no apparent sustenance, how to run in conditions when most men barely have the strength to walk, how to condition the body to go without food or water, and most important of all, how to become so much a part, so absorbed into an unfriendly wilderness that survival is possible as the snakes and land crabs and lizards survive&quot;.

In 1907 Lettow-Vorbeck was promoted to Major and assigned to the staff of XI Corps at Kassel, Hesse. From March 1909 to January 1913, he was commanding officer of the marines of &quot;II. Seebataillon&quot; (&quot;2nd Sea Battalion&quot;) at Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxony. In October 1913, the Imperial German army promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel and appointed him to command the German colonial forces, known as the &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; (protectorate force), in German Kamerun (today&#x27;s Cameroon, plus a portion of present-day Nigeria). Before he could assume this command, however, his orders were changed and he was posted — with effect from 13 April 1914 — to German East Africa (Tanganyika, the mainland territory of present-day Tanzania).

While travelling to his new assignment, Lettow-Vorbeck formed a lifelong friendship with Danish author Karen Blixen (also known by her pen name of Isak Dinesen), who was travelling aboard the same liner. Decades later, she recalled that, &quot;He belonged to the olden days, and I have never met another German who has given me so strong an impression of what Imperial Germany was and stood for.&quot;

==First World War==
Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s plan for the war was relatively simple: knowing that East Africa would only be a sideshow to other theatres of war, he was determined to tie down as many British troops as he could. He intended to keep them away from the Western Front, and in this way to contribute to the German war effort.

In August 1914 Lettow-Vorbeck was the commander of a military garrison of 2,600 German nationals and 2,472 African soldiers in fourteen Askari field companies. Feeling the need to seize the initiative, he disregarded orders from Berlin and the colony&#x27;s Governor, Heinrich Schnee, who had attempted to achieve neutrality for German East Africa, relying on the Congo Act of 1885, by which the European colonial powers had promised to keep their overseas possessions neutral in any European wars. He thus prepared to repel a major British amphibious assault on the city of Tanga. The attack began on 2 November 1914, and for the next four days the German forces fought the Battle of Tanga. Lettow-Vorbeck then assembled his men and their scant supplies to attack the British railways in East Africa. He scored a second victory over the British at Jassin on 19 January 1915. These victories allowed the Germans to capture much needed rifles and other supplies, in addition to boosting the troops&#x27; morale. Lettow-Vorbeck also lost many experienced men, however, including the &quot;splendid Captain Tom von Prince&quot;, whom he could not easily replace.
Though casualties were high, Lettow insisted his commanders engage British forces, though they offered few enticing targets. This forced him to conduct raids into British East Africa (later Kenya, Uganda, and Zanzibar), targeting forts, railways, and communications, still hoping to force the &quot;Entente&quot; to divert manpower from the main theatre of war in Europe. Realizing the critical needs of guerrilla warfare, he used everything available to him to keep his troops supplied.

The &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; recruited new personnel and expanded its size to some 14,000 soldiers, most of them Askaris. Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s fluency in the Swahili language apparently earned the respect and admiration of his African soldiers. He appointed black officers and reportedly stated that &quot;we are all Africans here&quot;. In one historian&#x27;s opinion, &quot;It is probable that no white commander of the era had so keen an appreciation of the African&#x27;s worth not only as a fighting man but as a man.&quot;The historian Michael von Herff says the loyalty of Askaris during the campaign was due to them having formed a military caste within the colonial structure, which had largely separated itself from its members&#x27; tribal roots.
In 1915, he gained the men and artillery of the German cruiser which had been scuttled in the Rufiji River delta. The cruiser had a capable crew under commander Max Looff, and its artillery pieces, converted to land use, became the largest standard guns used in the East African Theatre. In March 1916 British forces under General Jan Smuts and the Belgians under Charles Tombeur launched an offensive with 45,000 men near Tabora. Lettow-Vorbeck used the climate and terrain to his advantage, engaging the British on his terms. British reinforcements forced Lettow-Vorbeck to yield territory. Continuing his resistance, Lettow-Vorbeck fought a crucial battle at Mahiwa in October 1917, where he inflicted 2,700 casualties on the British. Lettow-Vorbeck himself lost 519 men killed, wounded, or missing while also running critically low on ammunition, forcing him to withdraw. The British would proceed to recover their losses and continue to hold an overwhelming advantage in numbers of men. For the &quot;Schutztruppe&quot;, this was serious, for there were no reserves with which to replenish their ranks. After news of the battle reached Germany, however, Lettow-Vorbeck was promoted to major-general (&quot;Generalmajor&quot;).
Lettow-Vorbeck thus withdrew to the south, with his troops on half rations and the British in pursuit. On 25 November 1917, his advance column waded across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese Mozambique. Having essentially cut their own supply lines, the &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; caravan became a completely independent unit. On its first day across the river, the column attacked the newly replenished Portuguese garrison of Ngomano and solved its supply problems for the foreseeable future. The subsequent capture of a river steamer with a load of medical supplies, including quinine, satisfied some of its medical needs as well. For almost a year Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s men had lived off whatever was available, mainly provisions captured from the British and Portuguese; they had replaced their old rifles with new equipment and acquired machine guns and mortars after capturing Namakura (Namacurra in modern Mozambique) in July 1918.
The war in East Africa set off a chain of events with devastating results for the natives and their German overlords. The invasions caused interruptions throughout the colony, so that the land no longer &quot;basked in a climate of plenty.&quot;

Lettow-Vorbeck considered his first obligation as a military commander that to his army, over the objections of Governor Heinrich Schnee. The governor regarded war as the worst possible calamity to befall German East Africa, &quot;[undoing] everything his social and economic reforms had accomplished.&quot; Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s strategy, meanwhile, held central giving ground and escaping confrontations with Allied forces. He had thus established food depots along his intended line of march from Neu Moshi to the Uluguru Mountains, writing off famine in neighboring villages as a misfortune of war.

Little aid from Germany could penetrate the British naval blockade to alleviate the enormous supply deficiencies facing Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s men in the area, and only two ships succeeded in running the blockade and reaching the colony. On 14 April 1915, the freighter &quot;Kronborg&quot; arrived off Tanga at Manza Bay after a two-month journey from Wilhelmshaven, and was promptly attacked by the British cruiser HMS &quot;Hyacinth&quot;. Fortunately for the Germans, &quot;Kronborg&quot; was scuttled by her captain to avoid a coal fire after repeated hits were scored by the British cruiser, and the ship settled in shallow water. Nearly the entire cargo could then be salvaged. However, when the steamer &quot;Marie von Stettin&quot; arrived south of Lindi on 17 March 1916, its cargo of 1,500 tons was of only very modest help to Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s forces.

An attempt in November 1917 to resupply German forces by Zeppelin airship, an operation codenamed &quot;the China Show&quot;, failed. The Zeppelin, LZ 104 (L 59), intended also as a morale-booster to the beleaguered East African troops, was designed to be dismembered on arrival and all its parts cannibalised as spares for the troops - the canvas of its hull used for tents, for example. The airship reached the Sudan, in a single uninterrupted flight from Bulgaria, where it received a message from the German Admiralty that its planned landing area in East Africa was no longer in Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s hands. Its captain decided to turn back. The British later claimed the about-turn was a result of a fake radio message sent in German by British intelligence in Cairo stating that Lettow-Vorbeck had surrendered, but this has never been proven.

By late September 1916, all of coastal German East Africa, including Dar es Salaam and the Central Railway, was under British control. The west of the colony was meanwhile occupied by Belgian forces. In December 1917, the German colony was officially declared an Allied protectorate.

Lettow-Vorbeck and his caravan of Europeans, Askaris, porters, women, and children marched on, deliberately bypassing the tribal homelands of the native soldiers in an effort to prevent desertions. They traversed difficult territory. &quot;Swamps and jungles ... what a dismal prospect there is in front of me,&quot; stated the Allied commander in pursuit, General Jan Smuts, whose new approach was subsequently not to fight the &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; at all, but to go after their food supply. When the end of the campaign eventually came, Smuts was in London and General J. L. van Deventer commanded East Africa.

His actions were described as &quot;a campaign of supreme ruthlessness where a small, well trained force extorted supplies from civilians to whom it felt no responsibility...it was the climax of Africa&#x27;s exploitation&quot;. Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s tactics led to a famine that killed thousands of Africans and weakened the population, leaving it vulnerable to the Spanish influenza epidemic in 1919.

In a book published in 1919, Ludwig Deppe, a doctor of medicine who campaigned with Lettow-Vorbeck and who had formerly headed the hospital at Tanga, lamented the tragedy that German forces had imposed on East Africa in their war with the Allies: &quot;Behind us we leave destroyed fields, ransacked magazines and, for the immediate future, starvation. We are no longer the agents of culture, our track is marked by death, plundered and evacuated villages, just like the progress of our own and enemy armies in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.&quot; When the worldwide Spanish influenza epidemic swept into eastern Africa in 1918–1919, it struck down thousands of people. The weakened state of many native Africans, resulting from the war, made them especially susceptible.

Lettow-Vorbeck was greatly respected by his white officers, non-commissioned officers and Askaris, and even Allied forces. In the field when rations had to be reduced and supplies dwindled,&quot;It was a measure of the Askaris&#x27; loyalty to their commander that they accepted the cuts and did not desert en masse. Some did desert, of course... But the German Askaris were by far the most loyal as well as the most effective, and it all went back to… Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s brand of discipline, which bound him and his German officers as much as his black soldiers&quot;.

There is a &quot;legend&quot; that Lettow-Vorbeck once lost his glass eye in the bush. When an &quot;askari&quot; returned it to him and enquired why the colonel had removed it, Lettow-Vorbeck replied that &quot;he had placed it there to watch that the &quot;askari&quot; were doing their duty&quot;.

On 28 September 1918, Lettow-Vorbeck again crossed the Ruvuma River and returned to German East Africa, with the British still in pursuit. He then turned west and raided Northern Rhodesia, evading an ambush that the British had prepared in German East Africa. On 13 November 1918, two days after the Armistice, he took the town of Kasama, which the British had evacuated, and continued heading south-west towards Katanga. When he reached the Chambeshi River on the morning of 14 November, the British magistrate Hector Croad appeared under a white flag and delivered a message from South African General Jacob van Deventer, informing Lettow-Vorbeck of the Armistice. Lettow-Vorbeck agreed to a cease-fire at the spot now marked by the Chambeshi Monument in present-day Zambia. He was instructed by the British to march north to Abercorn to surrender his army, arriving there on 25 November. The remains of his army at the time consisted of 30 German officers, 125 German non-commissioned officers and other enlisted ranks, 1,168 Askaris, and some 3,500 porters.

After hostilities ended, the British transferred the German POWs to Dar es Salaam for eventual repatriation. Lettow-Vorbeck made several efforts to secure an early release for his Askaris, who were in a POW camp at Tabora.

Before Lettow-Vorbeck was separated from his Askaris, one of them cried out, &quot;I have been asked to say this to you &quot;Bwana&quot; General. Where do you go now? Where you go, we will go with you! And if this is not the time, then wait until my son grows up to be a warrior and he will take my place and go with you. We will go with the &quot;Bwana&quot; General, will we not?&quot;Robert Gaudi writes, &quot;To a man, the Askaris stepped forward, ready to follow the commander to the ends of the Earth. But von Lettow held them back with a gesture and kept on marching. His war was over now.&quot;

==Post-war==

Lettow-Vorbeck returned to Germany in early March 1919 to a hero&#x27;s welcome. He led the veterans of the &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; in their tattered tropical uniforms on a victory parade through the Brandenburg Gate, which was decorated in their honour. He was the only German commander to successfully invade the British Empire during the First World War.

He remained in the Reichswehr despite attempts to involve him in the politics of the Weimar Republic. Fourteen months after his return to Germany, Lettow-Vorbeck commanded the troops that ended the Spartacist Uprising in Hamburg. However, Lettow-Vorbeck then lost his commission in the Reichswehr in the summer of 1920 following his involvement in the Kapp Putsch. He subsequently worked in Bremen as an import-export manager.
In June 1926, Lettow-Vorbeck met Richard Meinertzhagen in Bremen, the British Intelligence Corps Colonel with whom he had fought a battle of wits until December 1916, when Meinertzhagen was invalided. Three years later, Lettow-Vorbeck accepted an invitation to London where he met face-to-face for the first time Jan Smuts; the two men formed a lasting friendship. When Smuts died in 1950, Lettow-Vorbeck sent his widow a letter expressing his sympathy for her loss.

A similar oft-quoted claim states that Lettow-Vorbeck also apologised for the &quot;ungentlemanly death&quot; of the British hunter Frederick Selous at the hands of one of his snipers; this claim, however, is not supported by any contemporary evidence.

===Political career===
In a review of the work on Lettow-Vorbeck by Uwe Schulte-Varendorff, historian Eckard Michels agrees with Schulte-Varendorff that Lettow-Vorbeck did not directly show susceptibility to far right politics and anti-Semitism. Eckard Michels also writes, however, that Lettow-Vorbeck did not seek publicity out of opportunism or greed and only morphed into a public figure because of the society at the time&#x27;s desire for a reminder of bygone times.

Between May 1928 and July 1930, Lettow-Vorbeck served as a Reichstag deputy for the monarchist German National People&#x27;s Party. He left the party in 1930, after Alfred Hugenberg became the party leader and drew it increasingly into the far right. Lettow-Vorbeck then joined the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and ran for it in the election of 1930, where he gained the best result of the party in his electoral district of Upper Bavaria, but was not re-elected. He intensely &quot;distrusted Hitler and his movement,&quot; and approached his relative Hans-Jürgen von Blumenthal with an idea to form a coalition with &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; against the Nazis. This resulted in the Vorbeck-Blumenthal Pact.

==Nazi Germany==
Later, when Hitler offered him the ambassadorship to the Court of St James&#x27;s in 1935, he &quot;declined with frigid hauteur&quot;; the suggestion for the nomination as ambassador to the Court of St James had come from retired Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen during a visit to Berlin. During the 1960s, Charles Miller asked the nephew of a &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; officer, &quot;I understand that von Lettow told Hitler to go fuck himself.&quot; The nephew responded, &quot;That&#x27;s right, except that I don&#x27;t think he put it that politely.&quot;

After his blunt refusal, Lettow &quot;was kept under continual surveillance&quot; and his home office was searched. Thanks to his popularity among the German people, he was promoted to the rank of General for Special Purposes in 1938, at the age of 68, but was never recalled to active service.

One of Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s junior officers, Theodor von Hippel, used his experiences in East Africa to form the Brandenburgers, the commando unit of the Abwehr, the German military intelligence service during the Second World War.

==&quot;Die Stunde Null&quot;==
By the end of the Second World War, Lettow-Vorbeck was destitute. His house in Bremen had been destroyed by Allied bombs, and he depended for a time on food packages from his friends Meinertzhagen and Smuts. After the postwar economic boom, however, he enjoyed comfortable circumstances again. In 1953 he visited Dar-es-Salaam, where he was welcomed by surviving Askaris who greeted him with their old marching song &quot;Heia Safari!&quot; British colonial officials welcomed him with full military honours.

As colonialism came to an end in Africa, several activists for the independence of Tanganyika, who were all the sons of Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s Askaris, came to seek his advice. As there had been violence against the White population in the former colony of German East Africa, Lettow-Vorbeck later recalled that he gave one of them, who later became a government official in independent Tanzania, &quot; ..a good talking to. I told him not to despise the White people and not to humiliate them for the mistakes they made. &#x27;We only repudiate the small men, father,&#x27; he replied, &#x27;When the White Man is big enough, as you were big enough, we continue to respect him.&#x27;&quot; Lettow-Vorbeck was pleased by this answer, and laughed and slapped his knee when he told Leonard Mosley about the conversation.

==Personal life==
After his return from Africa, Lettow-Vorbeck married Martha Wallroth (1884–1953) in 1919. They had two sons and two daughters: Rüdiger (1921–1940), Arnd (1922–1941), Heloise (1923-2018), and Ursula (1927).

Both his two sons, Rüdiger and Arnd von Lettow-Vorbeck, and his stepson Peter Wallroth, were killed in action serving in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

==Death==
In 1964, eleven days before his 94th birthday, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck died in Hamburg. The West German government and the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; flew in two former Askaris as state guests to attend the funeral.

Several officers of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; were assigned as an honour guard, and West Germany&#x27;s Minister of Defence, Kai-Uwe von Hassel, gave the eulogy, saying that the deceased, &quot;was truly undefeated in the field&quot;. Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck was buried in Pronstorf, Schleswig-Holstein, in the graveyard of Vicelin Church.

==Legacy==
In the year of Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s death, 1964, the West German &quot;Bundestag&quot; voted to give back-dated pay to all surviving Askaris from the German forces of the First World War. A temporary cashier&#x27;s office was set up in Mwanza on Lake Victoria. Of the 350 former soldiers who gathered, only a handful could produce the certificates that Lettow-Vorbeck had given them in 1918. Others presented pieces of their old uniforms as proof of service. The German banker who had brought the money then had an idea. Each claimant was asked to step forward, was handed a broom, and was ordered in German to perform drills from their manual of arms. Not one man failed the test.

Four barracks of the Federal German Army, or &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, were once named in Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s honour. They were situated at Leer, Hamburg-Jenfeld, Bremen, and Bad Segeberg. Following the recent closure of 178 military installations, the only one remaining is the Lettow-Vorbeck-Kaserne in Leer, East Frisia. The former Hamburg-Jenfeld barracks houses the &quot;Tanzania Park&quot;, a group of large terracotta relief sculptures of Lettow-Vorbeck and his Askari soldiers, now closed to the public. Another sculpture of Lettow-Vorbeck and the Askaris is on display at Mühlenteich, near the Bismarck memorial at Friedrichsruh.

In early 2010, the City Council of Saarlouis renamed &quot;Von Lettow-Vorbeck-Straße&quot;, mainly for Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s involvement in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. In Hanover, &quot;Lettow-Vorbeck Straße&quot; was renamed &quot;Namibia Straße&quot;. In Wuppertal, Cuxhaven, Mönchengladbach, Halle and Graz, Austria there are still streets named after General von Lettow-Vorbeck.

The dryosaurid species &quot;Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki&quot; was named after Lettow-Vorbeck.

==Honours==
He received the following orders and decorations:
** Officer of the Order of the Red Eagle, with Crown
** Knight of the Order of the Prussian Crown, 3rd Class with Swords
** Pour le Mérite (military), &quot;4 November 1916&quot;; with Oak Leaves, &quot;10 October 1917&quot;
** Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class 
** Knight of the Military Order of Max Joseph
** Knight of the Military Merit Order, 4th Class with Swords and Crown
* Ernestine duchies: Commander of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order, 2nd Class
* : Knight of the Order of the Württemberg Crown, with Golden Lions
* : Knight of the Order of St. Stanislaus, 3rd Class with Swords

==In popular culture==
Lettow-Vorbeck appears in a 1993 episode of the television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. The episode, which was titled &quot;The Phantom Train of Doom&quot;, begins with Indiana Jones as an officer in the Belgian Army during the First World War. Determined to destroy a &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; armoured train, Indiana takes General von Lettow-Vorbeck (played by Tom Bell) hostage and attempts to return with him behind Allied lines. When the &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; tracks them down, Indy draws his revolver to shoot the general, but decides to let him go. The general magnanimously gives him a compass so Indiana can find his way back to his lines, and the two part as friends.

Lettow-Vorbeck is the protagonist of &quot;The Ghosts of Africa&quot;, a 1980 historical novel by Anglo-Canadian novelist William Stevenson about the East African Campaign which highlighted the long-distance resupply mission of the German rigid airship L 59.

The many bureaucratic absurdities of the British campaign against General von Lettow-Vorbeck in German East Africa are satirized in William Boyd&#x27;s 1983 anti-war novel &quot;An Ice-Cream War&quot;.

Lettow-Vorbeck also appears as a character in Peter Høeg&#x27;s short story, &quot;Journey into a Dark Heart&quot;, which is the opening story in his 1990 collection, &quot;Tales of the Night&quot;. In this story Høeg imagines Lettow-Vorbeck travelling through Africa by train at night accompanied by Joseph Conrad.

Much of the history of Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s war campaign in East Africa is detailed in the book &quot;Speak Swahili, Dammit!&quot; (2011) by James Penhaligon, as well as in a novel of the same year, &quot;The Bridge Builders&quot; (&quot;Brobyggarna&quot; in Swedish) by Jan Guillou.

A German film, &quot;Lettow-Vorbeck: Der deutsch-ostafrikanische Imperativ&quot;, was produced in 1984.

<text>The Transport Act 1962 (10 &amp; 11 Eliz. 2. c. 46) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Described as the &quot;most momentous piece of legislation in the field of railway law to have been enacted since the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854&quot;, it was passed by Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government to dissolve the British Transport Commission (BTC), which had been established by Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour government in 1947 to oversee railways, canals and road freight transport. The Act established the British Railways Board, which took over the BTC&#x27;s railway responsibilities from 1 January 1963 until the passing of the Railways Act 1993.

The Act put in place measures that enabled the closure of around a third of British railways the following year as a result of the Beeching report, as the Act simplified the process of closing railways removing the need for pros and cons of each case to be heard in detail.

==Historical context==
By the end of 1960, British Railways had accumulated a deficit of some £500 million and the annual rate of increase of the deficit was estimated to be in the region of £100 million. The Act sought primarily to remedy this situation by putting public transport operators on the same footing as private companies, reversing the policy that had been in place since the earliest days of transport law, namely that the carrier was a monopolist to be controlled and regulated by the State for the benefit of the public.

==New financial management obligations==
By virtue of Sections 36 and 38 of the Act, some of the debts of the BTC, including the funds invested in the failed 1955 Modernisation Plan, were written off or transferred to the Treasury. The British Railways Board was directed, under Section 22, to run the railways so that its operating profits were &quot;not less than sufficient&quot; for meeting running costs.

The obligation to be self-sufficient was a departure in UK railway legislation and marked an important turning point. Each railway service should pay for itself or at least have the prospect of doing so. The days of general subsidisation of the railways were now clearly over. The change of policy was brought about by the Select committee of the House of Commons on Nationalised Industries, which concluded that the BTC should make its decisions exclusively on considerations of &quot;direct profitability&quot;. Where decisions based &quot;on grounds of the national economy or of social needs&quot; needed to be taken, the Minister of Transport would be responsible, having sought the approval of Parliament.

The railways would now be operated on the principles applicable to a private entrepreneur in a competitive marketplace. In that respect, section 3(1) provides that it was the duty of the British Railways Board to provide railway services &quot;in Great Britain&quot; (not &#x27;for&#x27;) with regard to &quot;efficiency, economy and safety of operation&quot;.

==Break-up of the British Transport Commission==
To facilitate the new policy, the BTC was replaced by five new public corporations:
*the British Railways Board
*the London Transport Board
*the British Transport Docks Board
*the British Waterways Board
*the Transport Holding Company (holding the shares of companies belonging to BTC, including Thomas Cook and Son Ltd and Thomas Tilling)

The four boards inherited the property, liabilities and functions of the BTC, but their activities were to be co-ordinated by the Minister of Transport, rather than a body separate from the government. The boards needed the consent of the minister to borrow and for approval for projects involving large sums of money (sections 19 and 27).

==New advisory bodies==
===Nationalised Transport Advisory Council===
Section 55 of the Act created the Nationalised Transport Advisory Council to &quot;advise&quot; the Minister of Transport on the activities of the five corporations, which would all be represented on the council.

===Transport consultative committees===
The Central Transport Consultative Committee took the place of a similar body that had been created under the Transport Act 1947 to represent users of the railway, and area transport users consultative committees covered individual areas of the country.

The committees were to make recommendations relating to the services provided by the four boards, although their remit did not include the charges and fares. The Minister was not bound to follow any recommendations.

==Procedure for closure of railway lines==
A new procedure was set out for the closure of railway lines, Section 56(7) requiring that British Railways gave at least six weeks&#x27; notice of their intention to close a line and to publish this proposal in two successive weeks in two local newspapers in the area affected. The notice would give the proposed closure dates, details of alternative transport services (including services which BR was to lay on as a result of closure) and inviting objections to a specified address. A copy of the notice was to be sent to the relevant area committee.

Rail users affected by a closure could also send their objections to the area committee (this was not required to be specified in the closure notice) who would then report to the Minister of Transport. The area committee would consider the &quot;hardship&quot; which it considered would be caused as a result of the closure, and recommend measures to ease that hardship. The closure would not then be proceeded with until the committee had reported to the minister and he had given his consent to the closure. Based on the report, the minister could subject his consent to closure to certain conditions, such as the provision of alternative transport services.

==Reform of the law of transport==
The four boards were placed in the position of private companies in respect of their commercial activities. They no longer had the status of common carrier transporting persons and goods for the public benefit, but were now bailees transporting goods and people like a private operator.

The main effect of this change was that the boards were no longer &quot;absolutely liable&quot; for their operations, i.e. bearing responsibility for loss even in the absence of negligence or fault on their part. Now they could restrict their liabilities in a similar fashion to private operateurs.

A consequence was that they could reject passenger and goods consignments and limit the exposure of their liability, and were free to &quot;&quot;demand, take and recover such charges for their services and facilities, and to make the use of those services and facilities subject to such terms and conditions as they think fit&quot; (Section 43), i.e. have total freedom of contract to sell their services, rather than operate via the medium of a statutory process. An exception was made for the London Passenger Transport Area where fares were still fixed by the Transport Tribunal.

As one commentator noted, &quot;the Act goes much further in giving effect to laissez-faire in the law of transport than English law has ever done at any time since the seventeenth century&quot;&quot;.

==Railway byelaws==
Section 67 of the Act enables byelaws regulating the use of the railways to be issued. This provision featured in &quot;Boddington v British Transport Police&quot; (1998) where the House of Lords recognised the principle that a defendant in criminal proceedings, in this case fined £10 for smoking on a train in violation of a railway byelaw, could challenge the validity of the rule before a court, save where Parliament has indicated that such a challenge is not possible.

==Current status==
Much of the Act has been repealed and updated: further information can be found by searching for the act in the UK Statute Law Database.

<doc id="564017" wikidata="Q188081" url="?curid=564017" title="String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 14 in C minor, Op. 131, was completed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1826. It is the last-composed of a trio of string quartets, written in the order Opp. 132, 130 (with the &quot;Große Fuge&quot; ending), 131.

It was Beethoven&#x27;s favourite of the late quartets: he is quoted as remarking to a friend that he would find &quot;a new manner of part-writing and, thank God, less lack of imagination than before&quot;. It is said that upon listening to a performance of this quartet Schubert remarked, &quot;After this, what is left for us to write?&quot; Schumann said that this quartet and Op. 127 had a &quot;grandeur ... which no words can express. They seem to me to stand ... on the extreme boundary of all that has hitherto been attained by human art and imagination.&quot;

This work is dedicated to Baron as a gesture of gratitude for taking Beethoven&#x27;s nephew Karl into the army after a suicide attempt. Beethoven died before the work&#x27;s publication by Schott Music and before its first performance, the date of which is uncertain.

== Music ==
About 40 minutes in length, it consists of seven movements played without break:
The Op. 131 quartet is a monumental feat of integration. While Beethoven composed the quartet in six distinct key areas, the work begins and ends in C minor. The finale directly quotes the first movement&#x27;s fugue theme in its second thematic area. This type of cyclical composition was avant-garde for a work of that period. Joseph Kerman wrote: &quot;blatant functional reference to the theme of another movement: this &quot;never&quot; happens&quot;. (It had happened in some other Beethoven works such as the Piano Sonata Op. 101, Cello Sonata Op. 102 No. 1, and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies; it had even happened before in Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Forty-Sixth Symphony. Nevertheless, Op. 131 is the first Beethoven work in which the quotation is integrated completely into its new context instead of appearing like an explicit quotation, though even this effect had been anticipated the previous year in the young Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Octet, and much earlier in Christian Latrobe&#x27;s A major Piano Sonata dedicated to Haydn.)

Op. 131 is often grouped with 132 and 130. There is motivic sharing among the three works. In particular, the &quot;motto&quot; fugue of the leading note rising to the tonic before moving to the minor sixth and then dropping down to the dominant is an important figure these works share.

This quartet is one of Beethoven&#x27;s most elusive works musically. The topic has been written about extensively since very early after its creation, from Karl Holz, the second violinist of the Schuppanzigh Quartet, to Richard Wagner, to contemporary musicologists. One popular topic is a possible religious/spiritual genesis for this work, supported by similarities to the &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;. In the first movement of Op. 131, the continually flowing texture resembles the earlier work&#x27;s Benedictus and Dona Nobis Pacem. In addition, purposely or not, Beethoven quotes a motivic figure from &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; in the quartet&#x27;s second movement.

A week before Schubert&#x27;s death, Holz and his string quartet visited to play for him. The last musical work Schubert wished to hear was the String Quartet No. 14; Holz later recalled that &quot;Schubert was sent into such transports of delight and enthusiasm and was so overcome that we all feared for him.&quot;

The piece was featured in the plot of the 2012 film &quot;A Late Quartet&quot;. It also featured in the &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; episode &quot;Why We Fight&quot;.

== Analysis ==
=== I. Adagio ma non troppo e molto espressivo ===
A fugue based on the following subject, which contains (bars 2–3) the second tetrachord of the harmonic minor scale, the unifying motif of Beethoven&#x27;s last string quartets:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative g&#x27; {
 \key cis \minor \time 2/2
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 2 = 44
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = &quot;violin&quot;
 \partial 4 gis(\&lt; |
 bis2 cis) | a2.\sf\&gt; gis4\p(| fis a gis fis | e fis) gis2\laissezVibrer |
&lt;/score&gt;
Richard Wagner said this movement &quot;reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music&quot;. Joseph Kerman calls it &quot;this most moving of all fugues&quot;. J.W.N. Sullivan (1927, p. 235) hears it as &quot;the most superhuman piece of music that Beethoven has ever written.&quot; Philip Radcliffe says &quot;[a] bare description of its formal outline can give but little idea of the extraordinary profundity of this fugue.&quot;

===II. Allegro molto vivace===
A delicate dance in compound duple meter in the key of D major, in compact sonata form based on the following folk-like theme:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative d&#x27; {
 \key d \major \time 6/8
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 2. = 80
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = &quot;violin&quot;
 \partial 4. d4.\pp(|
 d&#x27;4.)~ d4(cis8) |

 b4(a8 d4 e8 |
 fis4 e8 d4 cis8) |
 cis4\(ais8 b4 cis8 |
 d4\&lt; cis8 e(\&gt; d) b-.\) |
 a4\!
&lt;/score&gt;

===III. Allegro moderato – Adagio===
In the spirit of &quot;recitativo obbligato&quot; following the key of B minor; the modulation from B minor to E major functions as a short introduction to the next movement.

===IV. Variations===
This, the central movement of the quartet, is a set of 7 variations (6 complete and 1 incomplete, with coda) on the following simple theme in A major shared between the first and second violins:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
#(set-global-staff-size 19)
\relative a&#x27; {
 \key a \major \time 2/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 60
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = &quot;violin&quot;
 {r8\p a4^\markup { \italic dolce }(b16 a | gis8) r8 r4 | r8 d&#x27;4(e16 d |
 cis8) r8 r4 \break
 \overrideProperty Score.NonMusicalPaperColumn.line-break-system-details #&#x27;((Y-offset . 17))
 r8 a&#x27;4(\&lt; g16\&gt; eis)\! | eis8(fis) r4 | r8 e16(d cis8) r | r fis,16(e dis8) r | r8 }
 {r8 cis4.(| d8) gis4(a16 gis | d&#x27;8) b,4.(| a8) cis&#x27;4(d16 cis | a&#x27;8) r r4 | r8 fis4(\&lt; e16\&gt; cis\! | dis8)\noBeam b,(cis)\noBeam b&#x27;16(a | gis8) r r d16(b | a8) }
}
&lt;/score&gt;
The tempo indications of the variations are: Andante ma non troppo e molto cantabile – Andante moderato e lusinghiero – Adagio – Allegretto – Adagio, ma non troppo e semplice – Allegretto

This movement is the apotheosis of the &#x27;Grand Variation&#x27; form from Beethoven&#x27;s late period.

===V. Presto===
In E major, this is a brilliant scherzo (though in duple rather than triple time), based on the following simple idea:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative b&#x27; {
 \key e \major \time 2/2
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 1 = 116
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = &quot;violin&quot;
 b4-.\p gis-. e-. gis-. |

 dis4-. e-. fis-. gis-. |
 a4 r r2 |
 gis4-. fis-. e-. dis-. |
 cis2(fis) |
 gis4\f gis gis gis |
 gis r4 r2 |
&lt;/score&gt;
Toward the end of the scherzo, there is &quot;an astounding&quot; passage of &quot;pianissimo sul ponticello&quot; writing for all the instruments, mostly on their highest strings.&quot; Joseph Kerman asks, &quot;Was this a sound Beethoven had actually heard, back in the days when he was hearing, or did he make up the sound for the first time in 1826? Beethoven deaf was quite capable of &#x27;hearing&#x27; or imagining or inventing not only relationships between notes but also sonorities pure and simple.&quot;

===VI. Adagio quasi un poco andante===
In G minor, this movement is in bar form with a coda, which serves as a slow, sombre introduction to the next movement.

===VII. Allegro===
The finale is in sonata form and returns to the home key of C minor. The first subject has two main ideas:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; {
 \key cis \minor \time 2/2
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 2 = 132

<text>In music a mixed-interval chord is a chord not characterized by one consistent interval. Chords characterized by one consistent interval, or primarily but with alterations, are equal-interval chords. Mixed interval chords &quot;lend themselves particularly&quot; to atonal music since they tend to be dissonant.

Equal-interval chords are often of indeterminate root and mixed-interval chords are also often best characterized by their interval content. &quot;Equal-interval chords are often altered to make them &#x27;impure&#x27; as in the case of quartal and quintal chords with tritones, chords based on seconds with varying intervals between the seconds.&quot;

<text>Kato is a fictional character from &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; franchise. This character has appeared with the Green Hornet in radio, film, television, book and comic book versions. Kato is the Green Hornet&#x27;s crime-fighting sidekick, and Britt Reid&#x27;s manservant in civilian life, and has been played by a number of actors. On radio, Kato was initially played by Raymond Hayashi, then Roland Parker who had the role for most of the run, and in the later years Mickey Tolan and Paul Carnegie. Keye Luke took the role in the movie serials, and in the television series, he was portrayed by Bruce Lee. Jay Chou played Kato in the 2011 Green Hornet film.

==Character history==
Kato is Britt Reid&#x27;s valet, who doubles as The Green Hornet&#x27;s masked driver and partner to help him in his vigilante adventures, disguised as the activities of a racketeer and his chauffeur/bodyguard/enforcer. According to the storyline, years before the events depicted in the series, Britt Reid saved Kato&#x27;s life while traveling in the Far East. Depending on the version of the story, this prompts Kato to become Reid&#x27;s assistant or friend. In the anthology book, &quot;The Green Hornet Chronicles&quot; from Moonstone Books, author Richard Dean Starr&#x27;s story &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay: An Origin Story of Kato&quot; explores the character&#x27;s background and how he ends up living in America, suggesting that Kato met Britt Reid on a later trip back to his homeland while in search of his mother.

===Radio program and nationality===
George W. Trendle, the owner of radio station WXYZ in Michigan first created and produced &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; show in 1936, with the scripts being written by Fran Striker. The show became so popular it ran for nearly two decades and spun off at least two films. This was Trendle and Striker&#x27;s second big radio hit; their first was &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. 

In the 1936 premiere of the radio program, Kato was presented as being Japanese. By 1939, the invasion of China by the Empire of Japan made this bad for public relations, and from that year until 1945 &quot;Britt Reid&#x27;s Japanese valet&quot; in the show&#x27;s opening was then simply identified by the announcer as his &quot;faithful valet&quot;. The first of Universal&#x27;s two movie serials, produced in 1939 but not released to theaters until early 1940, referred in passing to Kato being &quot;a Korean&quot;. By 1941, Kato had begun to be referred to as Filipino. A long-standing, but false, urban legend maintained that the switch from one to the other occurred immediately after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor. In serials, Kato was played by Chinese-born American actor Keye Luke. In the 2011 film, Kato (played by Taiwanese Jay Chou) tells Britt Reid that he was born in the Chinese city of Shanghai; Reid replies by saying that he &quot;love[s] Japan&quot;.

===Television series===

The televised series of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; was created and produced by William Dozier, the owner of Greenway Productions, for ABC. It ran from September 1966 to March 1967 and was then canceled after that one season. Van Williams played the Green Hornet and Bruce Lee played Kato. Dozier was also the creator of the more popular &quot;Batman&quot; television series. Even though he had the Green Hornet and Kato appear on &quot;Batman&quot; three times, they never acquired a large audience.
It was due in part to Bruce Lee&#x27;s portrayal of this character that the Green Hornet became more well-known, and that martial arts became more popular in the United States in the 1960s. Indeed, Lee refused to follow the American director&#x27;s expectation of fisticuff fights and insisted that he be allowed to use his martial arts skills. They became so popular with the audience that Van Williams, who played the Green Hornet, asked to be taught some moves. In a crossover episode of &quot;Batman&quot; from the same time and companies, Kato has a battle with Robin that ends in a draw (the same thing happens simultaneously with their senior partners). This was in part because Lee refused to participate in a fight that showed Asian-style martial arts being defeated; the original script had the Green Hornet and Kato being beaten by Batman and Robin. The popular impression Lee made at the time is demonstrated by one of the TV series tie-in coloring books produced by Watkins &amp; Strathmore. It is titled &quot;Kato&#x27;s Revenge Featuring the Green Hornet&quot;. &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;&#x27;s success in Hong Kong, where it was popularly known as &quot;The Kato Show&quot;, led to Lee starring in the feature films that would make him a pop culture icon. This show launched Bruce Lee&#x27;s adult television and film career. 

In the TV series, Kato (portrayed by Bruce Lee) is not at all a mechanic but a professional servant, a highly skilled driver, and a master of the art of war. In all other versions of the story, he is also a mechanic, with the creations of both the special automobile, the Black Beauty, and the Hornet&#x27;s trademark sleeping gas and the gun that delivers it attributed to him. In the television series, he also becomes an expert in martial arts, which was implied in the first film serial with his use of a tranquilizing &quot;chop&quot; to the back of a thug&#x27;s neck.

===Comic book adaptations===
All &quot;Green Hornet&quot; comic book adaptations have included Kato. These were produced by Helnit (later Holyoke), Harvey, Dell and, tied into the television version, Gold Key. Beginning in 1989 one, published by NOW Comics, established a continuity between the different versions of the story. In this comic, the TV/Bruce Lee version of Kato is the son of the Kato from the radio stories and has the given name Hayashi as an homage to the character&#x27;s first radio actor.

The comic also establishes a new Kato, a much younger half-sister of the television-based character, Mishi. This female Kato also insists on being treated as the Hornet&#x27;s full partner rather than a sidekick. However, the Green Hornet, Inc., soon withdrew approval and this character was replaced with the 1960s version after Vol. 1, #10. Her removal was explained by having the Kato family company, Nippon Today, needing her automotive designing services at its Zurich, Switzerland facility. Mishi returns in Volume 2, appearing sporadically in the new costumed identity of the Crimson Wasp, on a vendetta against the criminal, Johnny Dollar. She eventually reveals (in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; Vol. 2, #s 12 &amp; 13, August &amp; September 1992) that he had been an embezzling executive at the Swiss plant, whose actions she unwittingly began to expose. Consequently, he had murdered her fiancé and his daughter in an attack that also caused the unknowingly pregnant Mishi, the main target, to miscarry.

In #34, July 1994 issue of that run, she appears in her &quot;Hornet&#x27;s partner&quot; guise one additional time, as the masked Paul Reid attends a gangland meeting; the rules stated that each &quot;boss&quot; is allowed two &quot;boys&quot;. During this period, Hayashi becomes romantically involved with District Attorney Diana Reid, daughter of the original Hornet, who even thinks for a while that she conceived his child. In the final issue, Diana discusses their wedding plans with Mishi. In the last two issues, yet another Kato, a nephew to both of these named Kono, is brought in to allow the aging Hayashi to retire from crime-fighting, but the publisher&#x27;s ceasing of operations prevents much of him being seen. The Bruce Lee-based Kato is also featured in two of his own spin-off miniseries, written by Mike Baron. The first has him defending a Chinese temple, where he studied kung fu, from the Communist government, while in the second he takes the job of bodyguarding a heroin-addicted rock star. A third solo adventure, also by Baron, was announced and promoted first as another miniseries, then as a graphic novel (now subtitled &quot;Dragons in Eden&quot;), but was left unpublished when NOW folded. The line featured one other version of the character.

The three-issue mini-series &quot;The Green Hornet: Dark Tomorrow&quot; (June–August 1993) is set approximately one hundred years in the future, and has an Asian-American Green Hornet, real name Clayton Reid, who is corrupted by power and truly becomes the crime boss he is supposed to only pretend to be, fighting a Caucasian Kato. Beyond the reversal of ethnicities, the latter adds the claim that he and the future Hornet are cousins, and the art&#x27;s depiction of this Hornet&#x27;s unnamed paternal grandparents resembles Paul Reid and Mishi Kato. Although the future Kato is not further identified here, a later &quot;Reid/Kato Family Trees&quot; feature (in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, Vol. 2, #26, October 1993) gives him the first name Luke.

This comic book incarnation gives a degree of official status to a long-standing error about the character, that in his &quot;masked&quot; identity he is known as Kato. The name is restricted to his private persona in the original radio series, the two movie serials, and most of the television version (there are two slips in this last medium, one on the &quot;Batman&quot; appearance, the other in the last filmed episode of the &quot;Hornet&quot; series itself, &quot;Invasion from Outer Space, Part 2&quot;; this story is well out of sync with the rest of the run, and the writer, director, and even the line producer are people with no other credits on the program). But the NOW comic version made a big point of having the masked assistants called Kato, with the woman at one early point telling the equally new Hornet during their first adventure, &quot;While I&#x27;m in this funky get-up, call me Kato. It&#x27;s part of the tradition&quot;.

In the Kevin Smith&#x27;s 2010 revamp of the continuity, Kato is depicted, in modern times, as the elderly but still physically fit valet of the late Britt Reid, killed by a yakuza mobster going by the &quot;Black Hornet&quot; sobriquet. The elder Kato, in this version a Japanese, forced to act Filipino to avoid the suspicions and the racist charges against his people during WWII, retires his identity along with Britt Reid, and both men decide to devote themselves to their families, respectively raising their offspring Britt Reid Jr. and Mulan Kato.

After Britt Reid&#x27;s death, Kato returns in America with Mulan, now the second Kato, to act out the &quot;Secret Testament&quot; of Britt Reid Sr., who wished, in the event of his death, Kato to destroy every Green Hornet paraphernalia still in his possession and whisk Britt Reid Jr. to Japan, for his safety. However, both offspring refuse Reid&#x27;s and Kato&#x27;s will: Mulan Kato, now clad in a close variation of her father&#x27;s original outfit, storms off to confront the Yakuza, and Britt Reid Jr. manages to steal a Green Hornet costume to help her, despite having little training on his own.

As the new Kato, Mulan is a strong, physically fit, silent warrior woman, able to perform amazing feats with uncanny strength and precision. Despite having been shown, in her late teens, as a peppy, lively, cheery &quot;social butterfly&quot;, the adult Mulan Kato is a darker, brooding character who never speaks (despite physically able to do so, Mulan prefers speaking as little as she can to prevent the much talkative Britt Reid Jr., and seemingly everyone else, from talking back) and shows little, if no interest at all, for any form of socialization, a thing that seems to distress the second Green Hornet, every bit the suave socialite his father was.

In addition, the limited series &quot;Green Hornet: Parallel Lives&quot; by writer Jai Nitz, served as a prequel to the 2011 Green Hornet film, exploring the backstory for the film&#x27;s version of Kato.

In 2013, an eight-issue miniseries called &quot;Masks&quot; brought together famous heroes from the pulp era. It stars The Shadow, the Green Hornet, Kato, The Spider and Zorro, and was written by Chris Roberson with art by Alex Ross and Dennis Calero.

===Films===
In 1975, the Chinese-American actor Bruce Li played Kato in &quot;Bruce Lee Against Supermen&quot;.

A 1994 Hong Kong film, &quot;Qing feng xia&quot;, starred Kar Lok Chin as a Kato-like masked hero called the Green Hornet (in English subtitles). In one scene, he is reminded of his predecessors, one of whom is represented by a picture of Bruce Lee in his TV Kato costume..
Sony Pictures announced plans for a feature film of the superhero in 2008. Released on January 14, 2011, the film starred Seth Rogen, who took on writing duties along with &quot;Superbad&quot; co-writer Evan Goldberg. Stephen Chow had originally signed to play Kato, but then dropped out. Taiwanese actor Jay Chou replaced Chow as Kato for the film. In this version, Kato is Chinese and grew up as a poor runaway from his orphanage in Shanghai. He was originally employed by Britt Reid&#x27;s father James as a car mechanic (also making his coffee with a specially-designed machine he had created for the purpose) before joining Britt on the steps that lead to him becoming the Green Hornet as Britt concluded that they had both been wasting their potential. Kato&#x27;s martial art skills in this version of the series are so exceptional that he claims that time literally slows down for him when he gets an adrenaline rush in a dangerous situation, as well as his traditional role as mechanic and driver. Although he and Britt have a temporary falling-out when they argue over their respective importance to the &quot;Green Hornet&quot; concept - Kato acting as the actual action man of the Hornet while Britt is the public face as Kato is too fast for any cameras to see him - they patch up their differences in time to destroy the gang of crime lord Chudnofsky.

In 2016, Paramount Pictures and Chernin Entertainment acquired the rights to The Green Hornet and started preliminary work on developing a reboot with Gavin O&#x27;Connor attached to produce and direct the film and Sean O&#x27;Keefe as writer. In 2020, Amasia Entertainment has gained the rights of the Green Hornet and officially teamed with Universal Pictures for the reboot titled &quot;Green Hornet and Kato&quot;.

The Black Mask is even compared to Kato in one scene. In 2002, it was followed by a sequel, &quot;Black Mask 2: City of Masks&quot; starring Andy On.
* The 2003 film Kill Bill: Volume 1 uses Billy May&#x27;s theme from the 1960s television series in a sequence where the Bride goes to Tokyo in search of O-Ren Ishii. The Crazy 88 wear masks resembling Bruce Lee&#x27;s Kato mask.
* In the film &quot;Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen&quot;, released late September 2010 in Asia and early 2011 in the United States, there is a large feature of the Green Hornet. The subplot consist of the main character Chen Zhen (played by Donnie Yen) dressing up as a mask vigilante (based on Kato) to stop Japanese assassinations and to protect the people. The director has mentioned that since Bruce Lee played both Chen Zhen (in the 1972 film &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;) and Kato (in the 1960s television series The Green Hornet) before, the film was a tribute and dedication to Lee.
* In 2016, Season 6 of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; introduces parody characters of Green Hornet and Kato from 1960s television series in the form of the masked crime-fighter Blue Morpho and his assistant Kano in a flashback, the latter having later become a member of the original Team Venture. It is also revealed that Blue Morpho was the adoptive father of the orphaned villain The Monarch, and he and Henchman 21 later take on the roles of the Blue Morpho and Kano respectively.
* The 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; has a flashback scene in which stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has a confrontation with Bruce Lee (played by Mike Moh in full Kato gear) on the set of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. In the scene, an impromptu two-out-of-three martial arts match between Booth and Lee takes place, with both men winning one match, but the fight is broken up before the deciding match can finish.

<text>Jah Shaka ( – 12 April 2023), also known as the Zulu Warrior, was a Jamaican reggae/dub sound system operator who operated a South East London-based, roots reggae Jamaican sound system since the early 1970s. His name is an amalgamation of the Rastafarian term for God and that of the Zulu king Shaka Zulu.

==Career==
Jah Shaka was born in Clarendon Parish, Jamaica, an area which has produced numerous roots reggae stars, amongst them Toots Hibbert, Everton Blender, Barrington Levy and Freddie McGregor.

Jah Shaka started out on the Freddie Cloudburst Sound System as an operator, before setting up his own sound system. By the late 1970s Shaka&#x27;s system had rapidly gained a large and loyal following due to the combination of spiritual content, high energy rhythms, massive sonority and his dynamic personal style. That following notably included many of the pioneers of post-punk such as Public Image Ltd and The Slits. 
In 1980 Shaka played himself in the film &quot;Babylon&quot; (directed by Franco Rosso, although he directed the scene he appeared in), operating his Sound System in a soundclash at the climax of the story.

Shaka stayed true to his spiritual and distinct musical style during the 1980s when many other Sound Systems had started to follow the Jamaican trend towards playing less orthodox styles tending towards slack dancehall music. In 1989, Shaka visited Jamaica and worked with many musicians there, including King Tubby.

On 23 September 2000, he suffered numerous injuries during a house fire. In 2002, Jah Shaka appeared before a large crowd in New York City&#x27;s Central Park. Live footage of Shaka is featured in the documentary &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; based on the musical festival, which was released in 2009. The Jah Shaka Sound System continues to appear regularly in London, with occasional tours of the United States, Europe and Japan.

==Label==
On his own record label Shaka released music from Jamaican artists such as Max Romeo, Johnny Clarke, Bim Sherman and Prince Alla as well as UK groups such as Aswad and Dread &amp; Fred. He released a number of dub albums, often under the &quot;Commandments of Dub&quot; banner.

Artists featured on more recent releases include both established singers like Tony Tuff, and new emerging artists like Rockaway and Principle - who have sung over riddims produced by his son Malachi, known as Young Warrior.

==Style and influence==
Shaka&#x27;s uncompromising &quot;Warrior Style&quot; has inspired a host of new UK reggae artists and Sound Systems such as Eastern Sher, The Disciples, Iration Steppas, Jah Warrior, Channel One Sound System, Conscious Sounds, 
Aba Shanti-I and Zion Train. Non-reggae artists such as Basement Jaxx have cited Jah Shaka as being their best night out ever.

Jah Shaka events are renowned for attracting a wide audience from all backgrounds, races and ages. His dances attract numbers previously thought unthinkable for this genre of music. Shaka believes it to be a testament to the quality of the message that he expounds in his choice of music and his Rastafarian beliefs. His followers are known to be vocally ardent, and have developed dance steps that resemble African war dances.

Jah Shaka&#x27;s music has had a profound influence on genres in the UK like Junglist, a ghetto style born out of the UK soundsystem culture. Jah Shaka&#x27;s son Young Warrior has now started his own sound system, to great acclaim. Drum and bass is also deeply influenced by Jah Shaka&#x27;s sound system frequencies, and a number of the DJ&#x27;s who feature in that genre, such as Congo Natty frequently name check Shaka&#x27;s sound. Don Letts has also frequently referenced the influence of Jah Shaka on John Lydon and on the punk scene as a whole.

==Non-musical work==
Shaka also established the Jah Shaka Foundation to carry out assistance with projects in Ghana, where the foundation has bought of land in Agri, 30 miles outside of Accra. It has also managed to distribute medical supplies, wheelchairs, library books, carpentry tools, drawing materials and records to clinics, schools and radio stations in the Accra area establishing important links with the local communities. Shaka himself was actually a youth worker years ago, and has regularly been quoted encouraging youths to study geography and history so they know &quot;what&#x27;s happened, where it&#x27;s happening and who&#x27;s doing it&quot;.

==Death==
Shaka died on 12 April 2023, at the age of 75.

<text>Morgan Lewis (October 16, 1754 – April 7, 1844) was an American lawyer, politician, and military commander. The second son of Francis Lewis, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Lewis fought in the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. He served in the New York State Assembly (1789, 1792) and the New York State Senate (1811–1814) and was New York State Attorney General (1791–1801) and the third governor of New York (1804–1807).

==Early life and education==
Morgan Lewis was born on October 16, 1754, of Welsh descent, the second son of Francis Lewis (1713–1802) and Elizabeth (née Annisley) Lewis (1715–1778). Lewis grew up in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, where he decided to dedicate himself to the ministry. However, based on his father&#x27;s advice, he attended the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University, graduating in 1773, and began to study law. He read law alongside John Jay. His studies were interrupted by military service during the American Revolutionary War, but he was admitted to the bar in 1783.

==Career==
===American Revolutionary War===
From September 1, 1776, to the end of the war he was a colonel and the Quartermaster General for the Northern Department.

In 1774, he joined the American Revolution as a volunteer in the Continental Army. Lewis was then made a captain of a regiment of the New York militia. Once the 2nd New York militia regiment was organized, he was promoted to the rank of major. He was then appointed chief-of-staff to General Horatio Gates, with the rank of colonel, and accompanied him into Canada, and soon after congress appointed him quartermaster-general of the Northern Army. In 1775, he planned and executed the night attack on Stone Arabia, and was in command at the battle of Crown Point, where he was accompanied by New York Governor George Clinton. He was prominent throughout the campaign that ended with the surrender of John Burgoyne at Saratoga.

===New York governor===
After the Revolution, Lewis completed his legal studies while he lived in Albany, New York, boarding at the riverside home of James Bloodgood. In 1779, the tax list showed him living there with personal property valued at $2,000, one of the city&#x27;s highest assessments. Later, he qualified for a &quot;bounty right&quot; as a member of the city regiment of the Albany County Militia. During that time, he acquired some Albany property. He was elected to the New York State Assembly, 1789 and 1792, and the New York State Senate from 1811 to 1814. He was New York State Attorney General (December 24, 1791 – October 28, 1801) and later Justice and Chief Justice (October 28, 1801) of the Supreme Court of New York.

He served as governor of New York from 1804 to 1807, defeating Vice President Aaron Burr in the race to succeed George Clinton as governor. In the New York gubernatorial election, 1804, he was largely responsible for splitting the Jeffersonian Republican Party in New York into &quot;Lewisites&quot; (allies of Lewis) and the &quot;Clintonians&quot; (allies of New York Mayor DeWitt Clinton) with his combination of Lewisites (labeled &quot;Quids&quot; by the Clintonians) and Federalists.

During his tenure, the United States Military Academy at West Point was established, the state&#x27;s militia system was restructured, and educational improvements were sanctioned. On April 30, 1807, he was defeated in his run for re-election by Daniel D. Tompkins, also a future vice president. Tompkins received 35,074 votes, and Morgan Lewis received 30,989 votes. He then returned home to Staatsburg, Dutchess County, New York, where he turned his attention to agriculture. Having given up the practice of law, Lewis established a cloth factory, and for several years devoted himself to manufacturing. The failure of a mercantile house to which his goods were assigned caused him to discontinue the business.

===War of 1812===
Prior to the War of 1812, Lewis declined the office of US Secretary of War under President James Madison. Instead, he resumed his duties as Quartermaster General and served in western New York. He was commissioned as a brigadier general on April 3, 1812, and was promoted to major general on March 2, 1813, as part of his service on the Niagara Frontier. He commanded the American forces at the Battle of Fort George. Although the British position was captured, Lewis ordered Colonel Winfield Scott to break off the pursuit of the defeated British troops. But for Lewis&#x27;s overcaution, Scott might have been able to capture Major General John Vincent&#x27;s entire division and greatly weaken the British defense of the Niagara Peninsula. Later, Lewis was appointed as commander of Upstate New York. He procured the release of the American prisoners in Canada, advanced from his private fortune the money for its accomplishment, and rewarded his own tenants who had served in or sent sons to the war by allowing them free rent for the time they served in the army. After the war, Lewis was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815.

Lewis was a presidential elector in the presidential election of 1828.

==Personal life==
In 1779, he married Gertrude Livingston (1757–1833), the daughter of Margaret Beekman and Judge Robert Livingston. They lived in Rhinebeck and then in Hyde Park in Dutchess County, New York. In 1790, his Rhinebeck household was served by eight slaves. Together, Morgan and Gertrude had:

* Margret Lewis (1780–1860), who married Maturin Livingston (1769–1847), a lawyer and politician from New York.

In 1792, Lewis, purchased an estate covering of about 334 acres (135 ha) in Staatsburg, New York, and commissioned the construction of a colonial-style house. In the summer of 1824, on his visit to the United States, the Marquis de Lafayette dined there on his way upriver to visit Lewis&#x27; brother-in-law, Chancellor Livingston.

In 1832, the house was destroyed by a fire, said to be an act of arson committed by disgruntled tenant farmers. After the fire, Lewis and his wife immediately replaced the structure with a Greek Revival mansion with 25 rooms. The house was inherited in 1844 after Morgan Lewis died, by his daughter Margaret and her husband, Maturin Livingston.

==Later life==
Lewis was a Freemason and served as Grand Master in the Grand Lodge of New York from 1830 to 1843. From 1832 to 1835, he was the president of the Historical Society of New York. Lewis was an original member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati and served as its president general from 1839 to 1844. He also helped to found New York University in New York City.

Lewis died in New York City on April 7, 1844.

==Legacy==
The following communities have been named in Lewis&#x27; honor:

* Lewis County, New York, 
* The Town and Village of Lewiston, in New York, 
* The Town of Lewis in Essex County, New York

<doc id="564031" wikidata="Q796188" url="?curid=564031" title="Clydesdale (district)">
<text>Clydesdale (pronounced ; in Scottish Gaelic, ) was a local government district in the Strathclyde region of Scotland from 1975 to 1996. The district was initially called Lanark when created in 1975, but changed its name to Clydesdale in 1980. Clydesdale was an old name for the county of Lanarkshire, one of the historic counties of Scotland. Both the names Clydesdale and Strathclyde reference the area&#x27;s position in the valley (strath or dale) of the River Clyde.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across mainland Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Lanark was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered the whole area of five former districts from the historic county of Lanarkshire:
*Biggar Burgh
*Lanark Burgh
*First District
*Second District
*Third District
The district was initially named &quot;Lanark&quot; after the area&#x27;s main town. The council changed the name to &quot;Clydesdale&quot; in 1980.

The district was roughly conterminous to Lanarkshire&#x27;s historic &#x27;upper ward&#x27;, being its southern part, the largest part in area but more rural and agricultural in character than the &#x27;middle&#x27; and &#x27;lower&#x27; wards which covered the densely-populated industrial towns in and around the lower Clyde Valley and the city of Glasgow.

The district was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. South Lanarkshire council area was formed covering the districts of Clydesdale, East Kilbride, Hamilton, and parts of the City of Glasgow district.

The term Clydesdale continues to be used locally, usually in contexts comparing issues affecting the rural southern territory differently to the more urbanised north, or in names of organisations which focus on the area around Lanark. Four of the multi-member wards used by South Lanarkshire Council since 2007 use the name: Clydesdale East, Clydesdale North, Clydesdale South and Clydesdale West with a combined population of 61,613 in 2019; these roughly correspond to the Clydesdale constituency of the Scottish Parliament established in 1999.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

==Premises==
The council initially used various offices which had been inherited from its predecessor districts. By 1978 it had moved into the converted and extended former St Mary&#x27;s Hospital buildings on South Vennel in Lanark, which had been built in the 1860s. Since the council&#x27;s abolition the building has been an area office for South Lanarkshire Council.

He has the highest career batting average for an Indian test cricketer of 54 but he played his last test when he was just 23 years old. Thereafter, he was only considered for One Day International matches, although his last appearance in that format was also at the young age of 28.

He has appeared as a commentator on various television channels and worked with a Marathi news channel as a cricket expert for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He has also been a part of various reality shows and done a few serials and Bollywood films as an actor. He played a supporting role in the Kannada film &quot;Bettanagere&quot;.

Kambli contributed 349 runs before their coach Ramakant Acharekar forced the pair to declare the innings; he then took six wickets for 37 runs in St. Xavier&#x27;s first innings.

Kambli started his Ranji Trophy career with a six off the first ball he faced. He made his One Day International and Test debuts in 1991 and 1993, respectively.

against Sri Lanka. He is also the only cricketer to hit three
consecutive test centuries in three innings against three
different countries. In his 17 Tests, he averaged 69.13 in the first
innings, and just 9.40 in the second innings, with a difference of
59.73.

He made his ODI debut in 1991 against Pakistan during the Wills
Sharjah Trophy. He played world cup tournaments in 1992 and 1996. He has
2 ODI centuries into his credit: 100 not out against England at Jaipur
in 1993 on his birthday, setting the record for becoming the first batsman to score an ODI hundred on his birthday and 106 against Zimbabwe at Kanpur in the 1996 World Cup.

He played his last Test match at the age of only 23[11]
while he played his last ODI in the year 2000 and formally announced

<text>Glassjaw is an American post-hardcore band from Hempstead, New York. It was formed in 1993 by vocalist Daryl Palumbo and guitarist Justin Beck. The band is known for their intense live shows, as well as their frequent line-up changes. Despite their limited commercial success and small discography, they are considered to be one of the most influential bands in the progression of the underground music scene in the eastern United States and United Kingdom for the post-hardcore genre. 

After recording a number of EPs and demos throughout the 1990s, Glassjaw came to the attention of producer Ross Robinson, who helped the band secure a deal with Roadrunner Records. Robinson went on to produce Glassjaw&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; (2000), which helped the band cement a following in the United Kingdom. After parting ways with Roadrunner following a feud, Glassjaw signed with Warner Bros. Records, who issued the group&#x27;s second outing &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; (2002). The album reached number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and brought Glassjaw to mainstream attention, although its supporting tour was negatively affected by Palumbo&#x27;s struggles with Crohn&#x27;s disease around this time, leading to the cancellation of several dates. Although the group continued to tour semi-regularly, Glassjaw&#x27;s studio activity was sporadic for the rest of the 2000s whilst Palumbo and Beck focused other projects.

After parting ways with Warner Bros., Glassjaw self-released a series of 7&quot; singles throughout late 2010, which were later compiled into the EP &quot;Our Color Green (The Singles)&quot; in January 2011. One month afterwards, the group released another EP, &quot;Coloring Book&quot;. In 2017, Glassjaw released their first album in 15 years, &quot;Material Control&quot;, through Century Media Records. During 2022, the band performed a series of concerts commemorating the 20th anniversaries of the band&#x27;s first two albums.

=== Early years (1993–1998) ===
The band formed in the summer of 1993 after Palumbo and Beck met each other at camp. Of the band name, Beck has said: &quot;We had a list of names, and we were just like, let&#x27;s pick one of these band names which ones the coolest. At the time there were a bunch of bands coming out with two names in one like that, like Mouthpiece, Curbjaw, stuff like that. We were going down the list, and the first name that I liked was Swiftkick. I&#x27;m all like, that&#x27;s a sick name. But for some reason Glassjaw stuck. There&#x27;s really no reason behind it; it just sounded cool.&quot; Upon first founding, the band&#x27;s name was xGlassjawx, which was then followed by the Glassjaw, and eventually simply Glassjaw. The band played their first show in 1994 in Oceanside, New York. In the early days, Beck and Weinstock were also playing with Jewish straight edge metalcore band, Sons of Abraham. Sons of Abraham constitute an important influence on Glassjaw, songs such as &quot;Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)&quot; by Glassjaw drawing particularly on earlier Sons of Abraham releases. Palumbo was in his own straight-edge band called XbustedX. The group&#x27;s line-up changed constantly in their early years while they played in the local New York hardcore scene. Beck&#x27;s primary instrument throughout this time was drums, but switched to bass guitar when Ariel Telford left the band in 1998, and then switched to lead guitar when Kris Baldwin left and Manuel Carrero joined the band in 1999. From 1994 to 1999 the band did several demo recordings of some songs that would eventually appear on their official releases, as well as several other compositions that would not see official release. The band recorded the five-song &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; EP in 1997. The record was released independently on the label 2 Cents a Pop, and saw a re-release in 2001 without label affiliation. The line-up on this record was Daryl Palumbo, Justin Beck, Todd Weinstock, Kris Baldwin and Ariel Telford. &quot;Star Above My Bed&quot;, from the EP, is still in the band&#x27;s set lists to this day. A significant recording came in 1999 working with Don Fury (Quicksand, Snapcase, Orange 9mm, The Hearing Aides), showcasing songs that appeared on their debut LP &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot;.

===&quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; (1999–2000)===
In 1999, the band entered the studio at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California, with producer Ross Robinson (At the Drive-In, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, among others) to record their first full-length album titled &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot;, which saw release in 2000 through Roadrunner Records. On being signed, guitarist Justin Beck said: &quot;Ross showed up at a practice, we start a song; 5-4-3-2-1. Ross stands up, waving his hands and he&#x27;s like, &#x27;It&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s done. I want to do this, you&#x27;ve got a deal! The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck, Todd Weinstock, Manuel Carrero and Sammy Siegler (who left the band prior to the subsequent tour). Robinson has said of it: &quot;Our goal at the time of that record was to destroy Adidas rock&quot;, a self-deprecating reference to the Adidas-sponsored bands (Korn, Limp Bizkit) Robinson had produced and championed as part of the nu-metal movement. The music was aggressive and unrelenting, but also included spacious songs like &quot;When One Eight Becomes Two Zeros&quot;, &quot;Her Middle Name is Boom&quot;, &quot;Piano&quot; and the epic &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot;, the latter of which deals with Palumbo&#x27;s problems with Crohn&#x27;s disease. The music, along with Palumbo&#x27;s lyrics—which were often bitter and resentful towards particular characters he was discussing—and his singing style—powerful and aggressive guttural screaming with a melodic touch—created a unique dynamic. Although &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; is often cited as a milestone post-hardcore album, it saw little push from Roadrunner, making the band disillusioned with the label. Matters were somewhat worsened when Palumbo started to have bouts with his Crohn&#x27;s disease on tour, as his aggressive performance style sometimes triggers a relapse, which has the potential to be fatal. It is alleged that Roadrunner would not allow Palumbo to leave the tour to rest.

Larry Gorman of Orange 9mm officially took over drumming duties partway through touring, which saw dates with Deftones and a six-week European tour with Soulfly. The line-up continued to rotate following the conclusion of the tour when Manuel Carrero was kicked out by Roadrunner for being the only member to have date conflicts with touring.

The album was pressed onto vinyl in 2009, limited to 10,000 copies.

===&quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; (2001–2003)===

In 2001, the band entered the studio in secret with Ross Robinson and began recording their follow-up album &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;, which would see release the following year. The album was engineered and mixed by Mike Fraser. They left Roadrunner in December 2001, finding them problematic, and shopped the album to other labels and ended up signing a deal with Warner Bros. Records. The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck (who also provided bass duties), Weinstock, and Shannon Larkin of Amen and later Godsmack, who provided drumming duties due to recording time constraints, as he had worked well with producer Ross Robinson in the past, although Larry Gorman was composing parts and officially the drummer of the band. Ross Robinson does not use a &#x27;click track&#x27; (automated metronome) when recording drummers, as he believes &quot;it takes away from the true essence of the music&quot;. This album showcased a more melodic and mature Glassjaw, as they started to further incorporate jazz and ambient influences, particularly in tracks like &quot;Ape Dos Mil&quot;, &quot;Must&#x27;ve Run All Day&quot;, &quot;The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports&quot;, and &quot;Convectuoso&quot; (which did not appear on the official release due to a publishing dispute with Roadrunner). Palumbo said of it: &quot;It&#x27;s a mélange of influences, a collage is what this band is all about. This record pays tribute to everything from Bad Brains to Anthrax to The Cure to Squeeze and so much more.&quot; Lyrically, the more confrontational elements heard on &quot;Everything...&quot; were reined in, with Palumbo taking a more cerebral approach.

Dave Allen joined the group as bassist following the recording of the album. The band then toured extensively throughout 2002–2003, playing all over the world, including festival tours such as Warped Tour, Ozzfest and Snocore. In October 2002, dates in Germany and the UK were cancelled when Palumbo was hospitalized in Paris after suffering a relapse of the Crohn&#x27;s; he underwent intestinal surgery. The dates were rescheduled to December, but he suffered another relapse. On their return in April 2003 he was hospitalized again in Glasgow, Scotland, which led to cancellations including the Kerrang! Weekender and a date at the London Astoria.

===Hiatus and rebirth (2004–2008)===
The band took a hiatus in 2004, while Palumbo was composing and performing with his new group Head Automatica—which included drummer Larry Gorman—and Beck worked on his band merchandise business. In late 2004, Todd Weinstock, Dave Allen, and Larry Gorman were all fired from the band, fueling rumors that they had split up. Indeed, the band&#x27;s website displayed &quot;RIP GlassJAw&quot; in the header for a time, though this may have been in jest. The band denied that they were splitting up and cited Palumbo&#x27;s ongoing problems with Crohn&#x27;s disease as one of the reasons for the hiatus.

After a two-year hiatus, the band played three shows in 2005; two at The Downtown in Farmingdale, New York, with proceeds going to charity, and a spot on The Used&#x27;s tour at the &quot;Hammerstein Ballroom&quot;. They were initially meant to be main tour support for The Used, but Palumbo had further problems with his Crohn&#x27;s (Head Automatica also cancelled all their US shows). Manuel Carrero, who had been playing with a band named The Jiant, replaced Allen as bassist after nearly five years away from the group. Durijah Lang, who was also a former band member from their early years, replaced Larry Gorman behind the kit. The band did not fill its vacant guitarist role and continued as a four-piece.

In October 2005 the band released a B-side EP of songs not used on &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;, titled &quot;El Mark&quot;. Their official website became active once again in November 2006. The band would go on to tour in December of that year as support for Deftones, and a few headlining shows of their own (dubbed the &quot;Fucking Tour 2006&quot;). Palumbo said, &#x27;The best thing about the tour was just having it happen&#x27;. Also, on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2006, they played at two-day festival Stillborn Fest in Connecticut, alongside Hatebreed and others. Along with new material was the confirmation that a new album would be released in 2007, with the new songs introduced at the shows included.

Glassjaw&#x27;s official site homepage showed &quot;7.7.7.&quot; in large bold text, referring to a one-off show at the Carling Academy Brixton in England. It was then announced on fan site Glassjaw.net that they would be playing a warm up show at the Camden Barfly on 6.7.7. These shows were the first in the UK for four years. At the end of 2007, Glassjaw, for the first time, headlined in southern California in various venues such as the Avalon in Hollywood, the House of Blues in San Diego, and the Glasshouse in Pomona. This was dubbed the &quot;100% Maybe&quot; tour, a joke referring to the uncertain nature of their tours due to frequent cancellations. The band was one of the headlining acts of 2007&#x27;s Saints &amp; Sinners Festival at the Asbury Park Convention Hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey, along with Against Me!.

In 2008, Glassjaw returned to the UK, playing at the two-day festival Give It A Name in Sheffield on May 10, and in London on May 11. They also did shows in Cardiff, Wales, and Dublin, Ireland.

===&quot;Our Color Green&quot; and &quot;Coloring Book&quot; (2008–2014)===
Glassjaw&#x27;s next release was highly anticipated, not only due to their last full-length release dating back to 2002, but also the delay and lack of information regarding its status and/or release. In an interview with Palumbo in the July 2006 issue of &quot;AP magazine&quot;, he stated that the band were in the process of writing and recording new material for the next album, which they hoped to release in 2007. Palumbo hinted that there could be a unifying concept behind the album.
In November 2007, in the first Glassjaw interview in years, Beck revealed they had written &quot;about eleven good songs -- seven [that] I love, and four to six half-baked ideas we need to finish&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Palumbo stated that the new album should be released by &quot;The end of this year or early 2009...I hope.&quot; Details emerged from &quot;The Grixer&quot; in May 2008 that the album was &quot;awaiting vocals&quot; and &quot;should be wrapped up and completed in the coming months&quot;. In a May 2008 interview with &quot;Verse One&quot; magazine, Beck said: &quot;Right now I’d just be happy to finish up this record. I’m sure if it’s not a giant pile of shit, we’d love to play it live. Exact dates, plans, don&#x27;t know yet.&quot; In a June 2008 interview conducted by Glassjaw.net, Beck stated, &quot;As far as I am personally concerned, there will be a release well before the end of the year.&quot;

The album was not produced by Ross Robinson, as with previous releases; instead Beck co-produced the album with his friend Jonathan Florencio. Florencio also engineered the album. By June 2008, drums, bass, and guitar parts of thirteen songs had been tracked, however vocal tracking was incomplete, with some vocals having been recorded for &quot;You Think You&#x27;re (John Fucking Lennon)&quot;, &quot;Jesus Glue&quot;, the reworked &quot;Star Above My Bed&quot; (based on the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and not Don Fury version), and &quot;Natural Born Farmer,&quot; all of which had been played live and which were expected to be included on the album; however, tracks &quot;Convectuoso&quot; and &quot;Midwestern Stylings&quot; were not included on &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;, despite media reports and announcements at live shows. A fifth, unnamed track had only freestyle vocals recorded, perhaps indicating that lyrics were yet to be written for the rest of the album at this point. It was rumored prior to the official announcement that the album would be self-titled, and Beck hinted, though speculatively, at a possible digital release. He also stated he would have wanted to release the record himself, but it is likely it will be released by Warner Bros., as with &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot;.

In the fall of 2009, Glassjaw supported Brand New on their headline tour. Around the same time, Glassjaw parted ways with Warner Bros. Records due to large corporate shakeups in the company, as well as Palumbo&#x27;s creative differences with the label regarding Head Automatica&#x27;s still-unreleased third album, &quot;Swan Damage&quot;. They were able to take the tracks they had already recorded with them.

In December 2009, it was announced that Manuel Carrero and Durijah Lang left Saves the Day in order to focus entirely on Glassjaw. This made it clear that both Carrero and Lang are not just hired touring musicians and are full-time members.

In January 2010, Glassjaw debuted a new song, entitled &quot;All Good Junkies Go To Heaven&quot; live on their UK tour. The song&#x27;s title was announced by Daryl Palumbo via Twitter some months before. It was the first new song that Glassjaw has played in nearly four years (&quot;Lennon&quot; and &quot;Jesus Glue&quot; were debuted late 2006). In addition, the band also added &quot;El Mark&quot; and &quot;Convectuoso&quot; to their setlists, two fan-favorite B-sides that had been sparingly played live. On the last show of their 2010 tour at Emo&#x27;s in Austin, TX, the band premiered a new song with the tentative title &quot;Wolfegg&quot;.

In August 2010, Glassjaw returned to the UK to headline the Hevy Music Festival held at the Port Lympne Wild Animal Park near Folkestone. Temporary session bassist Sarosh Brohi stepped in for the tour.

To promote an EP consisting of 5 new songs, Glassjaw presented a unique marketing program where fans were offered a free digital release in conjunction with a special limited product or event. Any time a fan bought an item off their online store, included but not mentioned in the package, the fan would get a 2&quot; die-cut plastic logo for free. Other fans received a random postcard in the mail. The postcard had no return label, no explanation and consisted of a perforated logo. On August 8, 2010 (8/8) the band released a 7&quot; vinyl single for &quot;All Good Junkies Go to Heaven&quot; spray-painted green and pink on either side of the vinyl at the UK&#x27;s Hevy Fest. This is the first official Glassjaw release since 2005&#x27;s El Mark EP. On August 8, 2010 via MerchDirect, &quot;All Good Junkies Go To Heaven&quot; became available for purchase. Within hours of availability, the vinyl had sold out. Fans soon realized that in order to play the vinyl, they needed the die-cut logo. Shortly thereafter, in addition to the launch of the single, a &quot;one-take&quot; live video of their 2008 song &quot;You Think You&#x27;re John Fucking Lennon&quot; was posted on the official Glassjaw website. 
Glassjaw then announced the release of another vinyl single for release on September 9, 2010 (9/9) for the song &quot;Jesus Glue,&quot; as well as a digital download for &quot;All Good Junkies Go To Heaven&quot; in various formats.

On September 23, the band posted a video for the song, &quot;Stars,&quot; a reworked version of &quot;Star Above my Bed,&quot; a fan favorite. As they did with &quot;Junkies&quot; and &quot;Jesus Glue,&quot; continuing the date patterns of 8/8, 9/9, on October 10, 2010 (10/10) the band released another vinyl, containing the track &quot;Natural Born Farmer&quot; and the digital release of &quot;Jesus Glue.&quot;

On December 12, 2010 (12/12), Glassjaw released &quot;You Think You&#x27;re (John Fucking Lennon)&quot; on vinyl which instantly sold out. On December 19, an Amazon.com page listing was opened for a Glassjaw EP titled, &quot;Our Color Green (The Singles)&quot; (an allusion to the band&#x27;s first release) with a 1/1/11 release date, all but confirming the rumors of the vinyl tracks being on the aforementioned EP. On December 20, 2010, MerchDirect began selling ticket/poster bundles for Glassjaw shows across the U.S.

On New Years Day 2011, the &quot;Our Color Green (The Singles)&quot; EP was released digitally to online music retailers including iTunes, Amazon, and eMusic among others. The band also encored their 1/1/11 show at the Best Buy Theater in New York with five new songs that Daryl confirmed would be on the bands forthcoming album to be released early in the year.
At 11:11am on January 11, glassjaw.com began streaming a studio recording of &quot;Gold.&quot; The website&#x27;s background was changed to a live band photo with the text &quot;coloring book, the extended play. available exclusively at venue. gratis.&quot; After the first concert on their 2011 tour, February 13, 2011, the new EP &quot;Coloring Book&quot; was given away free to each fan that attended the concert.
Glassjaw played two shows in the UK, at the London HMV Forum (March 30) and the Cardiff Solus (March 31), with support from Napalm Death and also headlined Soundfest (June 10), playing alongside other artists such as Brother Ali, Del the Funky Homosapien and If He Dies He Dies. The band also played the Radio 1 / NME Stage at Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2011.

Glassjaw played their first show of 2012 in support of Rise Against&#x27;s Endgame Tour. It was the only show in which Glassjaw opened for them on the tour. A Day To Remember, The Menzingers, Architects, Touché Amoré, and Title Fight also supported on selected dates. Glassjaw were also added to the Sonisphere festival line-up around this time were to perform Worship &amp; Tribute in its entirety during their set. However, it was announced on March 29, 2012 via Sonisphere&#x27;s website that the festival was canceled due to issues in setting up the festival. As a result, the band scheduled a date at New York&#x27;s Irving Plaza to play the album in its entirety. The band also played Hevy Fest in 2012, alongside acts such as Converge, Rolo Tomassi and Will Haven. It marked Glassjaw&#x27;s second time playing at the festival, and the first since headlining it in 2010. On December 1, 2012 the band played the Unsilent Night Festival in Texas, where they performed a cover of the 108 song &quot;Woman&quot;.

In 2013, the band embarked on a summer headlining tour in the United States. In the fall, the band played Riot Fest in Chicago, as well as an opening for Deftones at a Los Angeles show at the Greek Theater, and also played a headlining show in Santa Ana, California.

At the beginning of 2014, the band participated in the Soundwave Festival in Australia, as well as playing a few Australian club shows with The Dillinger Escape Plan. In the summer of 2014, Glassjaw once again briefly returned to performing, playing a brief set at the Amnesia Rockfest (in Montebello, QC). Later in the fall, the band played Riot Fest in both Denver and Toronto, Made In America Festival in Philadelphia, and Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas, which would be the band&#x27;s last performance with Carrero on bass and Lang on drums.

On the weekend of November 28, 2014, the band&#x27;s merchandise website had a Black Friday sale where fans would get 19.93% off their order if they applied the promo code &quot;weactuallyjuststartedwriting&quot;, hinting that a new album was in the works.

===Line-up change and &quot;Material Control&quot; (2015–present)===
In July 2015 it was confirmed by drummer Durijah Lang that he and bass player Manuel Carrero quit the band in January. When asked for an explanation, Lang reportedly said, &quot;I just felt like I needed to. No axe to grind with those guys. I just ran out of good reasons not to call it a day.&quot; The two went on to join Burn.

Both Lang and Carrero were replaced by two former Glass Cloud members, bassist Travis Sykes and drummer Chad Hasty.

Glassjaw&#x27;s first performance with the newly installed rhythm section was a surprise performance at Amityville Music Hall in Amityville, NY on August 7, 2015. Along with that performance, the band played a handful of performances including Wrecking Ball Festival, Heavy Montreal, Taste Of Chaos Festival, and Aftershock Festival, as well as a show opening for Coheed And Cambria in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and a headline show in San Francisco with Dance Gavin Dance.

On December 1, 2015, Glassjaw released a new song titled &quot;New White Extremity&quot; on the band&#x27;s SoundCloud account. Music news website Pitchfork stated that the band would be releasing a new album, but did not give detail on when the album would be released. 
On January 31, 2016 Glassjaw debuted new material at The Old Blue Last in London. At this warm-up show, they performed &quot;New White Extremity&quot; as well as six other new songs, which they did not name at the time. The following night, February 1, 2016, Glassjaw played at the O2 Ritz in Manchester Theater, again playing more new material including another song called &quot;Shira&quot;.

In February and March 2016, Glassjaw opened for Coheed and Cambria on their &quot;The Color Before the Sun&quot; tour in the United Kingdom and in the United States. During this tour, the band played &quot;New White Extremity&quot; and &quot;Shira&quot;. Also during this tour, they played 7 small headlining shows in nearby cities. At these headlining shows, the band&#x27;s set list contained mostly new songs that have yet to be released. Some of these news songs are speculated to be titled &quot;Neo&quot;, &quot;Metal&quot;, &quot;Post Apocalyptic&quot;, and &quot;Abigados&quot;. The band did not make any other announcements about their oft-rumored third album for nearly two years. However, on May 18, 2016 it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of Riot Fest.

In December 2016, The Dillinger Escape Plan drummer Billy Rymer confirmed that he&#x27;d tracked drums for &quot;a whole album&#x27;s worth of material&quot; towards the band&#x27;s third album.

On November 15, 2017, Amazon leaked a few details of a new Glassjaw album tentatively titled &quot;Material Control&quot;. It was listed with a December 1, 2017 release date containing 12 tracks. A flexi-disc format of the album containing 10 songs was sent to fans who previously had ordered Glassjaw merchandise through Justin Beck&#x27;s MerchDirect company prior to an official announcement.

On November 24, 2017, Glassjaw released a new song titled &quot;Shira&quot; and confirmed a December 1, 2017 release date for &quot;Material Control&quot;. The album was released via Century Media Records to critical acclaim. The music video for &quot;Shira&quot; followed in April 2018.

In April 2018, the band announced a co-headlining summer tour with Quicksand. On June 28, 2018, the band released a music video for &quot;Golgotha&quot;.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s sound has always been rooted in the New York hardcore scene. Elements of the late 1980s youth crew style of hardcore are prominent in their earlier recordings, and Youth of Today have been cited as an important influence. Glassjaw have cited numerous bands as influences, including Bad Brains, Sick of It All, Orange 9mm, Faith No More, Anthrax, the Cure, Squeeze, and Fugazi. Beck has cited Faith No More&#x27;s attitude towards making music as an influence, while Palumbo has specifically cited Mike Patton as a huge influence on him. Glassjaw has been described as nu metal early in their career, alternative metal and post-hardcore.

Apart from this, Palumbo&#x27;s lyrics frequently quote other artists as a tribute, quoting acts such as Frank Zappa, Tori Amos, and Gravediggaz, among others.

RockSound named the band &quot;The Biggest DIY Band In The World&quot; because of the band&#x27;s independence from major labels, insistence on maintaining creative control of both their sound and presentation and grassroots approach to distributing their music despite several hiatuses. On why the band still exists, Palumbo stated, &quot;Glassjaw provides a real outlet for all our creativity. And allows us to sit around making dick and fart jokes all day.&quot; Beck stated, &quot;Glassjaw would suck if this was how we paid our rent because then you&#x27;d make stupid decisions in order to pay the bills. Once money and popularity have a bearing on your art then it&#x27;s gone, diluted. You lose it.&quot;

In a nod to how the band shuns the music industry standard of putting out an album, when asked why the long wait for new music, Palumbo stated &quot;...we write a lot. When the band is at the forefront, that’s when the spark really seems to happen. If it was up to me and him, we’d get together every weekend and make an album almost every few months. But I think the most poignant and potent Glassjaw [comes from] us stockpiling the goodness until it’s time to do it. And when it’s time to do it, the universe very much lets us know.”

==Problems with Roadrunner Records==

Both Palumbo and Beck have been openly vocal about their negative experiences with Roadrunner, and have continued to talk about them years after their departure from the label in December 2001. They openly advise people not to buy their first full-length so as not to give the label money, and have repeatedly told fans at shows to illegally download the record. Palumbo has said of them:

Beck has said:

Palumbo has said that Roadrunner didn&#x27;t put the band on enough tours:
Regarding the re-release of the remastered version of &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; in March 2009 by Roadrunner, Beck was quoted by Alter The Press! in saying:
== Musical influence and legacy ==
Glassjaw have been regarded as one of the most influential bands of the post-hardcore genre. Born of the Long Island hardcore scene, producer Ross Robinson declared in 2000 that Glassjaw &quot;was on a mission to destroy the ‘Adidas Rock’ of nu-metal bands like Limp Bizkit.&quot; Their usage of dissonant melodies through their two guitarists, Justin Beck and Todd Weinstock, created a jazz-like sound that was unique and original for the genre. Nick Greer of Sputnikmusic stated that &quot;part of what makes Glassjaw such a stand out band is a combination of structured genre blending and blissfully naive experimentation.&quot; Michael Ventimiglia of the Long Island Press said that their &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; album &quot;helped shape and define music for a new generation.&quot;

Modern post-hardcore bands such as Funeral for a Friend, Night Verses, The Movielife, The Color Morale and Letlive have named Glassjaw as a formidable influence. Funeral For a Friend lead singer Matt Davies-Kreye stated that &quot;Glassjaw are such an experimental band and integrate a lot of different styles and influences in their music such as ambient rock, hardcore, post-rock and jazz. They always taught me to go against the grain, pay more attention to dynamics and think outside of the box when writing songs. I like to think that our new material is heavily GlassJaw-influenced.&quot; Mike Cunniff of Boston Manor said that &quot;they definitely have a strong cult following not dissimilar to Brand New. Their music has stood the test of time because they have always been so fresh and original.”

<text>The Japanese bush warbler (Horornis diphone), known in Japanese as (), is an Asian passerine bird more often heard than seen. Its distinctive breeding song can be heard throughout much of Japan from the start of spring.

== Description ==
The Japanese bush warbler is olive brown above and tending toward dusky colors below. It has pale eyebrows. It has a beak that curves up making it look like it is smiling. The bird is typically in length.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Japanese bush warbler is a common year-round resident throughout Japan (except Hokkaidō) and the northern Philippines. In summer the Japanese bush warbler can also be found in Hokkaidō, Manchuria, Korea, and central China. In winter, the bush-warbler can also be found in southern China and Taiwan.

It was introduced to Oahu between 1929–1941 and has since spread throughout the main Hawaiian Islands.

In summer, it ranges from low hills to high mountains, preferring bamboo thickets and black pine trees. In winter it seeks cover at lower elevations.

== Relationship to humans==
The propensity of the Japanese bush warbler to sing has led to the birds being kept as cage birds. Robert Young records that to encourage singing the cages of kept birds were covered with a wooden box with a small paper window that allowed only subdued light in. Along with the return of the barn swallow the bush warbler&#x27;s call is viewed by Japanese as a herald of springtime.

It is one of the favorite motifs of Japanese poetry, featured in many poems including those in or . In haiku and , is one of the which signify the early spring. In poetry the bird is associated with the ume blossom, and appears with ume on playing cards. There is also a popular Japanese sweet named (Uguisu Balls) which consists of brown and white balls meant to resemble ume flower buds. However, the distinctive song is not usually heard until later in spring, well after the ume blossoms have faded. In haiku, the bird with this song is known as , and the song is called .

The beauty of its song led to the English name &quot;Japanese Nightingale&quot;, although the Japanese bush warbler does not sing at night as the European nightingale does. This name is no longer commonly used.

An ( = woman) is a female announcer at Japanese baseball games, or a woman employed to advertise products and sales with a microphone outside retail stores. These women are employed because of their beautiful &#x27;warbling&#x27; voices. They are also employed to make public announcements for politicians in the lead-up to elections.

In Japanese architecture there is a type of floor known as , which is generally translated into English as &quot;nightingale floor&quot;. These floors have squeaking floorboards that resemble the Japanese bush warbler&#x27;s low chirping, and are meant to be so designed to warn sleepers of the approach of ninja. Examples can be seen at Eikan-dō temple, Nijō Castle and Chion-in temple in Kyoto.

The nightingale&#x27;s droppings contain an enzyme that has been used for a long time as a skin whitening agent and to remove fine wrinkles. It is sometimes sold as &quot; powder&quot;. The droppings are also used to remove stains from kimono.

== Songs ==
* Pi pi pi... kekyo kekyo Hooo- hoke&#x27;kyo Hoohokekyo. Young Japanese bush warblers do not initially perform the &quot;hoohokekyo&quot; song skillfully, but gradually learn to sing by imitating others in the vicinity.
* Hooo- hokekyo, hooo- hokekyo. The songs of two Japanese bush warblers are recorded here on a single file.
