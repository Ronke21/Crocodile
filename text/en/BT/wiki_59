<text>The Incredible Machine (TIM) is a series of video games in which players create a series of Rube Goldberg devices. They were originally designed and coded by Kevin Ryan and produced by Jeff Tunnell, the now-defunct Jeff Tunnell Productions, and published by Dynamix; the 1993 through 1995 versions had the same development team, but the later 2000–2001 games have different designers. All versions were published by Sierra Entertainment. The entire series and intellectual property were acquired by Jeff Tunnell-founded PushButton Labs in October 2009. PushButton Labs was later acquired by Playdom, itself a division of Disney Interactive, so as of now the rights are held by The Walt Disney Company.

A new game by Jeff Tunnell, called &quot;Contraption Maker&quot;, is the spiritual successor to the &quot;Incredible Machine&quot; series. It was produced by Spotkin Games, a company founded by Jeff Tunnell, and features the same developers of the original &quot;Incredible Machine&quot;. The game was released through Steam for Windows and OS X on July 7, 2014.

==Gameplay==
The general goal of the games is to create a series of Rube Goldberg devices: arrange a given collection of objects in a needlessly complex fashion so as to perform some simple task, such as &quot;put the ball into a box&quot; or &quot;start a mixer and turn on a fan&quot;. Available objects range from simple ropes and pulleys to electrical generators, bowling balls, and even cats and mice to humans, most of which have specific interactions with or reactions to other objects: for example, mice will run towards nearby cheese, and light sources placed next to a magnifying glass will ignite wicks. Levels have a set of fixed objects that cannot be moved by the player, and the player must solve the puzzle by carefully arranging a provided set of objects around the fixed items. There is also a &quot;freeform&quot; option that allows the user to &quot;play&quot; with all the objects with no set goal or to also build their own puzzles with goals for other players to attempt to solve.

Notably, the games simulate not only the physical interactions between objects but also ambient effects like varying air pressure and gravity. The engine does not use a random number generator in its physics simulation, ensuring that the results for any given machine are deterministic.

==Titles==
The series includes four core titles and a &quot;Toon&quot; spin-off, with multiple iterations published of the earliest titles:
*&quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; (1993, DOS/3DO)
**&quot;The Even More Incredible Machine&quot; (1993, DOS/Windows, Macintosh)
*&quot;Sid &amp; Al&#x27;s Incredible Toons&quot; (1993, DOS)
*&quot;The Incredible Machine 2&quot; (1994, DOS/Windows, Macintosh)
**&quot;The Incredible Machine Version 3.0&quot; (1995, Windows/Macintosh)
*&quot;The Incredible Toon Machine&quot; (1994, Windows, Macintosh)
*&quot;Arthur to Astaroth no Nazomakaimura: Incredible Toons&quot; (1996, PlayStation/Sega Saturn)
*&quot;Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions&quot; (2000, Windows/Macintosh)
**&quot;The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions&quot; (2001, Windows/Macintosh/Palm OS)
*&quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; (2011, Apple iPad)

A compilation called &quot;The Incredible Machine Mega Pack&quot; was released in 2009 on GOG.com for Microsoft Windows. It included &quot;The Even More Incredible Machine&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Machine Version 3.0&quot;, &quot;Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions&quot;, and &quot;The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions&quot;.

===&quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; and &quot;Even More Incredible Machine&quot;===

&quot;The Incredible Machine&quot;, the first game in the series, was originally going to be developed by Electronic Arts for the Commodore 64 in 1984, but Dynamix worked on &quot;Arcticfox&quot; for the Amiga instead and work did not start on &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; until early 1993. Kevin Ryan programmed &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot;, in nine months, on a budget of . &quot;The Even More Incredible Machine&quot; is an extended version with 160 levels, about twice the original, and has more parts.

===&quot;The Incredible Machine 2 and 3.0&quot;===

&quot;The Incredible Machine 2&quot; introduced new levels, an extended assortment of parts, a new interface, significantly improved graphics, sounds, and music, and two player hotseat play. It improved on the &quot;freeform&quot; mode, allowing players to create completely playable puzzles by defining not only the participating parts, but also the set of circumstances under which the puzzle will be considered &quot;solved&quot;. In terms of gameplay, this version provided the biggest addition to the series, and subsequent updates were basically only ports of the game to newer operating systems with updated graphics/sounds and sometimes new puzzles, but no new parts.

&quot;The Incredible Machine Version 3.0&quot; (1995), on some releases titled &quot;Professor Tim&#x27;s Incredible Machines&quot;, contains the same levels as &quot;The Incredible Machine 2&quot;, but with an improved interface and extra features like CD music tracks.

===&quot;Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions&quot; and &quot;Even More Contraptions&quot;===

&quot;Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions&quot; was released in 2000. As a full 32-bit Windows 95 game, it has new 800x600 resolution graphics. Although it has a few new levels, the majority of them are levels from &quot;The Incredible Machine 2&quot;.

&quot;Even More Contraptions&quot; (2001) started a service allowing players to share their homemade puzzles using a service called &quot;WonSwap&quot;. &quot;Even More Contraptions&quot; also came with a Palm Pilot version of the game that contained its own unique set of parts and puzzles suited for a small screen.

===&quot;The Incredible Machine Mega Pack&quot;===
Released on GOG.com, &quot;The Incredible Machine Mega Pack&quot; includes &quot;Even More Incredible Machine&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Machine 3&quot; (contains all levels from &quot;The Incredible Machine 2&quot;), &quot;Contraptions&quot;, and &quot;Even More Contraptions&quot;.

===&quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; (2011)===
Released on the iPad in 2011, the game features 64 levels (and 45 more as in-app purchases). It features a similar three-star system as &quot;Cut the Rope&quot;.

==Reception==
Neil Harris reported in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1994 that showing &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; to an engineer friend caused &quot;a chain reaction that brought productive work to a halt at a major naval yard&quot;.

IGN described &quot;Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions&quot; as &quot;a vintage blend of educational and entertainment software at their finest&quot;.

By 2000, the series had sold over one million copies.

During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences honored &quot;Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions&quot; with the &quot;PC Family&quot; award.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions&quot; was included in the 2005 edition of &quot;Hoyle Puzzle Games&quot; as a bonus game.

A mobile phone version was developed by Mobile Interactions Group and published by Vivendi Games Mobile in 2006.

A new game was announced for a download release on Xbox Live Arcade, but was later canceled.

&quot;The Incredible Machine Mega Pack&quot; (which includes &quot;Even More Incredible Machine&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Machine 3&quot;, &quot;Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions&quot;, and &quot;The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions&quot;) was published by Playdom and released on GOG.com on October 1, 2009.

===iOS===
&quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; for iOS is the first version in the series to be developed and released by Disney for the AppStore. This revamped version contains new art, sounds, and levels, as well as a redesigned user interface. Disney released &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; on June 8, 2011, at E3 in Los Angeles, CA. The app has been retired from the app store as a decision made by Disney.

===&quot;Contraption Maker&quot;===
In 2013, Tunnell began the work on a new game, called &quot;Contraption Maker&quot;, which is billed as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the &quot;Incredible Machine&quot; series. Kevin Ryan and Brian Hahn, the other two developers on the original game, worked on &quot;Contraption Maker&quot; as well, along with other developers at Spotkin, a video game development company started by Tunnell.

&quot;Contraption Maker&quot; features improved &quot;HD&quot; graphics, and has a robust physics engine. The game features over 200 official puzzles and over 100 different parts. It also has Steam Workshop support, so users can create and share their own puzzles.

The game was first released on Steam through its Early Access program on August 28, 2013. Throughout its time in the program, &quot;Contraption Maker&quot; had 6 Alpha releases, adding features such as multiplayer and copy-and-paste, new parts, and new puzzles, followed by a Beta release in May 2014. The final (1.0) release was made in July the same year, and &quot;Contraption Maker&quot; left the Steam Early Access program.

<doc id="575225" wikidata="Q1144680" url="?curid=575225" title="Gulf of Morbihan">
<text>The Gulf of Morbihan (, ; ) is a natural harbour on the coast of the department of Morbihan in southern Brittany, France. Its English name is taken from the French version, &quot;le golfe du Morbihan&quot;, though it would be more precisely called &#x27;the Morbihan&#x27; as its Breton name &#x27;Ar Mor Bihan&#x27; means &#x27;the little sea&#x27;. (Compare the Welsh &quot;y môr bychan&quot;), as opposed to the Atlantic Ocean outside, (&quot;Ar Mor Bras&quot;). Legend says that there are as many islands in the Gulf as there are days of the year. In fact the gulf has about 40, depending on the tides. Many islands are private property, except the largest two, Île-aux-Moines and Île-d&#x27;Arz.

The area around the gulf features an extraordinary range of megalithic monuments. There are passage dolmens, stepped pyramids with underground dolmen chambers, stone circles, and giant menhirs, among others. The site best known to outsiders is Carnac, where remains of a dozen rows of huge standing stones run for over ten kilometers. The passage grave of Gavrinis, on a small island in the Gulf, is one of the most important such sites in Europe. Some of the ruins have been dated to at least 3300 BC — 200 years older than England&#x27;s Stonehenge.

==Geography==

===Tides and currents===
The gulf is sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean by the peninsula of Rhuys, but a 1 km long gap between Port-Navalo (in the commune of Arzon) and Kerpenhir (commune of Locmariaquer) lets the water in and out. Because this gap is narrow, the tidal currents are strong and water speeds can reach up to 9.4 knots.

==Festivals==
Every alternate year a yachting festival is held, it is known as &#x27;La Semaine du Golfe Du Morbihan&#x27; celebrating the Brittany&#x27;s culture, music and boating and marine traditions. In 2017, 1,450 boats entered the regatta in addition to the hundreds of spectator craft. The highlight of the festival is a &#x27;Big Parade of Sail&#x27; in which all the boats are displayed en route from Port Navalo to Vannes.

<text>Herrenchiemsee is a complex of royal buildings on Herreninsel, the largest island in the Chiemsee lake, in southern Bavaria, Germany. Together with the neighbouring isle of Frauenchiemsee and the uninhabited Krautinsel, it forms the municipality of Chiemsee, located about southeast of Munich.

The island, formerly the site of an Augustinian monastery, was purchased by King Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1873. The king had the premises converted into a residence, known as the Old Palace (&quot;Altes Schloss&quot;). From 1878 onwards, he had the New Herrenchiemsee Palace (&quot;Neues Schloss&quot;) erected, based on the model of Versailles. It was the largest, but also the last of his building projects, and remained incomplete. Today maintained by the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes, Herrenchiemsee is accessible to the public and a major tourist attraction.

==Old Palace (Herrenchiemsee Abbey)==
According to tradition, the Benedictine abbey of Herrenchiemsee was established about 765 AD by the Agilolfing duke Tassilo III of Bavaria at the northern tip of the Herreninsel. New findings however indicate an even earlier foundation between 620 and 629 by the Burgundian missionary Saint Eustace of Luxeuil, making it the oldest monastery in the Duchy of Bavaria, established some 70 years earlier than St Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Salzburg.

In 969, Emperor Otto I consigned the abbey to the Archbishops of Salzburg. Initially a Benedictine monastery, Herrenchiemsee about 1130 was re-established as a convent of Canons regular living under the Rule of St. Augustine. The construction of a new Romanesque basilica, dedicated to Sts Sixtus and Sebastian, was completed in 1158.

In 1215, with the approval of Pope Innocent III, the Salzburg archbishop Eberhard von Regensburg made the monastery church the cathedral of a suffragan diocese in its own right, the Bishopric of Chiemsee, including several parishes on the mainland and in Tyrol. The Augustinian convent acted as cathedral chapter, while the auxiliary bishops retained their seat at the &quot;Chiemseehof&quot; palace in Salzburg. The Herrenchiemsee chapter was headed by provosts who from 1218 also held the position of an archdeacon. They even obtained pontifical vestments and the right of papal count palatines in the 15th century.

The present-day Baroque monastery complex was erected between 1642 and 1731. In the course of the German Mediatisation, Herrenchiemsee Abbey was secularised in 1803, the cathedral desecrated in 1807, and the Chiemsee diocese finally dissolved in 1808. The island was then sold; various owners demolished the cathedral, sold the interior, and even turned the abbey into a brewery. King Ludwig II of Bavaria warded off plans for the complete deforestation of the island by a Württemberg timber trade company by acquiring it in 1873. He had the leftover buildings converted for his private use, the complex that later became known as the &quot;Old Palace&quot;, where he stayed surveying the construction of the New Herrenchiemsee Palace.

From 10 to 23 August 1948, the representatives of eleven German states of the Western Zones and West Berlin met at the Old Palace as the &quot;Verfassungskonvent&quot; (Constitutional Convention) to prepare the work for drafting the Basic Law (&quot;Grundgesetz&quot;) with a view to the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany.

==New Palace==
===Construction===

In 1867, the young king Ludwig II had traveled to France but had to return to Bavaria when he heard of the death of his uncle Otto, without an opportunity to visit the Palace of Versailles. He nevertheless was concerned with the residence of King Louis XIV and had plans for a similar retreat drafted by his court architect Georg von Dollmann (1830–1895). A possible building site was chosen in the Graswang valley near Ettal, the later site of Linderhof Palace.
After several revisions, Dollmann&#x27;s designs for a former pavilion resembling Grand Trianon or the Château de Marly had grown to a large palace, including a copy of the Versailles Hall of Mirrors. Construction was halted by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. In the following years, Ludwig concentrated on construction of Linderhof. He resumed his former plans after finally visiting Versailles in summer 1874, being received with honors by the French government on his birthday on August 25. Herrenchiemsee became the designated site for the large New Palace around a central &quot;corps de logis&quot;, designed by Dollmann, Christian Jank, and Franz von Seitz.

Construction began on 21 May 1878. Ludwig himself regularly supervised the building progress, while he stayed at the Old Place nearby. Meant as a homage to the adored King Louis XIV and his divine right, Herrenchiemsee arose as a private, yet vast residence, which resembled Versailles but was never designed to host a thousand-head royal household. Ludwig only had an opportunity to stay at the Palace for a few days in September 1885, with a handful of rooms richly decorated and the unfinished parts covered by colorful canvasses.

After the king&#x27;s death in the following year, all construction work was discontinued. During the period between 1863 and 1886, 16,579,674 Marks were spent. Using a 0.2304 troy ounce (7.171 g) 1890 &#x27;20 Mark&#x27; gold coin as a benchmark, this equates to 190,998 oz of gold, which at October 2013 prices was worth approximately £154,000,000 (US$250,100,000), more than the total construction cost of Linderhof and Neuschwanstein Castle together. The expenses brought the royal finances to the verge of bankruptcy, though they had a strong stimulus on the local economy.

Only a few weeks after Ludwig&#x27;s death the building was opened for the public. In 1907 the unfinished North Wing was demolished, whilst the corresponding South Wing was never built. After the November Revolution, Crown Prince Rupprecht ceded Herrenchiemsee to the State of Bavaria in 1923.

===Architecture===

Unlike the medieval themed Neuschwanstein, begun in 1869, the Neo-Baroque New Palace stands as a monument to Ludwig&#x27;s admiration of King Louis XIV of France. Its great Hall of Mirrors&#x27; ceiling is painted with 25 frescoes showing Louis XIV at his best.

The palace was shaped in a &#x27;W&#x27; with wings flanking the central edifice. Only 16 of the 70 rooms were on the ground floor. Though it was to have been an equivalent to the Palace of Versailles, only the central portion was built before the king died and construction was discontinued with 50 of the 70 rooms still incomplete. It was never intended to be a perfectly exact replica of the French royal palace. Like Versailles, the Hall of Mirrors has 17 arches, the Hall of Peace and the Hall of War on either side have six windows each. The window niches at Herrenchiemsee are slightly wider than those at Versailles, making its central façade a few metres wider. The dining room features an elevator table and the world&#x27;s largest Meissen porcelain chandelier. Technologically, the building also benefits from nearly two centuries of progress. The original Versailles palace lacked toilets, water, and central heating, while the New Palace has all of these, including a large heated bathtub.
The palace had been built at a mostly inaccessible spot, in the middle of a forest, on a more or less remote lake island accessible by boat only – today via a system of small steamboats. This location, in defiance of both, an air of &quot;enchantment&quot; around it and the nearby chain of the Chiemgau Alps looming over and reflecting in the lake, may have been and may still be considered clearly less appealing than Neuschwanstein&#x27;s more immediate, thus spectacularly impressive alpine backdrop near Füssen – not to speak of it having been perched right upon the blasted away tip of a steep rock and a quite intimidating gorge instead of a back yard. Not only the exterior, but also the interior at Herrenchiemsee were left even more unfinished than Neuschwanstein&#x27;s. The latter&#x27;s international popularisation, propelled by the inspiration Disney drew from it – say: &quot;Cinderella Castle&quot; – may only have added to the disproportional attention the two venues enjoy with tourists.

Also, seen from Munich, Linderhof is located in the same direction as and not very far away from Neuschwanstein, towards Tyrol and Swabia, so tourists often choose to visit both places within a day trip. Chiemsee with its islands lies on the way to Salzburg, i.e. almost in an opposite direction.

===Gardens===

The formal garden is filled with fountains, a copy of the Versailles Latona Fountain, and statues in both the classical style typical of the gardens of Versailles and the fantastic Romanticism favored by King Ludwig. Statues reminiscent of antiquity are found throughout the gardens, overwrought in the grand style of Richard Wagner&#x27;s romantic operas.

<doc id="575230" wikidata="Q880704" url="?curid=575230" title="Blackbirding">
<text>Blackbirding is the coercion and/or deception of people or kidnapping to work as slaves or poorly paid labourers in countries distant from their native land. The practice took place on a large scale with the taking of people indigenous to the numerous islands in the Pacific Ocean during the 19th and 20th centuries. These blackbirded people were called Kanakas or South Sea Islanders. They were taken from places such as Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Niue, Easter Island, the Gilbert Islands, Tuvalu and the islands of the Bismarck Archipelago amongst others.

The owners, captains, and crews of the ships involved in the acquisition of these labourers were termed &quot;blackbirders&quot;. The demand for this kind of cheap labour principally came from European colonists in New South Wales, Queensland, Samoa, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tahiti, Hawaii, and New Zealand, as well as plantations in Peru, Mexico, and Guatemala. Labouring on sugar cane, cotton, and coffee plantations in these lands was the main usage of blackbirded labour, but they were also exploited in other industries. Blackbirding ships began operations in the Pacific from the 1840s which continued into the 1930s. Blackbirders from the Americas sought workers for their haciendas and to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands, while the blackbirding trade organised by colonists in places like Queensland, Fiji, and New Caledonia used the labourers at plantations, particularly those producing sugar cane.

Examples of blackbirding outside the South Pacific include the early days of the pearling industry in Western Australia at Nickol Bay and Broome, where Aboriginal Australians were blackbirded from the surrounding areas. Chinese men were blackbirded from Amoy in the 1840s and 50s to work as unskilled labourers in the pearling, gold and farming industries.

Practices similar to blackbirding continue to the present day. One example is the kidnapping and coercion, often at gunpoint, of indigenous peoples in Central America to work as plantation labourers in the region. They are subjected to poor living conditions, are exposed to heavy pesticide loads, and do hard labour for very little pay.

== Australia ==
=== New South Wales ===
The first major blackbirding operation in the Pacific was conducted out of Twofold Bay in New South Wales. A shipload of 65 Melanesian labourers arrived in Boyd Town on 16 April 1847 on board &quot;Velocity&quot;, a vessel under the command of Captain Kirsopp and chartered by Benjamin Boyd. Boyd was a Scottish colonist who wanted cheap labourers to work at his large pastoral leaseholds in the colony of New South Wales. He financed two more procurements of South Sea Islanders, 70 of which arrived in Sydney in September 1847, and another 57 in October of that same year. Many of these Islanders soon absconded from their workplaces and were observed starving and destitute on the streets of Sydney. Reports of violence, kidnap and murder used during the recruitment of these labourers surfaced in 1848 with a closed-door enquiry choosing not to take any action against Boyd or Kirsopp. The experiment of exploiting Melanesian labour was discontinued in Australia until Robert Towns recommenced the practice in Queensland when he fitted out the schooner &quot;Don Juan&quot; and, in August 1863, despatched her on a recruiting voyage under the command of Captain Greuber.

=== Queensland ===

The Queensland labour trade in South Sea Islanders, or Kanakas as they were commonly termed, was in operation from 1863 to 1908, a period of 45 years. Some 55,000 to 62,500 were brought to Australia, most being recruited or blackbirded from islands in Melanesia, such as the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), the Solomon Islands and the islands around New Guinea. Although the process of acquiring these indentured labourers varied from violent kidnapping at gunpoint to relatively acceptable negotiation, most of the people affiliated with the trade were regarded as blackbirders. The majority of those taken were male and around one quarter were under the age of sixteen. In total, approximately 15,000 Kanakas died while working in Queensland, a figure which does not include those who died in transit or who were killed in the recruitment process. This represents a mortality rate of at least 30%, which is high considering most were only on three year contracts. It is also similar to the estimated 33% death rate of enslaved Africans in the first three years of being taken to America.

==== Robert Towns and the first shipments ====

In 1863, Robert Towns, a British sandalwood and whaling merchant residing in Sydney, wanted to profit from the world-wide cotton shortage due to the American Civil War. He bought a property he named Townsvale on the Logan River south of Brisbane, and planted of cotton. Towns wanted cheap labour to harvest and prepare the cotton and decided to import Melanesian labour from the Loyalty Islands and the New Hebrides. Captain Grueber together with labour recruiter Henry Ross Lewin aboard &quot;Don Juan&quot;, brought 67 South Sea Islanders to the port of Brisbane on 17 August 1863. Towns specifically wanted adolescent males. Recruitment and kidnapping were reportedly employed in obtaining these boys. Over the following two years, Towns imported around 400 more Melanesians to Townsvale on one to three year terms of labour. They came on &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; (Captain Archer Smith) and &quot;Black Dog&quot; (Captain Linklater). In 1865, Towns obtained large land leases in Far North Queensland and funded the establishment of the port of Townsville. He organised the first importation of South Sea Islander labour to that port in 1866. They came aboard &quot;Blue Bell&quot; under Captain Edwards. Towns paid his Kanaka labourers in trinkets instead of cash at the end of their working terms. His agent claimed that blackbirded labourers were &quot;savages who did not know the use of money&quot; and therefore did not deserve cash wages. Apart from a small amount of Melanesian labour imported for the beche-de-mer trade around Bowen, Robert Towns was the primary exploiter of blackbirded labour up until 1867, when Captain Whish, formerly an officer in H.M. Light Dragoons and subsequently the owner of a plantation near Brisbane was a leading exploiter of Melanesian labour. Captain Louis Hope applied Melanesian labour to his twenty acres of sugar cane at Ormiston, Queensland, and later on his farm near the Coomera River. By 1868, the extent of the cultivation of sugar cane exceeded that of cotton; which increased the demand for labour. Licences for recruiting ship were issued by Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, as well as Fiji.

==== Expansion of labour recruitment for Queensland ====
The high demand for very cheap labour in the sugar and pastoral industries of Queensland, resulted in Towns&#x27; main labour recruiter, Henry Ross Lewin, and another recruiter by the name of John Crossley opening their services to other land-owners. In 1867, &quot;King Oscar&quot;, &quot;Spunkie&quot;, &quot;Fanny Nicholson&quot; and &quot;Prima Donna&quot; returned with close to 1,000 Kanakas who were offloaded in the ports of Brisbane, Bowen and Mackay. This influx, together with information that the recently arrived labourers were being sold for £2 each and that kidnapping was at least partially used during recruitment, raised fears of a burgeoning new slave trade. These fears were realised when French officials in New Caledonia complained that Crossley had stolen half the inhabitants of a village in Lifou, and in 1868 a scandal evolved when Captain McEachern of &quot;Syren&quot; anchored in Brisbane with 24 dead islander recruits and reports that the remaining ninety on board were taken by force and deception. Despite the controversy, no action was taken against McEachern or Crossley.

Many members of the Queensland government were already either invested in the labour trade or had Kanakas actively working on their land holdings. Therefore, the 1868 legislation on the trade in the form of the Polynesian Labourers Act of the Queensland parliament, that was brought in due to &quot;Syren&quot; debacle, requiring every ship to be licensed and carry a government agent to observe the recruitment process, was poor in protections and even more poorly enforced. Government agents were often corrupted by bonuses paid for labourers &#x27;recruited,&#x27; or blinded by alcohol, and did little or nothing to prevent sea-captains from tricking islanders on-board or otherwise engaging in kidnapping with violence. The Act also stipulated that the Kanakas were to be contracted for no more than 3 years and be paid £18 for their work. This was an extremely low wage that was only paid at the end of their three years of work. Additionally, a system whereby the Islanders were heavily influenced to buy overpriced goods of poor quality at designated shops before they returned home, robbed them further. The Act, instead of protecting the South Sea Islanders, actually gave legitimacy to a kind of slavery in Queensland.

==== The Kanaka trade in the 1870s ====

Recruiting of South Sea Islanders soon became an established industry with labour vessels from across eastern Australia obtaining Kanakas for both the Queensland and Fiji markets. Captains of such ships would get paid about 5 shillings per recruit in &quot;head money&quot; incentives, while the owners of the ships would sell the Kanakas from anywhere between £4 and £20 per head. The Kanakas who were transported on &quot;Bobtail Nag&quot; had metal discs imprinted with a letter of the alphabet hung around their neck making for easy identification. Maryborough and Brisbane became important centres for the trade with vessels such as &quot;Spunkie&quot;, &quot;Jason&quot; and &quot;Lyttona&quot; making frequent recruiting journeys out of these ports. Reports of blackbirding, kidnap and violence were made against these vessels with Captain Winship of &quot;Lyttona&quot; being accused of kidnapping and importing Kanaka boys aged between 12 and 15 years for the plantations of George Raff at Caboolture. The Queensland Governor made enquiries and &quot;found that there were a few islanders between fourteen and sixteen years of age, but that they, like all the others who accompanied them, had engaged without any pressure and were perfectly happy and contented&quot;. It was alleged by missionaries in the New Hebrides that one crew member of &quot;Spunkie&quot; murdered two recruits by shooting them, but the immigration agent Charles James Nichols who was on board the vessel denied this occurred. Charges of kidnap were made against Captain John Coath of &quot;Jason&quot;. Only Captain Coath was brought to trial and, despite being found guilty, he was soon pardoned and allowed to re-enter the recruiting trade. Up to 45 of the Kanakas brought in by Coath died on plantations around the Mary River. Meanwhile, the famous recruiter Henry Ross Lewin was charged with the rape of a pubescent Islander girl. Despite strong evidence, Lewin was acquitted and the girl was later sold in Brisbane for £20.

By the 1870s, South Sea Islanders were being put to work not only in cane-fields along the Queensland coast but were also widely used as shepherds upon the large sheep stations in the interior and as pearl divers in the Torres Strait. They were taken as far west as Hughenden, Normanton and Blackall. In 1876, several Islanders died, one by scurvy, on the 800 km journey they were required to make from Rockhampton to Bowen Downs Station. No police report was made and the overseer in charge was only fined £10. Whipping of the Islander labourers was found to be occurring across a number of districts including at the Ravensbourne sheep station, and at the coastal sugar plantations of Nerada and Magnolia owned by Hugh Monckton and Colonel William Feilding respectively. Fatal conflict with the landholders was at times evident, for instance a group of South Sea Islanders murdered Mr Gibbie and Mr Bell, owners of Conway station. One, possibly two of the labourers were shot by Gibbie, while the others were captured by Native Police, one dying while in their custody. When the owners of the properties went bankrupt, the Islanders would often either be abandoned or sold as part of the estate to a new owner. In the Torres Strait, Kanakas were left at isolated pearl fisheries such as the Warrior Reefs for years with little hope of being returned home. In this region, three ships used to procure pearl-shells and beche-de-mer, including &quot;Challenge&quot; were owned by James Merriman who held the position of Mayor of Sydney.

Poor conditions at the sugar plantations led to regular outbreaks of disease and death. The Maryborough plantations and the labour vessels operating out of that port became notorious for high mortality rates of Kanakas. During the measles epidemic of 1875, ships such as &quot;Jason&quot; arrived with Islanders either dead or infected with the disease. There were 30 deaths recorded of measles, followed by dysentery. From 1875 to 1880, at least 443 Kanakas died in the Maryborough region from gastrointestinal and pulmonary disease at a rate 10 times above average. The Yengarie, Yarra Yarra and Irrawarra plantations belonging to Robert Cran were particularly bad. An investigation revealed that the Islanders were overworked, underfed, not provided with medical assistance and that the water supply was a stagnant drainage pond. At the port of Mackay, the labour schooner &quot;Isabella&quot; arrived with half the Kanakas recruited dying on the voyage from dysentery, while Captain John Mackay (after whom the city of Mackay is named), arrived at Rockhampton in &quot;Flora&quot; with a cargo of Kanakas, of which a considerable number were in a dead or dying condition.

As the blackbirding activities increased and the detrimental results became more understood, resistance by the Islanders to this recruitment system grew. Labour vessels were regularly repelled from landing at many islands by local people. Recruiter, Henry Ross Lewin, was killed at Tanna Island, the crew of &quot;May Queen&quot; were killed at Pentecost Island, while the captain and crew of &quot;Dancing Wave&quot; were killed at the Nggela Islands. Blackbirders would sometimes make their vessels look like missionary ships, deceiving then kidnapping local Islanders. This led to violence against the missionaries themselves, the best example being the killing of Anglican missionary John Coleridge Patteson in 1871 at Nukapu. A few days before his death, one of the local men had been killed and five others abducted by crew of &quot;Margaret Chessel&quot; who pretended to be missionaries. Patteson may also have been killed due to his desire to take the Islanders&#x27; children to a distant mission school and that he had disrupted the local patriarchal hierarchy. At other islands blackbirding vessels, such as &quot;Mystery&quot; under Captain Kilgour, attacked villages, shooting the residents and burning their houses. Ships of the Royal Navy were also called upon to investigate the deeds and deliver appropriate punishment upon islands involved in killings of blackbirding crews and missionaries. For example, HMS Rosario in 1871 whilst investigating the Bishop Patteson murder and other conflicts between islanders, settlers and missionaries as the Commander describes in his book. And later under Captain de Houghton and under Commodore John Crawford Wilson conducted several missions in the late 1870s that involved naval bombardment of villages, raids by marines, burning of houses, destruction of crops and the hanging of an Islander from the yardarms. One of these expeditions involved the assistance of the armed crew of the blackbirding vessel &quot;Sybil&quot; commanded by Captain Satini. Furthermore, two South Sea Islanders were hanged in Maryborough for the rape and attempted murder of a white woman, these being the first legal executions in that town.

==== The &quot;Pacific Islanders Protection Act&quot; 1872 &amp; 1875 of the United Kingdom ====
In 1872, the United Kingdom passed legislation in an attempt to control the coercive labour recruitment practices in the South Pacific Ocean: the &quot;Pacific Islanders Protection Act&quot; 1872 (the principal Act), which was amended by the &quot;Pacific Islanders Protection Act&quot; 1875. The principal Act provided for the Governor of one of the Australian colonies to have the authority to licence British vessels in the South Pacific Ocean to carry &quot;native labourers&quot;. The 1875 Act amended that licensing system and stated that any &quot;British vessel may, under the principal Act, be detained, seized, and brought in for adjudication by any officer, all goods and effects found on board such vessel may also be detained, seized, and brought in for adjudication by such officer, either with or without such vessel&quot; with the &quot;High Court of Admiralty of England and every Vice-Admiralty Court in Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions out of the United Kingdom shall have jurisdiction to try and condemn as forfeited to Her Majesty or restore any vessel, goods, and effects alleged to be detained or seized in pursuance of the principal Act or of this Act&quot;. The 1875 Act also provided authority for &quot;Her Majesty to exercise power and jurisdiction over Her subjects within any islands and places in the Pacific Ocean not being within Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions, nor within the jurisdiction of any civilized power, in the same and as ample a manner as if such power or jurisdiction had been acquired by the cession or conquest of territory&quot;, although the 1875 Act did not specify any Pacific islands to which this authority was to be applied.

The 1872 &amp; 1875 Acts were intended to work in conjunction with the &quot;British Slave Trade Act&quot; 1839 to provide the authority to arrest blackbirding ships, and charge their captains and owners with slavery charges. However, this approach to suppressing blackbirding was not successful.

In 1869, a vessel of the Royal Navy based at the Australia Station in Sydney, was sent to suppress the blackbirding trade. , under Captain George Palmer, managed to intercept a blackbirding ship loaded with Islanders at Fiji. under command of Captain Daggett and licensed in Queensland to Henry Ross Lewin, was described by Palmer as being fitted out &quot;like an African slaver&quot;. Even though there was a government agent on board, the Kanakas on board the &quot;Daphne&quot; appeared in poor condition and, having no understanding of English and no interpreter, had little idea of why they were being transported. Palmer seized the ship, freed the Kanakas and arrested both Captain Daggett and the ship&#x27;s owner Thomas Pritchard for slavery. Daggett and Pritchard were taken to Sydney to be tried but all charges were quickly dismissed and the prisoners discharged. Furthermore, Sir Alfred Stephen, the Chief Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court found that Captain Palmer had illegally seized &quot;Daphne&quot; and ordered him to pay reparations to Daggett and Pritchard. No evidence or statements were taken from the Islanders. This decision, which overrode the obvious humanitarian actions of a senior officer of the Royal Navy, gave further legitimacy to the blackbirding trade out of Queensland and allowed it to flourish. It also constrained the actions by naval commanders when dealing with incidents on the high seas and also crimes against the many missionaries working on the islands.

==== Early 1880s: resistance to the blackbirders intensifies ====
The violence and death surrounding the Queensland blackbirding trade intensified in the early 1880s. Local communities in the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands had increased access to modern firearms which made their resistance to the blackbirders more robust. Well known vessels that experienced mortality amongst their crews while attempting to recruit Islanders included &quot;Esperanza&quot; at Simbo, &quot;Pearl&quot; at Rendova Island, &quot;May Queen&quot; at Ambae Island, &quot;Stormbird&quot; at Tanna, &quot;Janet Stewart&quot; at Malaita and &quot;Isabella&quot; at Espiritu Santo amongst others. Officers of Royal Navy warships attempting punitive action were not exempt as targets with Lieutenant Bower and five crew of being killed in the Nggela Islands and Lieutenant Luckcraft of being shot dead at Espiritu Santo. Numerous punitive expeditions were carried out by Royal Navy warships based at the Australia Station. under Captain William Maxwell went on an extensive punitive expedition, shelling and destroying about 33 villages, while marines of executed various Islanders suspected of killing white men. Captain Dawson of led a mission to Ambae Island, killing a chief suspected of murdering blackbirders, while went on a &quot;savage-hunting expedition&quot; throughout the Solomon Islands which resulted in no casualties on either side. At Ambrym, the marines of under Commander Moore, raided and burned down a village in retaliation for the killing of Captain Belbin of the blackbirding ship &quot;Borough Belle&quot;. Likewise, patrolled the islands, protecting the crews of blackbirding vessels such as &quot;Ceara&quot; from mutinies of the labour recruits.

==== &quot;The Age&quot; 1882 slave trade exposé ====
In 1882, the Melbourne newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; published an eight-part series written by journalist and future physician George E. Morrison, who had sailed, undercover, for the New Hebrides, while posing as crew of the brigantine slave ship, &quot;Lavinia&quot;, as it made cargo of Kanakas. &quot;A Cruise in a Queensland Slaver. By a Medical Student&quot; was written in a tone of wonder, expressing &quot;only the mildest criticism&quot;; six months later, Morrison &quot;revised his original assessment&quot;, describing details of &quot;Lavinia&quot; blackbirding operation, and sharply denouncing the slave trade in Queensland. His articles, letters to the editor, and &quot;The Age&quot; editorials, led to expanded government intervention.

==== Mid 1880s: Shifting of recruitment from the New Guinea islands ====
The usual recruiting grounds of the New Hebrides and Solomon Islands became too dangerous and too expensive to obtain labour from. However, the well-populated islands around New Guinea were soon targeted for recruiting as these people were less aware of the blackbirding system and had less access to firearms. A new rush for labour from these islands began, with James Burns and Robert Philp of Burns Philp &amp; Co. purchasing several well-known blackbirding ships to quickly exploit the human resource in this region. Plantation owners such as Robert Cran also bought vessels and made contact with missionaries like Samuel MacFarlane in the New Guinea area to help facilitate the acquisition of cheap workers. Kidnapping, forced recruitment, killings, false payment and the enslavement of children was again the typical practice. Captain William T. Wawn, a famous blackbirder working for the Burns Philp company on the ship &quot;Lizzie&quot;, freely acknowledged in his memoirs that he took boatloads of young boys with no information given about contracts, pay or the nature of the work. Up to 530 boys were recruited per month from these islands, most of whom were transported to the new large company plantations in Far North Queensland, such as the Victoria Plantation owned by CSR. This phase of the trade was very profitable, with Burns Philp selling each recruit for around £23. Many of them could not speak any English and died on these plantations at a rate of up to 1 in every 5 from disease, violence and neglect.

In April 1883, the Premier of Queensland, Thomas McIlwraith attempted to annex New Guinea to be part of Queensland. This was rejected by the British Colonial Secretary mostly because of fears that it would expose even more of its inhabitants to be forcibly taken to work and possibly die in Queensland. The large influx of New Guinea labourers also sparked concern from white supremacist anti-immigration groups, which led to the election in late 1883 of Samuel Griffith on an anti-Kanaka policy platform. Griffith quickly banned recruitment from the New Guinea islands and spearheaded a number of high-profile criminal cases against blackbirding crews operating in the area. The crew of &quot;Alfred Vittery&quot; were charged with the murder of South Sea Islanders, while Captain Joseph Davies of &quot;Stanley&quot;, Captain Millman of &quot;Jessie Kelly&quot;, Captain Loutit of &quot;Ethel&quot; as well as the owners of &quot;Forest King&quot; were all charged with kidnapping. All of these cases, despite strong evidence against them, resulted in acquittal. Charges of neglect resulting in death against plantation managers were also made. For example, Mr Melhuish of the Yeppoon Sugar Plantation was tried, but even though he was found responsible, the judge involved imposed only the minimum £5 fine and wished it could be an even lesser amount. During a riot at the Mackay racetrack, several South Sea Islanders were beaten to death by mounted white men wielding stirrup irons. Only one man, George Goyner, was convicted and received a minor punishment of two months imprisonment.

==== The &quot;Hopeful&quot; case, Royal Commission and planter compensation ====
In 1884, in one specific case, a significant judicial punishment was imposed on the blackbirders. This was in regards to the crew of &quot;Hopeful&quot; vessel which was owned by Burns Philp. Captain Lewis Shaw and four crew were charged and convicted of kidnapping people from the Bismarck Archipelago, while the recruiter Neil McNeil and the boatswain were charged and convicted of murdering a number of Islanders. The kidnappers received jail terms of 7 to 10 years, while McNeil and the boatswain were sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment. Despite evidence showing that at least 38 Islanders had been killed by &quot;Hopeful&quot; crew, all the prisoners (except for one who died in jail) were released in 1890 in response to a massive public petition signed by 28,000 Queenslanders. This case sparked a Royal Commission into the recruitment of Islanders from which the Premier of Queensland concluded that it was no better than the African slave trade, and in 1885 the vessel S.S. &quot;Victoria&quot; was commissioned by the Government of Queensland to return 450 New Guinea Islanders to their homelands. Just like the global slave trade, the plantation owners, instead of being held criminally responsible, were financially compensated by the government for the loss of these returned workers. 
Fourteen sugar companies and individual planters including The Colonial Sugar Refining Company and David Adolphus Louis, took the Queensland Government to court to demand financial recompense and were collectively awarded £18,500. This is despite consistent evidence given in court of each plantation recording labourer death rates of up to 60% over the term of their servitude.

==== The later years of recruiting ====
Forceful recruitment of South Sea Islanders persisted in the New Guinea region, as well as in the Solomons and the New Hebrides islands, as did the high death rates of these labourers at Queensland plantations. At the Yeppoon Sugar Company, deliberate poisonings of Kanakas also occurred and when this plantation was later put up for sale, the Islander labourers were included as part of the estate. Resistance and conflict also continued. For instance, at Malaita six crew members of the recruiting vessel &quot;Young Dick&quot; were killed together with about six islanders in a skirmish, The boat crew of the labour recruiting schooner &quot;Mystery&quot; were killed in November 1878 at Longana, a district on the island of Ambae, Vanuatu (New Hebrides). Then in 1888 at Paama a large gun battle between the residents and the crew of &quot;Eliza Mary&quot; occurred. This ship later sank during a cyclone causing the drowning deaths of 47 Kanakas. The policy of extensive punitive expeditions carried out by the Royal Navy against the Islanders persisted as well. The official report of the lengthy mission of which bombarded and burnt numerous villages in 1885 was kept secret. also bombarded numerous villages in punitive expeditions which elicited condemnation from some sections of the media.

Legislation was passed to end the South Sea Islander labour trade in 1890 but it was not effectively enforced and it was officially recommenced in 1892. Reports such as those by Joe Melvin, an investigative journalist who in 1892 joined the crew of Queensland blackbirding ship &quot;Helena&quot; and found no instances of intimidation or misrepresentation and concluded that the Islanders recruited did so &quot;willingly and cannily&quot;, helped the plantation owners secure the resumption of the trade. &quot;Helena&quot; under Captain A.R. Reynolds, transported Islanders to and from Bundaberg and in this region there was a very large mortality rate of Kanakas in 1892 and 1893. South Sea Islanders made up 50% of all deaths in this period even though they only made up 20% of the total population in the Bundaberg area. The deaths were due to the hard manual labour and diseases such as dysentery, influenza and tuberculosis.

In the 1890s, other important recruiting vessels were &quot;Para&quot;, &quot;Lochiel&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot;, &quot;Rio Loge&quot;, &quot;Roderick Dhu&quot; and &quot;William Manson&quot;. Joseph Vos, a well known blackbirder for many years and the captain of &quot;William Manson&quot;, would use phonographic recordings and enlarged photographs of relatives of Islanders to induce recruits on board his vessel. Vos and his crew were involved in killings, stealing women and setting fire to villages and were charged with kidnapping. However, they were found not guilty and released. &quot;Roderick Dhu&quot;, a vessel owned by the sugar magnate Robert Cran, was another ship regularly involved in blackbirding investigations and conflict with Islanders. In 1890, it was involved in the shooting of people at Ambae Island, and evidence of kidnapping by the crew was later published. In 1893, conflict with Islanders at Espiritu Santo resulted in the death of a crew member of &quot;Roderick Dhu&quot;.

==== Repatriation ====
In 1901, the government of the newly federated British colonies of Australia legislated the &quot;Regulation, Restriction and Prohibition of the Introduction of Labourers from the Pacific Islands&quot; bill, better known as the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901. This Act, which was part of a larger White Australia policy, made it illegal to import South Sea Islanders after March 1904 and mandated for the forcible deportation of all Islanders from Australia after 1906. Strong lobbying from Islander residents in Australia forced some exemptions to be made, for example, those who were married to an Australian, who owned land or who had been living for 20 years in Australia were exempt from compulsory repatriation. However, many Islanders were not made aware of these exemptions. Around 4000 to 7500 were deported in the period 1906 to 1908, while approximately 1600 remained in Australia. The Burns Philp company won the contract to deport the Islanders and those taken back to the Solomon Islands were distributed to their home islands by vessels of Lever&#x27;s Pacific Plantations company. Deported Solomon Islanders who were unable to go to their villages of origin or who were born in Australia, were often put to work in plantations in these islands. In some localities, serious conflict between these workers and white colonists in the Solomon Islands ensued. Around 350 of the South Sea Islanders banished from Queensland were transferred to plantations in Fiji. At least 27 of these died while being transported.
Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as Australian South Sea Islanders. A 1992 census of Australian South Sea Islanders reported around 10,000 descendants living in Queensland. In the 2016 census, 6830 people in Queensland declared that they were descendants of South Sea Islander labourers.

==== Seasonal workers in the 21st century ====
In 2012, the Australian government introduced a seasonal worker scheme under the 416 and 403 visas to bring in Pacific Islander labour to work in the agricultural industry performing tasks such as picking fruit. By 2018, around 17,320 Islanders, mostly from Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga, had been employed with the majority being placed on farms in Queensland. Workers under this programme have often been subject to working long hours in extreme temperatures and being forced to live in squalid conditions. Poor access to clean water, adequate food and medical assistance has resulted in several deaths. These reports, together with allegations of workers receiving as little as $10 a week after rent and transport deductions, resulted in the &quot;Harvest Trail Inquiry&quot; into the conditions of migrant horticultural workers. This inquiry confirmed widespread exploitation, intimidation and underpayment of workers with at least 55% of employers being non-compliant in regard to payments and conditions. It found many workers were contracted under a &quot;piece rate&quot; of pay with no written agreement and no minimum hourly rate (as is typical for Australian seasonal agricultural workers). Even though some wages were recovered and a number of employers and contractors were fined, the inquiry found that much more regulation was needed. Despite this report, the government expanded the programme in 2018 with the Pacific Labour Scheme which includes three-year contracts. Strong parallels have been drawn with the working conditions observed under this programme to those of blackbirded Pacific Islander labourers in the 19th Century.

The introduction of the &quot;Modern Slavery Act 2018&quot; into Australian law was partly based upon concerns of slavery being evident in the Queensland agricultural sector. Some commentators have also drawn parallels between blackbirding and the early 21st-century recruitment of labour under the (unconnected) 457 visa scheme.

=== Western Australia ===
The early days of the pearling industry in Western Australia at Nickol Bay and Broome, saw Aboriginal Australians blackbirded from the surrounding areas. After settlement the Aborigines were used as slave labour in the emerging commercial industry.

During the early 1870s, Francis Cadell became involved in whaling, trading, pearling and blackbirding in North-West Australia. Cadell and others became notorious for their coercion, capture and sale of Aboriginal people as slaves. The slaves were often detained temporarily at camps known as &quot;barracoons&quot; on Barrow Island, offshore. In 1875 magistrate Robert Fairbairn was sent to investigate pearling conditions at Shark Bay, following reports that people, described as Malays, employed by Cadell and Charles Broadhurst were unpaid, unable to return home and some had starved to death. Fairbairn held that Cadell had not paid 10 Malays from the time they were engaged at Batavia in 1874 and he was required to pay the 10 Malays plus an additional 4 months wages as amends for the lack of food, totaling £198. 14s. 4d. They received just £16. 16s. from the sale of Cadell&#x27;s property at Shark Bay as Cadell had left the Colony of Western Australia some months previously. Broadhurst was also found to have underpaid 18 Malays totaling £183. 4s. 2d. however the judgement was set aside by the Supreme Court on the technicality that Broadhurst had not been given proper notice of the claim.

== Fiji ==
=== Before annexation (1865 to 1874)===
The blackbirding era began in Fiji on 5 July 1865 when Ben Pease received the first licence to transport 40 labourers from the New Hebrides to Fiji in order to work on cotton plantations. The American Civil War had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market and cultivation of this cash crop in Fiji was potentially an extremely profitable business. Thousands of Anglo-American and Anglo-Australian planters flocked to Fiji to establish plantations and the demand for cheap labour boomed. Transportation of Kanaka labour to Fiji continued up until 1911 when it became prohibited by law. A probable total of around 45,000 Islanders were taken to work in Fiji during this 46-year period with approximately a quarter of these dying while under their term of labour.
Albert Ross Hovell, son of the noted explorer William Hilton Hovell, was a prominent blackbirder in the early years of the Fijian labour market. In 1867 he was captain of &quot;Sea Witch&quot;, recruiting men and boys from Tanna and Lifou. The following year, Hovell was in command of &quot;Young Australian&quot; which was involved in an infamous voyage resulting in charges of murder and slavery being laid. After being recruited, at least three Islanders were shot dead aboard the vessel and the rest sold in Levuka for £1,200. Hovell and his supercargo, Hugo Levinger, were arrested in Sydney in 1869, found guilty by jury and sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment but both were discharged from prison only after a couple of years.

In 1868, the Acting British Consul in Fiji, John Bates Thurston, brought only minor regulations upon the trade through the introduction of a licensing system for the labour vessels. Melanesian labourers were generally recruited for a term of three years at a rate of three pounds per year and issued with basic clothing and rations. The payment was half of that offered in Queensland and like that colony was only given at the end of the three-year term usually in the form of poor quality goods rather than cash. Most Melanesians were recruited by combination of deceit and violence, and then locked up in the ship&#x27;s hold to prevent escape. They were sold in Fiji to the colonists at a rate of £3 to £6 per head for males and £10 to £20 for females. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the surviving labourers back to their villages, but many were disembarked at places distant from their homelands.

A notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the brig &quot;Carl&quot;, organised by Dr James Patrick Murray, to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of Fiji. Murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, so to appear to be church missionaries. When islanders were enticed to a religious service, Murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats. During the voyage Murray and his crew shot about 60 islanders. He was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members. The captain of &quot;Carl&quot;, Joseph Armstrong, along with the mate Charles Dowden were sentenced to death, which was later commuted to life imprisonment.

Some Islanders brought to Fiji against their will demonstrated desperate actions to escape from their situation. Some groups managed to overpower the crews of smaller vessels to take command of these ships and attempt to sail back to their home islands. For example, in late 1871, Islanders aboard &quot;Peri&quot; being transported to a plantation on a smaller Fijian island, freed themselves, killed most of the crew and took charge of the vessel. Unfortunately, the ship was low in supplies and was blown westward into the open ocean where they spent two months adrift. Eventually, &quot;Peri&quot; was spotted by Captain John Moresby aboard near to Hinchinbrook Island off the coast of Queensland. Only thirteen of the original eighty kidnapped Islanders were alive and able to be rescued.

Labour vessels involved in this period of blackbirding for the Fijian market also included &quot;Donald McLean&quot; under the command of captain McLeod, and &quot;Flirt&quot; under captain McKenzie who often took people from Erromango. Captain Martin of &quot;Wild Duck&quot; stole people from Espiritu Santo, while other ships such as &quot;Lapwing&quot;, &quot;Kate Grant&quot;, &quot;Harriet Armytage&quot; and &quot;Frolic&quot; also participated in the kidnapping trade. The famous blackbirder, Bully Hayes kidnapped Islanders for the Fiji market in his Sydney-registered schooner, &quot;Atlantic&quot;. Many captains engaged in violent means to obtain the labourers. The crews of &quot;Margaret Chessel&quot;, &quot;Maria Douglass&quot; and &quot;Marion Renny&quot; were involved in fatal conflict with various Islanders. Captain Finlay McLever of &quot;Nukulau&quot; was arrested and tried in court for kidnapping and assault but was discharged due to a legal technicality.

The passing of the Pacific Islanders Protection Act in 1872 by the British government was meant to improve the conditions for the Islanders but instead it legitimised the labour trade and the treatment of the blackbirded Islanders upon the Fiji plantations remained appalling. In his 1873 report, the British Consul to Fiji, Edward March, outlined how the labourers were treated as slaves. They were given insufficient food, subjected to regular beatings and sold on to other colonists. If they became rebellious they were either imprisoned by their owners or sentenced by magistrates (who were also plantation owners) to heavy labour. The planters were allowed to inflict punishment and restrain the Islanders as they saw fit and young girls were openly bartered for and sold into sexual slavery. Many workers were not paid and those who survived and were able to return to their home islands were regarded as lucky.

===After annexation (1875 to 1911)===
The British annexed Fiji in October 1874 and the labour trade in Pacific Islanders continued as before. In 1875, the year of the catastrophic measles epidemic, the chief medical officer in Fiji, Sir William MacGregor, listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1,000 Islander labourers. The Governor of Fiji, Sir Arthur Gordon, endorsed not only the procuring of Kanaka labour but became an active organiser in the plan to expand it to include mass importation of indentured coolie workers from India. The establishment of the Western Pacific High Commission in 1877, which was based in Fiji, further legitimised the trade by imposing British authority upon most people living in Melanesia.

Violence and kidnapping persisted with Captain Haddock of &quot;Marion Renny&quot; shooting people at Makira and burning their villages. Captain John Daly of &quot;Heather Belle&quot; was convicted of kidnapping and jailed but was soon allowed to leave Fiji and return to Sydney. Many deaths continued to occur upon the blackbirding vessels bound for Fiji, with perhaps the worst example from this period being that which occurred on &quot;Stanley&quot;. This vessel was chartered by the colonial British government in Fiji to conduct six recruiting voyages for the Fiji labour market. Captain James Lynch was in command and on one of these voyages he ordered 150 recruits to be locked in the ship&#x27;s hold during an extended period of stormy weather. By the time the ship arrived in Levuka, around fifty Islanders had died from suffocation and neglect. A further ten who were hospitalised were expected to die. Captain Lynch and the crew of &quot;Stanley&quot; faced no recriminations for this disaster and were soon at sea again recruiting for the government.

This conflict together with competition for Pacific Islander labour from Queensland made recruiting sufficient workers for the Fiji plantations difficult. Beginning in 1879 with the arrival of &quot;Leonidas&quot;, the transport of Indian indentured labourers to Fiji commenced. However, this coolie labour was more expensive and the market for blackbirded Islander workers remained strong for much of the 1880s. In 1882, the search for new sources of Islander labour expanded firstly to the Line Islands and then to New Britain and New Ireland. The very high death rate of Line Islanders taken for the Fiji market quickly forced the prohibition of taking people from there. Although the death rates of recruits from New Britain and New Ireland were also high, the trade in humans from these islands was allowed to continue. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company made major investments in the Fijian sugar industry around this time with much of the labour being provided by workers from New Britain. Many of the recruits taken from this island on the labour vessel &quot;Lord of Isles&quot; were put to work on the CSR sugar mill at Nausori. The Fijian labour report for the years 1878 to 1882 revealed that 18 vessels were engaged in the trade, recruiting 7,137 Islanders with 1270 or nearly 20% of these dying while in Fiji. Fijian registered ships involved in the trade at this stage included &quot;Winifred&quot;, &quot;Meg Merrilies&quot;, &quot;Dauntless&quot; and &quot;Ovalau&quot;.

By 1890, the number of Melanesian labourers declined in preference to imported Indian indentured workers, but they were still being recruited and employed in such places as sugar mills and ports. In 1901, Islanders continued to be sold in Fiji for £15 per head and it was only in 1902 that a system of paying monthly cash wages directly to the workers was proposed. When Islander labourers were expelled from Queensland in 1906, around 350 were transferred to the plantations in Fiji. After the system of recruitment ended in 1911, those who remained in Fiji settled in areas like the region around Suva. Their multi-cultural descendants identify as a distinct community but, to outsiders, their language and culture cannot be distinguished from native Fijians. Descendants of Solomon Islanders have filed land claims to assert their right to traditional settlements in Fiji. A group living at Tamavua-i-Wai in Fiji received a High Court verdict in their favour on 1 February 2007. The court refused a claim by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to force the islanders to vacate the land on which they had been living for seventy years.

== French Polynesia ==
In 1863, British capitalist William Stewart set up the Tahiti Cotton and Coffee Plantation Company at Atimaono on the south-west coast of Tahiti. Initially Stewart used imported Chinese coolie labour but soon shifted to blackbirded Polynesian labour to work the plantation. Bully Hayes, an American ship-captain who achieved notoriety for his activities in the Pacific from the 1850s to the 1870s, arrived in Papeete, Tahiti in December 1868 on his ship &quot;Rona&quot; with 150 men from Niue. Hayes offered them for sale as indentured labourers. The French Governor of Tahiti, who was invested in the company, used government ships such as &quot;Lucene&quot; to recruit South Sea Islanders for Stewart. These people were unloaded in a &quot;half-naked and wholly starved&quot; condition and on arrival at the plantation they were treated as slaves. Captain Blackett of the vessel &quot;Moaroa&quot;, was also chartered by Stewart to acquire labourers. In 1869, Blackett bought 150 Gilbert Islanders from another blackbirding ship for £5 per head. On transferring them to &quot;Moaroa&quot;, the islanders, including another 150 already imprisoned on the vessel, rebelled killing Blackett and some of the crew. The remaining crew managed to isolate the islanders to a part of the ship and then used explosives to blow them up. Close to 200 people were killed in this incident with &quot;Moaroa&quot; still able to offload about 60 surviving labourers at Tahiti.

Conditions at the Atimaono plantation were appalling with long hours, heavy labour, poor food and inadequate shelter being provided. Harsh punishment was meted out to those who did not work and sickness was prevalent. The mortality rate for one group of blackbirded labourers at Atimaono was around 80%. William Stewart died in 1873 and the Tahiti Cotton and Coffee Plantation Company went bankrupt a year later.

Another notorious blackbirder was a fellow countryman of Bully Hayes, who was also given the nickname &quot;Bully&quot;. Captain &quot;Bully&quot; Proctor procured workers for the New Caledonian nickel mines, and who was well known in the 1870s to 1890s, in Noumea, and Samoa. He was master of the &quot;Ika Vula&quot; and the &quot;Ernestine&quot;. He was also known as &quot;Captain One Leg&quot;, and would put fear into people by firing his pistol into his wooden leg. He boasted of murdering 15 people, and was notorious for shooting the husband of New Hebridean woman who Proctor was sexually abusing. After an incident on Futuna in 1876 when he assaulted 2 missionaries, he was subdued and removed from the island.

== Hawaiian Islands ==
The sugar industry in the Hawaiian Islands was expanding rapidly during the early 1870s and despite over 50% of all male able-bodied Native Hawaiians being utilised as workers on these plantations, there were an insufficient number to keep up with production. From 1868 to 1872, around 200 people from places such as Tahiti, the Caroline Islands, and the Line Islands were recruited to work on the Hawaiian plantations owned by European colonists. Most of these people died and the operation was considered a failure. However, in 1877 British officials in Hawaii planned a more organised system of Pacific Islander recruitment. Captain H.W. Mist of the Royal Navy was employed to arrange a large shipment of Islanders to be recruited for Hawaii. Mist bought the vessel &quot;Stormbird&quot; in Sydney and appointed another ex-navy officer, Captain George Jackson, to conduct the expedition. On this first voyage, &quot;Stormbird&quot; recruited 85 people from Rotuma, Nonouti, Maiana and Tabiteuea. Jackson called in at Pohnpei on the way to Hawaii where he chained up a local headman and shot another trying to attempt a rescue. During the voyage, Jackson had attempted to kidnap at gunpoint a number of young women from Maiana but was interrupted by the presence of another ship.

&quot;Stormbird&quot; made around another five recruiting voyages involving further violence and kidnapping, mostly sailing to the Gilbert Islands. On one occasion, the government agent aboard the vessel, Henry Freeman, bought a boatload of Gilbert Islanders from another blackbirding vessel named the &quot;Sea Waif&quot;. By 1880 the labour trade to Hawaii expanded to the New Hebrides. Captain Cadigan of &quot;Pomare&quot; took people from these islands via night raids, armed attacks and firing cannon at canoes. The death rates of the recruits on board &quot;Pomare&quot; as they were transported to Hawaii were as high as 20%. Captain Tierney of the labour vessel &quot;Hazard&quot; was paid by the Planters&#x27; Labour and Supply Company of Hawaii $15 per recruit and consequently used much deception in obtaining a profitable quota of human cargo. Other ships involved were &quot;Kaluna&quot;, &quot;Elsinore&quot;, &quot;Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Nickolaus&quot;, &quot;Mana&quot; and &quot;Allie Rowe&quot;. &quot;Allie Rowe&quot; undertook the last recruiting voyage to the Pacific Islands for the Hawaiian plantations in 1887. This vessel, commanded by Captain Phillips, proceeded illegally without a license and Phillips was also later charged and convicted of kidnap in relation to this final voyage.

From 1868 until the year 1887 when the recruiting of Pacific Islanders to Hawaii was largely replaced with the more cost effective Japanese immigration scheme, some 2,600 Islanders were recruited. From 1880 to 1883 these people were protected by strong government measures which included an appointed Protector of Pacific Islanders, routine checks of worker conditions and the ability of the labourers to take employers to court for maltreatment. These workers, usually on 3 year contracts, were also paid cash wages at the end of each month which amounted from £10 to £16 per annum. In spite of these conditions during these years, the mortality rate of the workers was still over 10% for each year. Outside of these years, where protections were less, the death rate was much higher.

When recruiting ended in 1887, 650 Pacific Islander workers remained or were left abandoned in Hawaii and by 1895 this number had reduced to less than 400. In 1904, 220 mostly Gilbert Islanders continued to live in poverty at Honolulu and at Maui. These people were gathered together and repatriated in that same year to the Gilbert Islands where they faced further destitution in a land they had been absent from for twenty years.

== New Caledonia ==

Blackbirding and recruitment of South Sea Islanders as labourers to the French colony of New Caledonia began in 1865 and lasted until the 1930s. Around 15,000 people were transported during this period, the vast majority coming from the New Hebrides. In 1865, the French colonial government contracted sandalwood merchant Andrew Henry to bring 33 people from Erromango. Henry had previously been involved in sending labourers to Queensland for the cotton plantations of Robert Towns. Another recruiter, John Higginson, entered the trade in 1868, and by 1870, around 720 Islanders had been brought to labour in New Caledonia. A mining boom in 1873 saw a large increase in labour demand and many more ships became involved in the blackbirding trade with 900 Islanders being recruited in 1874 alone. Apart from some early government controls in the 1860s, the recruitment of Islanders was highly unregulated and open to abuse. Children as young as six years old could be legally recruited on lengthy contracts of up to twelve years. These children could also be legally paid at only half the rate of adults and given only half the required rations. Somewhere between a quarter and half of all the Islanders transported and forced to labour at New Caledonia were children.

The blackbirded labourers in New Caledonia worked in the plantation, mining, pastoral, domestic servant and sailing industries. Approximately 33% of these workers died while in New Caledonia and around half of those who survived did not receive any payment for their toil. They were often not returned to their islands of origin and of those who were, about a third died in the first year of returning from poor health acquired from working in terrible conditions at New Caledonia. The labourers were subjected to inadequate food, poor shelter and harsh punishments whilst in New Caledonia. They could be imprisoned for not working to their employer&#x27;s satisfaction, where the colonial government exploited them further as unpaid prison labour. They were also sold-on and transferred to other colonists upon the death or bankruptcy of their original employer. Well-known blackbirding vessels involved in the labour trade to New Caledonia were &quot;Aoba&quot;, &quot;Annette&quot;, &quot;Venus&quot;, &quot;Aurora&quot;, &quot;Ika Vuka&quot;, &quot;Idaho&quot;, &quot;Ambroua&quot; and &quot;Effie Meikle&quot;. Captains and recruiters notorious for kidnap and blackbirding for the New Caledonia market included James Toutant Proctor, &quot;Black Tom&quot;, Jean-Louis Villedieu, Martial Briault, Charles Peterson Stuart, Walter Champion, Gabriel Madezo and Captain H. McKenzie. The company Joubert &amp; Carter run by Didier Numa Joubert and Douglas Carter owned many of the blackbirding vessels in the early years of trade. Recruiting to New Caledonia continued well into the 20th Century but at a much lower rate and less violent manner. It was only brought to an end in the 1930s with the approach of World War II.

== Mexico and Guatemala ==
In the late 1880s, a worldwide boom in coffee demand fuelled the expansion of coffee growing in many regions including the south-west of Mexico and in neighbouring Guatemala. This expansion resulted in local labour shortages for the European plantation owners and managers in these areas. William Forsyth, an Englishman with expert knowledge on tropical plantations, promoted a scheme of recruiting people from the Gilbert Islands to counteract the shortage of workers in Mexico and Guatemala. In 1890, Captain Luttrell of the vessel &quot;Helen W. Almy&quot; was chartered and sent out to the Pacific where he recruited 300 Gilbert Islanders. They were offloaded in Mexico and sent to work at a coffee plantation near Tapachula owned by an American named John Magee. By 1894, despite supposedly having a three-year contract, none had been returned home and only 58 were still living.

In 1891, the barque &quot;Tahiti&quot; under command of Captain Ferguson was assigned to bring another load of Gilbert Islanders to Tapachula. This ship acquired around 370 islanders including about 100 children. While bringing its human cargo to the Americas, &quot;Tahiti&quot; suffered storm damage and was forced to anchor in Drakes Bay north of San Francisco. Amid accusations of slavery and blackbirding, Ferguson transferred command of the ship to another officer and abandoned the islanders in what amounted to a floating prison. Repairs were delayed for months and in early 1892, &quot;Tahiti&quot; was found capsized with all but a few survivors drowned.

Despite this tragedy another ship, &quot;Montserrat&quot;, was fitted out to contract more Gilbert Islanders, this time for coffee plantations in Guatemala. Ferguson was again employed, but this time as recruiter not as captain. A journalist aboard &quot;Montserrat&quot; described the recruiting of islanders as clear slavery and even though Royal Navy officers had boarded the vessel for inspection, an understanding existed whereby the authorities intentionally refused to detain the crew of &quot;Montserrat&quot;. &quot;Montserrat&quot; sailed to Guatemala with around 470 islanders and once disembarked they were sold for $100 each and force marched 70 miles to the plantations in the highlands. Overwork and disease killed around 200 of them.

Approximately 1,200 Gilbert Islanders were recruited in three shiploads for the Mexican and Guatemalan coffee plantations. Only 250 survived, most of these being returned to their homeland in two voyages in 1896 and 1908. This represented a mortality rate of 80%.

== Peru ==
For several months between 1862 and 1863, crews on Peruvian ships combed the islands of Polynesia, from Easter Island in the eastern Pacific to the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati) in the west, seeking workers to fill an extreme labour shortage in Peru. Joseph Charles Byrne, an Irish speculator, received financial backing to import South Sea Islanders as indentured workers. Byrne&#x27;s ship, &quot;Adelante&quot;, set forth across the Pacific and at Tongareva in the Northern Cook Islands he was able to acquire 253 recruits of which more than half were women and children. &quot;Adelante&quot; returned to the Peruvian port of Callao where the human cargo were sold off and sent to work as plantation labourers and domestic servants. A considerable profit was made by the scheme&#x27;s financiers and almost immediately other speculators and ship owners set out to make money on Polynesian labour.

=== Easter Island mass-kidnapping ===
At the end of 1862, eight Peruvian ships organised under Captain Marutani of &quot;Rosa y Carmen&quot; conducted an armed operation at Easter Island where, over several days, the combined crews systematically surrounded villages and captured as many of the Islanders as possible. In these raids and others like them that occurred at Easter Island during this period, 1407 people were taken for the Peruvian labour trade. This represented a third of the island&#x27;s population. In the following months, &quot;Rosa y Carmen&quot; together with about 30 other vessels involved in recruiting for Peru, kidnapped or deceptively obtained people throughout Polynesia. Captain Marutani&#x27;s vessel alone took people from Niue, Samoa and Tokelau, as well as those that he kidnapped from Easter Island.

=== &#x27;Ata mass-kidnapping ===

In June 1863, about 350 people were living on &#x27;Ata, an atoll in Tonga. Captain Thomas James McGrath of the Tasmanian whaler &quot;Grecian&quot;, having decided that the new slave trade was more profitable than whaling, went to the atoll and invited the islanders on board for trading. However, once almost half of the population was on board, he ordered the ship&#x27;s compartments locked, and the ship departed. These 144 people never returned to their homes. &quot;Grecian&quot; met with a Peruvian slave vessel, &quot;General Prim&quot;, and the islanders were transferred to this ship which transported them to Callao. Due to new government regulations in Peru against the blackbirding trade, the islanders were not allowed to disembark and remained aboard for many weeks while their repatriation was organised. Finally on 2 October 1863, by which time many of the imprisoned &#x27;Ata people had died or were dying from neglect and disease, a vessel was organised to take them back. However, this ship dumped the Tongans on uninhabited Cocos Island. A month later the Peruvian warship &quot;Tumbes&quot; went to rescue the remaining 38 survivors and took them to the Peruvian port of Paita, where they probably died.

=== Deception at Tuvalu ===
The Rev. A. W. Murray, the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu, described the practices of blackbirders in the Ellice Islands. He said they promised islanders that they would be taught about God while working in coconut oil production, but the slavers&#x27; intended destination was the Chincha Islands in Peru. Rev. Murray reported that in 1863, about 180 people were taken from Funafuti and about 200 were taken from Nukulaelae, leaving fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae. On Funafuti and Nukulaelae, the resident traders facilitated the recruiting of the islanders by the &quot;blackbirders&quot;.

=== Extreme death rate ===
The Peruvian labour trade in Polynesians was short-lived, only lasting from 1862 to 1863. In this period an estimated 3,634 Polynesians were recruited. Over 2,000 died from disease, starvation or neglect either aboard the blackbirding ships or at the places of labour they were sent to. The Peruvian government shut down the operation in 1863 and ordered the repatriation of those who survived. A smallpox and dysentery outbreak in Peru accompanied this operation resulting in the death of a further 1,030 Polynesian labourers. Some of the islanders survived long enough to bring these contagious diseases to their home islands causing local epidemics and additional mortality. By 1866, only around 250 of those recruited had survived with about 100 of these remaining in Peru. The death rate was therefore 93%.

== Samoa ==
In the late 1850s, German merchant Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy, established a trading company based at Apia on the island of Upolu in Samoa. His company, J.C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn, was able to obtain large tracts of land from the indigenous population at times of civil unrest by selling firearms and exacerbating factional conflict. By 1872, the company owned over 100,000 acres on Upolu and greatly expanded their cotton and other agricultural plantations on the island. Cheap labour was required to work these plantations and the blackbirding operations of the Germans expanded at this time. After initially utilising people from Niue, the company sent labour vessels to the Gilbert Islands and the Nomoi Islands, exploiting food shortages there to recruit numerous people for their plantations in Samoa. Men, women and children of all ages were taken, separated and sent to work in harsh conditions with many succumbing to illness and poor diet.

In 1880, the company became known as Deutsche Handels und Plantagen Gesellschaft (DHPG) and had further expanded their Samoan plantations. Labour recruitment at this stage turned to New Britain, New Ireland and the Solomon Islands. The German blackbirding vessel, &quot;Upolu&quot;, became well known in the area and was involved in several conflicts with islanders while recruiting. Imported Chinese workers eventually became more favourable but labour recruiting from Melanesian islands continued until at least the transfer of power from the Germans to New Zealand at the start of World War I.

Large British and American plantations which owned blackbirding vessels or exploited blackbirded labour also existed in colonial Samoa. The W &amp; A McArthur Company representing Anglo-Australian interests was one of these and recruiting vessels such as &quot;Ubea&quot;, &quot;Florida&quot; and &quot;Maria&quot; were based in Samoa. In 1880, the crew of the British blackbirding ship, &quot;Mary Anderson&quot;, was involved in shooting recruits on board, while in 1894 &quot;Aele&quot; was involved in recruiting starving Gilbert Islanders.

== United States ==

=== Reverse underground railroad blackbirding ===
Since colonial times in the United States, the Reverse Underground Railroad existed to capture free African-Americans and fugitive slaves and sell them into slavery, being particularly prevalent in the 19th century after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed. New York City and Philadelphia were particularly prominent places for these kidnappers to work, causing fear of being kidnapped by anyone to become prevalent.

==Representation in popular culture==
American author Jack London recounted in his memoir, &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot; (1907), an incident at Langa Langa Lagoon Malaita, Solomon Islands, when the local islanders attacked a &quot;recruiting&quot; ship:
In another passage from the same book, he wrote:
&quot;Georges Baudoux&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Jean M&#x27;Baraï the Trepang Fisherman&quot;, a semi-fictional novella, relates the brutal history of the Kanaka trade and highlights 19th century imperial connections between the French and British Pacific. Translated from the original French by Karin Speedy in 2015, it offers a French/New Caledonian perspective on blackbirding in the Pacific, first published in 1919.

Artist Jasmine Togo-Brisby makes art about blackbirding. She is a fourth-generation descendant of slaves who were kidnapped from Vanuatu in 1863. She is currently based in New Zealand, her exhibitions include &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; at Te Uru in 2016, and &quot;Birds of Passage&quot; at the Dunedin School of Art gallery in 2019.

<text>The African palm swift (Cypsiurus parvus) is a small swift. It is very similar to the Asian palm swift, &quot;Cypsiurus balasiensis&quot;, and was formerly considered to be the same species. The Malagasy palm swift was also recently split from this species. This is a common species with a very wide distribution which faces no obvious threats and may be increasing in numbers as a result of the cultivation of the exotic Washington palm, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Description==
This 16 cm long species is mainly pale brown in colour. It has long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. The body is slender, and the tail is long and deeply forked, although it is usually held closed. The call is a loud, shrill scream. Sexes are similar, and young birds differ mainly in their shorter tails. Palm swifts have very short legs which they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces, since swifts never settle voluntarily on the ground.

==Distribution==
The African palm swift is native to Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mayotte, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

==Ecology==

These swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. Palm swifts often feed near the ground. They drink on the wing. It is a common resident breeder in tropical Africa. The down and feather nest is glued to the underside of a palm frond with saliva, which is also used to secure the usually two eggs. This is a fast-flying bird of open country, which is strongly associated with oil palms but is also found in wooded savannah, thornbush and cultivated land.

<doc id="575237" wikidata="Q1126248" url="?curid=575237" title="Generation of '98">
<text>The Generation of &#x27;98 (), also called Generation of 1898 (), was a group of novelists, poets, essayists, and philosophers active in Spain at the time of the Spanish–American War (1898), committed to cultural and aesthetic renewal, and associated with modernismo.

The name was coined by José Martínez Ruiz (commonly known as &quot;Azorín&quot;) in his 1913 essays titled &quot;La generación de 1898&quot;, alluding to the moral, political, and social crisis in Spain produced by the loss of the colonies of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam after defeat in the Spanish–American War that same year. Historian Raymond Carr defines the Generation of &#x27;98 as the &quot;group of creative writers who were born in the seventies, whose major works fall in the two decades after 1898&quot;.

The intellectuals included in this group are known for their criticism of the Spanish literary and educational establishments, which they saw as having characteristics of conformism, ignorance, and a lack of any true spirit. Their criticism was coupled with and heavily connected to the group&#x27;s dislike for the Restoration movement that was occurring in Spanish government.

==Historical context==
The group that has become known as The Generation of &#x27;98 was affected by several major events and trends in Spanish history. According to Carr&#x27;s definition of the group, most of them were born in the 1870s. These men were especially informed by Spain&#x27;s defeat and humiliation in the Spanish–American War in 1898, which crystallized into two distinct political movements, Republicanism and Carlist Monarchism, marked by the oscillation of power (a zeal for reform characterized these years of Spanish history):

# &quot;The Glorious Revolution&quot; in 1868 and the following six years of revolution, in which the country overthrew Queen Isabella and the monarchy and then had to try to fill the political void with a stable government.
# The First Spanish Republic of 1873 lasted only 22 months.
# The Restoration project of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, was an attempt to create a constitutional monarchy based on Victorian Britain, which began shortly after Cánovas was appointed prime minister by Alfonso XII in 1874. A system called &quot;turno pacífico&quot; (&quot;peaceful alternation&quot;) was devised in which two political parties alternated control of the government, by means of a heavily orchestrated and controlled electoral process. The Restoration was reasonably successful in restoring political stability, but finally ended with the Second Spanish Republic in 1931.

===The restoration project===
The first intellectual criticism took place at the dawn of the Restoration movement. In 1875, the minister for development, Manuel Orovio (1817–1883), sought to reinforce traditional &quot;Spanish values&quot; such as the dogma of contemporary Spanish Catholicism by an edict known as the &quot;Decreto Orovio&quot;.

===Academic repression===
This &quot;crackdown&quot; was a response to various attempts, notably but not exclusively by the intellectual elite listed below, to introduce some form of liberal democracy both in Spanish academic life and in the wider society.

Several progressive professors were dismissed from the Central University of Madrid for promoting the ideas of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781–1832), a German philosopher who advocated Krausism.

===La Institución Libre de Enseñanza===
In 1876, these dismissed professors, led by Francisco Giner de los Ríos, founded the Institución Libre de Enseñanza (ILE), or &quot;The Free Educational Institution&quot;, a secular private educational institution that started with university-level instruction and later extended its activities to primary and secondary education.

Their work constituted an indirect repudiation of the official instruction of the time, which they had found ineffective, insufficient, and subject to suffocating control by political and religious interests. The Institution departed from this norm by stressing the importance of intellectual freedom and moral self-improvement.

==A movement of criticism and ideals==
The Generation of &#x27;98 intellectuals objected to the meticulously organized structure of the Restoration system of government and the corruption that it fostered. After Spain&#x27;s bloody and decisive defeat in the Spanish–American War, which resulted in thousands of dead Spaniards and the loss of all of Spain&#x27;s remaining colonies in the Americas and the Pacific, these writers were prompted to voice their criticism. They agreed on the urgency of finding a means, in areas of thought and activity separate from politics, of rescuing Spain from its catatonic state. 

The writers, poets and playwrights of this generation maintained a strong intellectual unity, opposed the Restoration of the monarchy in Spain, revived Spanish literary myths, and broke with classical schemes of literary genres. They brought back traditional and lost words and always alluded to the old kingdom of Castile, with many supporting the idea of Spanish Regionalism. 

Often, literature produced by these writers conveyed themes of nostalgia for the past glory of Spain, especially its traditions and landscape. Conversely, they also present criticisms of the sociopolitical situation during that era, drawing conclusions about factors that caused the decline of Spain. As such, common characteristics of these works involved a minimalistic writing style, employing third person narration and a heavy dependence on dialogue instead of descriptions to advance the narrative. Many writers also experimented with new forms of genres, as Miguel de Unamuno did in conceptualizing the nivola.

Most texts in this literary era were produced in the years immediately after 1910 and are generally marked by the justification of radicalism and rebellion. Examples of this are the last poems incorporated to &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot;, of Antonio Machado; Miguel de Unamuno&#x27;s articles written during the First World War or in the essayistic texts of Pío Baroja.

The criticism of the &quot;Generation of &#x27;98&quot; today from modern intellectuals is that the group was characterized by an increase of egoism, and by a great feeling of frustration with Spanish society and politics.

==Key figures==
Some of the key intellectual minds of the Generation of &#x27;98 include:
* Joaquín Costa
* Ángel Ganivet
* Miguel de Unamuno
* Ramón del Valle-Inclán
* José Martínez Ruiz (Azorín)
* Pío Baroja
* Antonio Machado
* Manuel Machado
* Ramiro de Maeztu
* Consuelo Álvarez Pool

<doc id="575239" wikidata="Q550550" url="?curid=575239" title="Pulse (Pink Floyd album)">
<text>Pulse is the third live album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 29 May 1995 by EMI in the United Kingdom and on 6 June 1995 by Columbia in the United States. It was recorded during the European leg of Pink Floyd&#x27;s Division Bell Tour in 1994.

==Content and recording==
&quot;Pulse&quot; includes a performance of the entirety of Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. It also features &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, a Syd Barrett song not performed since the early 1970s. &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part II&quot; features small portions of the songs &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part I&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part III&quot;.

Unlike the previous Pink Floyd live album, &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot;, no parts were rerecorded in the studio. However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg. The album was mixed in QSound, which produces a 3D audio effect even on a two channel stereo system.

==Packaging==

Early CD versions came with a flashing red LED on the side of the case. This was designed by the EMI contractor Jon Kempner, who was awarded the platinum disc, using the now discontinued LM3909 LED flasher IC. The circuit was powered by a single AA battery; the battery life was stated to be over six months. Some versions were also made with two AA batteries and later editions of the CD set did not feature the blinking LED.

==Release==
In the United States, despite a price of $34.99 () (which included flashing spine light and two AA batteries) &quot;Pulse&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during the week of 24 June 1995 with 198,000 copies sold, it became the first multidisc album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since the chart started using SoundScan data in May 1991. The next week it fell off to number three on the chart. It remained on the chart for twenty two weeks. It was certified two times platinum by the RIAA on 31 July 1995 for shipments of one million units.

On 1 July 1995 the video version of &quot;Pulse&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Music Videos chart with 16,500 units sold. The video was certified eight times platinum by the RIAA on 31 July 2006 for shipments of 800,000 units.

The video version (on VHS and Laserdisc) also featured the song &quot;Take It Back&quot;, and an almost complete performance from their 20 October show at Earl&#x27;s Court, London. The &quot;Pulse&quot; DVD was released on 10 July 2006. On 16 December 2021, the band announced on social media platforms that a re-release of &quot;Pulse&quot; on DVD and a first-time release on Blu-ray format was on 18 February 2022. The packaging will re-introduce the blinking LED featured with the original CD release from 1995.

The vinyl version was released as a four-LP box set and included &quot;One of These Days&quot; (also heard on the cassette release) as well as a large version of the photo booklet. The debut of the album was highlighted by a light show from the top of the Empire State Building in New York City with music simulcasted on a New York City radio station.

== Reception ==

Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Paul Moody wrote that &quot;Pulse&quot; comprised &quot;a rehash of the usual prog meanderings ... Every perfectly recorded note and every immaculately reproduced photo tells you that this is music for the sort of hand-wringing hippies who still like to think they&#x27;re in tune with the cosmos even though there&#x27;s a BMW in the drive.&quot; He was critical of the LED on the packaging, saying it &quot;represents the multi-million pound rehabilitation of Pink Floyd by a generation who progged out in the 70s, sold out in the 80s and started gloating about it in the 90s in the gauchest possible terms&quot;. 

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rob O&#x27;Connor argued that the &quot;studio perfection&quot; of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; did not translate well to live performance, and criticised the &quot;loud, annoying&quot; audience.

<text>The Asian palm swift (Cypsiurus balasiensis) is a small swift. It is very similar to the African palm swift, &quot;Cypsiurus parvus&quot;, and was formerly considered to be the same species.

It is a common resident breeder in tropical Asia from India to the Philippines. The down and feather nest is glued to the underside of a palm leaf with saliva, which is also used to secure the usually two or three eggs. This is a bird of open country and cultivation, which is strongly associated with oil palms.

This 13 cm long species is mainly pale brown in colour. It has long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. The body is slender, and the tail is long and deeply forked, although it is usually held closed. The call is a loud shrill scream.

Sexes are similar, and young birds differ from adults mainly in their shorter tails. Asian palm swift has very short legs which it uses only for clinging to vertical surfaces, since swifts never settle voluntarily on the ground.

These swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. Asian palm swifts often feed near the ground, and they drink on the wing.

<text>Algiers () is a historic neighborhood of New Orleans and is the only Orleans Parish community located on the West Bank of the Mississippi River. Algiers is known as the 15th Ward, one of the 17 Wards of New Orleans. It was once home to many jazz musicians

== History ==
===Early settlement ===
Algiers was established in 1719 as a plantation, not a neighborhood. It was first used as the location for the city&#x27;s powder magazine, a holding area for the newly arrived enslaved Africans. Decades later, it became a port call for the displaced Cajuns. This region of the city was a French colonial encampment originally managed by Le Page du Pratz on which cabins housed the enslaved. According to geographer Richard Campanella, Ph.D., this area was used as a &quot;warehouse, workshop, lumber mill and a farm in service of the principal colony across the river. Its primary use, however, was as a depository for captive Africans recently arrived from Senegambia as well as the Bight of Benin and Congo regions. Before then it was Known as the Company Plantation, the site in the 1720s had more than 30 cabins used for the temporary sheltering of slaves until they were sold to colonists, or for their permanent housing if they were owned by the Company itself — as were 154 people at one point, making present-day Algiers Point.&quot;

Developed as a town by Barthelemy Duverjé, Algiers expanded due mainly to the shipbuilding and repair industries of the dry docks and the extensive railroad yards. A large part of the town surrounding the Courthouse was destroyed by fire in 1895 but rose again like a Phoenix from the ashes.

In 1870, Algiers was annexed to the city as the 15th Ward, an arrangement which has remained despite repeated discussions of secession. Until the latter 1930s, rail yards housed large amounts of freight and rolling stock, which was brought back and forth across the Mississippi River by barge. Then, the Huey P. Long Bridge, which included a railway bridge, was built upriver at Bridge City, Louisiana. The largest railroad presence had been the Southern Pacific yard. That location is still known to Algerines as &quot;the SP yard.&quot; For decades, it was largely a vacant strip. Portions of the tract were redeveloped for housing in the early 21st century. In the yard&#x27;s active days, a steam-powered Southern Pacific train ferry brought railroad cars from there across the Mississippi River.

=== 20th century ===
In 1901, the U.S. Navy established a naval station in Algiers. During the early 20th century, Algiers was segregated due to the Jim Crow Laws of the Southern United States. Under Jim Crow, blacks were not allowed to live in Algiers Point, which was tended for whites or Creoles of color who passed as white. Blacks occupied the area downriver from Algiers Point called McDonoghville (locals refer to it as &quot;Over the Hump&quot;). The neighborhood was named after John McDonogh. Before his death in 1850, McDonogh established &quot;Freetown&quot; for formerly enslaved people and other people of color. Freetown was renamed McDonoghville in 1815. When Algiers became a part of Orleans Parrish in 1870, it became the largest populated black community on the West bank of the Mississippi River. Many Jazz artists such as Kid Thomas Valentine, Red Allen, and Papa Celestin all grew up in McDonoghville section in Algiers during the 1910s. 
Some of the early black neighborhoods included Riverview, Tunisbourg McCLendonville, LeBeoufville, Hendeeville, Oakdale, and Whitney. In 1938, L.B. Landry High School opened as the first all-black school in Algiers. The school was named after Dr. Lord Beaconsfield Landry, who lived in the area and died in 1934. It was also one of the first schools in New Orleans to serve African Americans. 

Around the 1930s and early 1940s, several other schools and neighborhoods were built for blacks, including Peter S. Lawton School and Oakdale. Oakdale once stood on the edge of Jefferson Parish and stretched from Whitney Avenue to the Mississippi River. It was destroyed in the late 1950s to make room for the Greater New Orleans Bridge.

Newton Street became the heart of Algiers&#x27;s black community as it was once filled with ballrooms, saloons, and Juke joints. Popular hangout spots like Kohlman&#x27;s Tavern, Ping Pong Club, and Whitney&#x27;s Ballroom attracted hundreds of people every weekend. The most famous, Greystone Voter&#x27;s League, became the place for Rhythm &amp; Blues shows and great singers such as Ray Charles, Son House, and B. B. King, who all played there. Most of the jazz venues in Algiers closed by the 1970s.

Algiers slowly declined after suburban neighborhoods were developed and expanded along Gen. Meyer and Gen. De Gaulle. Many white families from the older parts of the city began moving into the newly built sections of Algiers. Behrman Heights, initially built to house military families regardless of race, became the first racially integrated community. Aurora and Walnut Bend subdivisions remained mostly white middle-class. The oil industry provided many jobs and sustained the growth of commerce. In 1970, New Orleans Public Schools opened Olver Perry Walker Senior High School. O. Perry Walker was named after former New Orleans Public Schools superintendent Oliver Perry Walker, who supported segregation. Before the school opened its doors, many of the white students attended Martin Behrman High School until it was converted into a middle school in 1969. During the early 1970s, Whites had begun to move out of Behrman Heights after the Housing Authority of New Orleans opened the Christopher Park Homes for low-income black families. The building of a public housing site led to White flight. The White flight resulted in a major decline as many businesses left Algiers for more sustainable neighborhoods in the neighboring Jefferson Parish.

== Culture ==
Algiers was home to various jazz pioneers such as Red Allen, Peter Bocage, George Lewis, Papa Celestin, Kid Thomas Valentine and many others. Jazz musicians of the 1920s referred to Algiers as the &quot;Brooklyn of the South&quot;, the latter for its proximity to New Orleans as compared to New York and Brooklyn, both separated by a river. Algiers also has a long history of Brass band&#x27;s. The most notable is the Algiers Brass Band, one of the oldest traditional brass bands still active in the city. There were several social halls, including Algiers Masonic Hall, the Elks Hall, and the Ladies of Hope Benevolent Hall, where early jazz was played. There is some jazz parading in the neighborhood today.

== Crime ==
Algiers lies within NOPD&#x27;s 4th District jurisdiction of Orleans Parish. The 4th District violent crime rate in low-income neighborhoods besides Algiers Point, has been high since the late 1980s. These areas include the notorious Fischer Projects, Whitney, and Behrman Heights neighborhoods.

Between 1987 and 1988, 4th District&#x27;s violent crime rate doubled with the biggest increase in gun homicides. Algiers made national headlines during 1981 with the &quot;Algiers 7&quot; case in which seven officers were indicted for killing and torturing black families in revenge for the slaying of NOPD officer Gregory Newport in 1980.
Throughout the 1990s, homicides were the only violent crime that remained high in the district, reaching 29 in 1995 which was a slight decrease from 1991 rate.

In 2015, the district tallied 25 homicides, 26 in 2020. In 2022, the district was second in homicides behind Eastern New Orleans, with 38 homicides.

In 2017, 4th district teamed with the NOPD&#x27;s street-gang unit to quell gun battles spurred by conflicts between neighborhood groups. The groups were formed of loose associations among people, not stable enough to be considered traditional gangs, and had &quot;some very petty, petty beefs that led to very violent encounters,&quot; he said. To reduce crime, law enforcement installed 13 crime surveillance cameras, including ten fixed cameras and three mobile cameras, along with five license-plate readers, including three fixed readers and two mobile readers.

<doc id="575245" wikidata="Q2918178" url="?curid=575245" title="United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit">
<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (in case citations, D.C. Cir.) is one of the thirteen United States Courts of Appeals. It has the smallest geographical jurisdiction of any of the U.S. courts of appeals, and it covers only the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. It meets at the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, DC.

The D.C. Circuit is often considered to be second only to the U.S. Supreme Court in status and prestige, and it is sometimes unofficially termed &quot;the second highest court in the land&quot;. Because its jurisdiction covers the District of Columbia, it tends to be the main federal appellate court for issues of U.S. administrative law and constitutional law. Four of the nine current Supreme Court justices were previously judges on the D.C. Circuit: Chief Justice John Roberts and associate justices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Past justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, Warren E. Burger, Fred M. Vinson, and Wiley Blount Rutledge also served on the D.C. Circuit before their appointments to the Supreme Court. 

Because the D.C. Circuit does not represent any state, confirmation of nominees can be procedurally and practically easier than for nominees to the Courts of Appeals for the other geographical districts, as home-state senators have historically been able to hold up confirmation through the blue slip process.

== Current composition of the court ==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;






&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==List of former judges==



















== Chiefs ==









When Congress established this court in 1893 as the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, it had a chief justice, and the other judges were called associate justices, which was similar to the structure of the Supreme Court. The chief justiceship was a separate seat: the president would appoint the chief justice, and that person would stay chief justice until he left the court.

On June 25, 1948, 62 &quot;Stat.&quot; 869 and 62 &quot;Stat.&quot; 985 became law. These acts made the chief justice a chief judge. In 1954, another law, 68 &quot;Stat.&quot; 1245, clarified what was implicit in those laws: that the chief judgeship was not a mere renaming of the position but a change in its status that made it the same as the chief judge of other inferior courts.

== Succession of seats ==

The court has eleven seats for active judges after the elimination of Seat 8 under the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. The seat that was originally the chief justiceship is numbered as Seat 1; the other seats are numbered in order of their creation. If seats were established simultaneously, they are numbered in the order in which they were filled. Judges who retire into senior status remain on the bench but leave their seat vacant. That seat is filled by the next circuit judge appointed by the president.

<text>The Indian Swiftlet or Indian Edible-Nest Swiftlet (Aerodramus unicolor) is a small swift. It is a common resident colonial breeder in the hills of Sri Lanka and south west India.

The half-cup nest is built on a vertical surface, often in a cave. The male swift uses thick saliva to construct the white, shiny nest into which two eggs are laid.

The relatively tasteless nests are harvested, and mixed with chicken, spices, and other flavours as bird&#x27;s nest soup, a supposed aphrodisiac.

This 12 cm long species is mainly dark brown above and paler brown below. It has swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. The body is slender, and the tail is short and only slightly indented.

Both sexes and young birds are similar. The Indian swiftlet has very short legs which it uses only for clinging to vertical surfaces, since swifts never settle voluntarily on the ground.

These swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their bills, and they drink on the wing.

<doc id="575318" wikidata="Q327154" url="?curid=575318" title="Hans Christian Andersen Award">
<text>The Hans Christian Andersen Awards are two literary awards given by the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY), recognising one living author and one living illustrator for their &quot;lasting contribution to children&#x27;s literature&quot;. The writing award was first given in 1956, the illustration award in 1966. The former is sometimes called the &quot;Nobel Prize for children&#x27;s literature&quot;.

The awards are named after Hans Christian Andersen, a 19th-century Danish author of fairy tales, and each winner receives the Hans Christian Andersen Medaille (a gold medal with the bust of Andersen) and a diploma. Medals are presented at the biennial IBBY Congress.

== History ==
The International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) was founded by Jella Lepman in the 1950s. The Hans Christian Andersen Award was first proposed in 1953 and awarded three years later, in 1956. It was established in the aftermath of World War II to encourage the development of high-quality children&#x27;s books. The award was set to be given biennially and was initially awarded for individual works that had been published in the preceding two years. By 1962, the award&#x27;s formal criteria were amended &quot;to a living author who is judged to have made a lasting contribution to good juvenile literature by the outstanding value of his or her work. The author&#x27;s complete works, in particular those in fiction, will be taken into consideration in awarding the medal.&quot;

Runners up were listed in 1960, 1962, and 1964. In reflection of what IBBY considered to be a trend of increasing quality in picture books, the award was expanded to include illustrators in 1966. From 1966 to 1996 runners up were named as &quot;Highly Commended&quot;. In 1998, this was replaced with a list of three to four &quot;Finalists&quot;. It is sometimes called the &quot;Little Nobel Prize&quot; or the &quot;Nobel Prize for children&#x27;s literature&quot; and has been cited as the &quot;most important activity&quot; of IBBY. Between 1992 and 2022, the patron of the awards was Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. A special issue of &quot;Bookbird&quot;, a journal published by IBBY, is published as the award is given out.

==Jury==
The winner of the Hans Christian Andersen Awards is selected by a jury which is put together by IBBY&#x27;s executive committee. The Jury&#x27;s president is elected by IBBY&#x27;s General Assembly. There were initially seven jurors, but this was increased to eight and in 2000 to ten. Two years later, the jury was split with five members focusing on writing and the other five handling illustrations. The jurors are expected to be competent in children&#x27;s literature and ideally represent a diverse group. It generally takes six months to review candidates and select a winner. 

Jella Lepman served as Jury President for the first three Andersen Awards, 1956 to 1960, and remained on the jury until her death in 1970, as the President of IBBY and then as its honorary president. Current four-year terms cover two award cycles. Other notable presidents have included Virginia Haviland (1970–1974), Patricia Crampton (1982–1986), and Ana Maria Machado (1986–1990).

==Selection process==
The award&#x27;s regulations read: &quot;The Hans Christian Award is presented every two years by IBBY to an author and to an illustrator, living at the time of the nomination, who by the outstanding value of their work are judged to have made a lasting contribution to literature for children and young people. The complete works of the author and the illustrator will be taken into consideration in the selection process&quot;. The award is explicitly designed to be an &quot;international&quot; work, and it is not explicitly given to a certain country.

IBBY has many member nationsall countries are eligible for membership. Every member nation has its own organization, known as a &quot;national section&quot;, that is active across the country. All member nations can nominate candidates for consideration in the Hans Christian Andersen Awards. Some member states will repeatedly nominate the same author or illustrator, others nominate a new candidate each time. To nominate a candidate, a dossier is prepared that provides information including a list of works and biographical sketch. The portfolio must have between five and ten books by the candidate, which are sent to jurors, IBBY&#x27;s president, and the &quot;Jury Secretary&quot;. There were sixty-six nominees from thirty-three countries for the 2022 Hans Christian Andersen awards.

Each winner receives the Hans Christian Andersen Medaille, a gold medal with the bust of Andersen, and a diploma. These medals are presented at the biennial IBBY Congress.

==Writing award winners==

== Winners by country ==
The winners are most often residents of Europe and North America; the first winner from outside that region was Farshid Mesghali in 1974, from Iran. After receiving the award, many authors and illustrators have their works gain wider recognition, particularly in the form of more translations. there have been award winners from 29 countries. Americans have won the most writing awards (6) and have the most award winners (7). Germans have won the most illustration awards with four.

<doc id="575323" wikidata="Q79160" url="?curid=575323" title="Kisimul Castle">
<text>Kisimul Castle () and also known as Kiessimul Castle, is a medieval castle located on a small island off Castlebay, Barra, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. It gets its name from the Norse &quot;ciosamul&quot;, meaning &quot;castle island&quot;.

==History==
The earliest documentary record of Kisimul Castle dates from the mid 16th century. Writing in 1549, Dean Monro stated of Barra that &quot;Within the southwest end of this isle, ther enters a salt water loche, verey narrow in the entrey, and round and braide within. Into the middis of the saide loche there is ane ile, upon ane strenthey craige, callit Kiselnin, perteining to M’Kneil of Barray.&quot; However, Campbell (1936) points out that Monro has in part confused the nearby &quot;Bàgh Beag&quot; with &quot;Bàgh a&#x27; Chaisteil&quot;.

The castle is built on a rocky islet in the bay, just off the coast of Barra. It can only be reached by boat. Kisimul has its own fresh water wells. Legend has it that was the stronghold of the MacNeils since the 11th century.

Kisimul was abandoned in 1838 when the island was sold, and the castle&#x27;s condition subsequently deteriorated. Some of its stone was used as ballast for fishing vessels, and some even ended up as paving in Glasgow. The remains of the castle, along with most of the island of Barra, were purchased in 1937 by Robert Lister MacNeil, the then chief of Clan MacNeil, who made efforts at restoration.

In 2001 the castle was leased by the chief of Clan MacNeil to Historic Scotland for 1000 years for the annual sum of £1 and a bottle of whisky. For the 2011 census the island was classified by the National Records of Scotland as an inhabited island that &quot;had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses&quot;.

==Archaeological survey==

Archaeological investigations were carried out at Kisimul Castle by Headland Archaeology, on behalf of Historic Scotland. This involved some excavation, building recording and archival research. It was hoped that the project would help clarify the date of the castle and its sequence of construction. Another aim was to establish whether or not the island had been occupied before construction of the castle.

The dating of the castle was particularly difficult due to the lack of datable architectural features visible in the castle fabric. The results of the building recording and archival research concluded a likely date of construction during the late 15th century coinciding with the height of Gaelic power in Scotland and Ireland during the Middle Ages. Records make no mention of it during the reign of Robert II (1371–1390), in the island descriptions in the Chronica Gentis Scotorum (1371–1387) or in the initial grant of the island of Barra to the MacNeills from 1427. This ‘negative’ evidence supports the hypothesis that Kisimul postdates these records since it presumably would have been mentioned if it existed during those times.
It is possible that timber hoardings were a part of the original castle design, due to the presence of putlog holes in the curtain wall. However the holes are not level with the wall walk as would be expected of this particular building feature. As this trend was going out of fashion at the time when Kisimul was built it is thought that they had a more decorative, than defensive function, such as providing extra space for people to walk and exercise in a castle where its location meant that space for such activities was limited.
Excavation concentrated on areas of the courtyard, the basement of the tower and the bottom of a pit prison. At the east end of the courtyard there was a great deal of building rubble directly below the surface, some of which had mortar attached. This suggested that an earlier building had been demolished or collapsed, and the stone used to form a level courtyard. This happened before the building known as the kitchen was built. At the other end of the site a stone drain leading under the great hall was uncovered together with a paved stone surface. Above these was a layer containing large amounts of animal bone, shell and pottery. There were also floor surfaces within buildings that had been demolished.

During the excavation many things were found. These included large quantities of animal bone and shell. Further study of these will allow us to discover more about the diet of those who lived in the castle. A large quantity of broken pottery was also found and appears to range in date from prehistoric times through the medieval period to the more recent past. A number of pieces of flint were recovered including a particularly fine flint blade. These tools together with some of the pottery show that people were using the island thousands of years before the present castle was built.

<doc id="575336" wikidata="Q4179508" url="?curid=575336" title="Benjamin Thompson (architect)">
<text>Benjamin C. Thompson (July 3, 1918 – August 17, 2002) was an American architect. He was one of eight architects who founded The Architects Collaborative (TAC) in 1945 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the most notable firms in post-war modernism, and then started his own firm, Benjamin Thompson and Associates (BTA), in 1967.

==Early life and education==
Thompson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Benjamin C Thompson and Lillian Mudge. He spent early years on his family&#x27;s farm, and received his early education at St. Paul Academy and at Avon Old Farms School, a progressive school founded by architect Theodate Pope Riddle in Avon, Connecticut. His interest in architecture was nurtured by travels in Europe with his mother, an artist and art collector. In the fall of 1938 he entered the Yale School of Architecture, where he earned a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1941. He served for four years in the United States Navy during World War II as a Lieutenant aboard a Destroyer Escort in the North Atlantic and Pacific theaters. He completed his service in the Office of Strategic Services, and provided design services at the United Nations founding conference in San Francisco.

Near the end of the war, Thompson&#x27;s ship docked in Boston, and he was introduced to Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus School and then head of the Harvard Graduate School of Design.

== Career ==
===The Architects Collaborative===
Thompson began his architectural career in 1946 as one of seven founders of The Architects Collaborative (TAC) which also included Norman C. Fletcher, Jean B. Fletcher, John C. Harkness, Sarah P. Harkness, Robert S. McMillan and Louis A. McMillen. The young architects persuaded the well-known Bauhaus founder, Walter Gropius, to join the firm and provide them with guidance. Their first project was an innovative, modernist development in Lexington, Massachusetts which they named Six Moon Hill. All of the TAC founders settled there in houses they collaboratively designed, with the exception of Gropius who had already built his home, Gropius House in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

TAC&#x27;s philosophy led them to emphasize collaboration as opposed celebrating individual &quot;stars.&quot; They did however use the term &quot;partner in charge&quot; to identify the people with primary responsibility for a particular project. Thompson&#x27;s first project for an educational institution was a set of new buildings for the historic Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts (begun in 1959). Thompson was partner in charge for three major building groups for Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts during an 11-year period beginning 1961. These were the Academic Quadrangle (1961), the Social Science Center (1961, three buildings), and the East Quadrangle (1964). On the occasion of the university&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1999, it was observed that &quot;[no other architect] has contributed more to the overall campus image than Benjamin Thompson&quot;. Thompson relied on a consistent vocabulary at Brandeis: low horizontal structures with heavy, flat overhanging roofs; structural concrete frames with non-bearing exterior walls; few visual tricks or trendiness; and an &quot;almost Japanese attitude toward composition and siting&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s buildings for Brandeis include:

* David &amp; Irene Schwartz Hall (1961)
* Schiffman Humanities Center (1961)

Other projects for which Thompson was primarily responsible while at TAC include Greylock Quadrangle (1964-1965) at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

In 1966 Thompson left TAC to form his own firm, Benjamin Thompson &amp; Associates (BTA). As described by his son, Anthony Thompson, his strong entrepreneurial spirit and individualism were at cross purposes to TAC&#x27;s focus on &quot;communal housing and social responsibility.&quot; Jane Thompson also noted a &quot;divergence of convictions&quot; with many partners not seeing the value to TAC of the Design Research line of work Thompson had initiated.

===Design Research===
In 1953, he founded Design Research in Cambridge, a company that provided interior furnishings and accessories. His iconic five-story, all-glass showcase retail store for Design Research was opened in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1968. Design Research was the first US importer and retailer of the Finnish clothing and textiles of Marimekko. The firm eventually added stores in New York (1964) and San Francisco (1965). In 1969, he designed the company&#x27;s revolutionary second Cambridge store, notable for its extreme openness and use of glass. In 1970, Thompson lost financial control and ownership of Design Research.

===Festival Marketplaces===
Thompson is probably best known for his creation of the Faneuil Hall Marketplace (1976) in Boston, Massachusetts which incorporated the historic Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market buildings. In this and other similar projects his firm worked in collaboration with the firm of developer James W. Rouse. In this work, he also worked closely with Jane Fiske Thompson, who later became his second wife and frequent collaborator. The Marketplace epitomized Thompson&#x27;s perspective that vital cities required people to interact with art directly, and that good food, lively design, and commerce can all be part of the experience. This project was an early example of the now widely employed &quot;adaptive reuse&quot; of historic buildings that have outlived their original purposes. Thompson &amp; Rouse were likely inspired by an earlier Boston project featuring reuse of a historic building by Carl Koch. In 1973, Koch, functioning as both architect and developer, had transformed the beautiful but obsolete Lewis Wharf warehouses into luxury condominiums.

In the following decade, Thompson and Rouse worked together on other festival marketplaces including Harborplace (Baltimore, 1980), South Street Seaport (New York, 1985), Bayside Marketplace (Miami, 1987), and Jacksonville Landing (Jacksonville, 1987).

===Practice and teaching===
Thompson&#x27;s interest in modernism was balanced by appreciation of older architecture. In the late 1950s, he renovated Harvard Yard&#x27;s historic dormitories by updating their interior arrangements without visible exterior effect. Shortly thereafter he persuaded Harvard to remodel Boylston Hall (built 1857) rather than demolish it.

During those years, Thompson taught architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and served as Chair of the Architecture Department 1964–1968. His 1966 essay, “Visual Squalor and Social Disorder”, argued for an urban architecture that would encourage, rather than discourage, joy and social life. To this end, in 1967 he proposed reviving Boston&#x27;s obsolescent, historic wholesale food markets with food stalls, cafes, restaurants, and pushcarts appealing to the general public.

== Honors ==
Thompson received honorary doctorates from Colby College, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In 1987, BTA received the AIA Firm Award and in 1992, Thompson received the highest honor in American architecture, the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects.

==Personal life==
Benjamin Thompson was first married to Mary Okes Thompson from 1942 to 1967. The Thompsons lived on Six Moon Hill, an innovative residential development in Lexington, Massachusetts that was one of TAC&#x27;s earliest projects. She continued to live there until her death in 2004. They had five children. In 1959, they purchased a seven-acre waterfront property in Barnstable where the family spent summers together.

Thompson&#x27;s second marriage was in 1969 to Jane Fiske McCullough, a writer and design critic, who handled his public relations and later became a collaborator on certain of his planning projects. He was Jane&#x27;s fourth husband. They lived in Cambridge and Barnstable. Ben died in August 17, 2002 in his Cambridge home.

<text>The quinarius (plural: quinarii) was a small silver Roman coin valued at half a denarius.

The quinarius was struck for a few years, along with the silver sestertius, following the introduction of the denarius in 211 BC. At this time the quinarius was valued at 5 asses. The coin was reintroduced in 101 BC as a replacement for the victoriatus, this time valued at 8 asses due to retariffing of the denarius to 16 asses in 118 BC. For a few years following its reintroduction, large quantities of quinarii were produced, mostly for circulation in Gaul. The coin was produced sporadically until the 3rd century. Its symbol is 𐆗.

The term &quot;gold quinarius&quot; or &quot;quinarius aureus&quot; is used to describe the half-aureus, which is valued at 12.5 denarii. This term has no ancient authority.

<doc id="575343" wikidata="Q7565045" url="?curid=575343" title="The Original Soupman">
<text>The Original Soupman was a chain of soup restaurants originally run by Iranian-American soup vendor Ali &quot;Al&quot; Yeganeh (), modeled after Yeganeh&#x27;s original restaurant Soup Kitchen International, which was a well-known soup restaurant at 259-A West 55th Street (between Broadway and 8th Avenue), in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The restaurant was known for its strict rules amongst its customers.

The 55th Street location, which began operating in 1984, was closed in 2004, with the windows soaped over. Yeganeh kept the lease on the shop while he looked to expand into a broader market. This led to the formation of the Original Soup Man chain and eventually led to the reopening of the Soup Kitchen International location in 2010 under the name &quot;Original Soup Man&quot;, like all of Yeganeh&#x27;s other restaurants.

In 2017, the chief financial officer of The Original Soupman was indicted for income tax evasion, and the chain went into bankruptcy, which led to all of its stores being closed. Later in 2017, the chain emerged from bankruptcy under new ownership, and it re-opened in the original location in late 2018, going by its former name The Original Soup Kitchen. Although Yeganeh is not involved with the day-to-day operations anymore, he still owns the brand name and is in charge of the soup recipes.

==Original restaurant==

In a profile of Yeganeh and Soup Kitchen International published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1989, both the small restaurant&#x27;s popularity and Yeganeh&#x27;s obsessive focus on his customers&#x27; behavior were noted. Yeganeh was quoted in the article as saying &quot;I tell you, I hate to work with the public. They treat me like a slave. My philosophy is: The customer is always wrong and I’m always right.&quot; Yeganeh explained his strict philosophy about customer behavior by noting that, &quot;Whoever follows [my rules] I treat very well. My regular customers don’t say anything. They are very intelligent and well educated. They know I’m just trying to move the line.&quot; However, the writer noted that customers who stalled or complained would be bypassed, and quoted one person in line as advising others, &quot;Just don’t talk. Do what he says.&quot;

==Fame via &quot;Seinfeld&quot;==
Yeganeh was the inspiration for the &quot;Soup Nazi&quot; character in the eponymous episode of the NBC television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which first aired on November 2, 1995. In this episode, Yeganeh, fictionalized as &quot;Yev Kassem&quot;, was portrayed as the tyrannical purveyor of his soups, making all of his customers follow a strict set of rules if they wish to successfully procure a bowl of one of his coveted soups. Kassem was portrayed by Larry Thomas, who made two appearances in the series. For the original episode, Thomas was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 1996.

According to writer Spike Feresten, Jerry Seinfeld and several members of the production team went to Soup Kitchen International for lunch weeks after &quot;The Soup Nazi&quot; aired, despite Feresten warning Seinfeld that Yeganeh was now well aware of the episode and was not pleased with the attention it had brought him. Upon recognizing Seinfeld, Yeganeh &quot;did a triple take&quot; and then went into a profanity-filled rant about how the show had &quot;ruined&quot; his business, demanding an apology. Seinfeld allegedly gave what Feresten describes as &quot;the most sarcastic apology I&#x27;ve ever seen anyone give&quot;, upon which Yeganeh ejected them from the restaurant, shouting &quot;No soup for you!&quot; in the process.

==Franchises==

After reopening, &quot;The Original Soup Man&quot; opened franchises in various cities throughout the United States and Canada, including four in Manhattan. The soups were made in Yeganeh&#x27;s industrial kitchen in Linden, New Jersey. Yeganeh licensed his recipes, name, and likeness to the company. Franchises were provided with some 45 soup varieties in bags available in rotation. Chains participating in subfranchising the soups included Ranch One and Cold Stone Creamery. On March 3, 2008, the first Original Soup Man franchise on a college campus was opened in the Russell House University Union at the University of South Carolina. This venue closed near the end of spring 2011.

Reportedly, the strictness popularized by the original location need not necessarily be followed by the franchisees, but Yeganeh banned any Soup Nazi references by franchises and their staff while on the job and has strongly encouraged his franchise owners to avoid references to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in their promotions. (However, his marketing contains at least two &quot;Seinfeld&quot; references, the phrase &quot;Soup for you!&quot; and a mention of the show on the back of his packaged soup offerings.) At the time, Yeganeh accepted media inquiries, but his &quot;media rules&quot; forbade mention of &quot;the &#x27;N&#x27; word&quot; (Nazi), personal questions, or follow-up questions. Interviews were conducted only via e-mail.

Despite Yeganeh&#x27;s contempt for the Soup Nazi character, it was announced on July 22, 2015 that Soupman, Inc. licensed the image of actor Larry Thomas, who portrayed the &quot;Soup Nazi&quot; character on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, to promote Yeganeh&#x27;s soups across America.

== Grocery store offerings ==
Soup Kitchen International Inc., &quot;The Original Soupman,&quot; and Yeganeh announced on April 22, 2005, that a retail line of &quot;heat-n-serve&quot; soups would be available in May at select grocery stores. There were five different variations available made by SoBe Beverages and supervised by Al Yeganeh. The soups were packaged in 15 oz. ‘Grab-N-Go’ clear packages. Since its launch in May 2005, &quot;The Original Soupman&quot; line of soups has been sold in 14 states and over 7,000 grocery stores across the United States and Canada.

==Bankruptcy and relaunch==
In May 2017, Robert Bertrand, the chief financial officer of The Original Soupman, was arrested and charged with income tax evasion for failure to pay the company&#x27;s Medicare, Social Security, and federal income taxes dating back to 2010. Less than two months later, the chain filed for bankruptcy. All of the company&#x27;s assets, including its licenses from Yeganeh and its license of the image of Larry Thomas, were sold in a bankruptcy sale in September 2017 to a company called Gallant Brands, headed by Joseph Hagan. All of the company&#x27;s physical locations were closed at that time, most of its major customers were lost, and the company only continued to operate its grocery store sales business.

In April 2018, Bertrand pled guilty and was sentenced to nine months in prison; his defense was that his actions were intended to keep the company afloat. Around that time, The Original Soupman was able to re-enter New York City&#x27;s public schools lunch program after some modifications to the recipes, then to expand sales to delis and supermarkets in the New York City area, and finally, in December 2018, it opened its first post-bankruptcy physical location in a Times Square kiosk. , it does not have a web presence.

==Other popular culture==
The &quot;Soup Nazi&quot; character in &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was not the first time that Yeganeh was referenced in film. According to Nora Ephron&#x27;s DVD commentary, the first pop culture reference to Yeganeh (though not by name) occurs in the 1993 movie &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, which Ephron co-wrote and directed. In the film, a magazine writer discusses a potential story: &quot;This man sells the greatest soup you have ever eaten, and he is the meanest man in America. I feel very strongly about this, Becky; it&#x27;s not just about the soup.&quot;

<text>Anna Marie &quot;Patty&quot; Duke (December 14, 1946 – March 29, 2016) was an American actress. Over the course of her acting career, she was the recipient of an Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

At age 15, Duke portrayed Helen Keller in the film &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1962), a role she had originated on Broadway. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. The following year, she played the dual role of &quot;identical cousins&quot; Cathy and Patty Lane on her own network television series &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; (1963–1966). She progressed to more mature roles, such as Neely O&#x27;Hara in the film &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967) and Natalie Miller in the film &quot;Me, Natalie&quot; (1969). The latter earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. From 1985 to 1988, she served as president of the Screen Actors Guild.

Duke was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1982. Following her diagnosis, she devoted much of her time to advocating for and educating the public on mental health. She was also an occasional singer and author.

==Early life==
Patty Duke was born Anna Marie Duke on December 14, 1946 at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan to Frances Margaret (née McMahon) (1913–1993), a cashier, and John Patrick Duke (1913–1964), a handyman and cab driver, who was of Irish descent. She was the youngest of three children. She was raised Roman Catholic.

Duke spent her early life in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, where her brother Raymond, her sister Carol, and she experienced a difficult childhood. Their father was an alcoholic, and their mother suffered from clinical depression and was prone to violence. When Duke was six, her mother forced her father to leave the family home. When Duke was eight, her care was turned over to talent managers John and Ethel Ross who, after promoting Patty&#x27;s brother, were looking for a girl to add to their stable of child actors.

The Rosses&#x27; methods of managing Duke&#x27;s career were often unscrupulous and exploitative. They consistently billed Duke as being two years younger than she actually was and padded her resume with false credits. They gave her alcohol and prescription drugs, took unreasonably high fees from her earnings, and made sexual advances to her. She never saw her father and saw her mother only when she visited to do the Rosses&#x27; laundry. In addition, the Rosses made Duke change her name. &quot;Anna Marie is dead,&quot; they said. &quot;You&#x27;re Patty now.&quot; They hoped that Patty Duke would duplicate the success of Patty McCormack.

==Career==
===Acting===
====1950s–1990s====
One of Duke&#x27;s early acting roles was in the late 1950s on the soap opera &quot;The Brighter Day.&quot; She also appeared in print ads and in television commercials. In 1959, at the age of 12, Duke was a contestant on &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; and won $32,000; her category of expertise, according to her autobiography &quot;Call Me Anna&quot;, was popular music. The game show was revealed to have been rigged, and she was called to testify before a panel of the United States Senate. Duke eventually testified before congressional investigators and broke into tears when she admitted she had been coached to speak falsely.

Also in 1959, Duke appeared in a television adaptation of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; as Tootie Smith, the role that had originated in the film version by Margaret O&#x27;Brien. Duke&#x27;s first major starring role was Helen Keller (with Anne Bancroft as Anne Sullivan), in the Broadway play &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;, which ran from October 1959 to July 1961. Duke originated the role of Keller on Broadway, although Patty McCormack actually originated the role in its earlier original presentation as a live television drama on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. During the run, Duke&#x27;s name was elevated above the play&#x27;s title on the theater&#x27;s billboard, believed to be the first time this had been done for such a young star. The play was subsequently made into a 1962 film for which Duke received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Before the film started shooting, the actress and activist Helen Keller briefly met. At 16, Duke was the youngest person at that time to have received an Academy Award in a competitive category. Duke returned to television, this time starring with Laurence Olivier and George C. Scott in a television production of &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (1961).

Duke&#x27;s own series, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, created by Sidney Sheldon especially for her, in the wake of the 1961 Walt Disney hit movie &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; with Hayley Mills as identical twins. The series premiered two years after &quot;Parent Trap&quot;, in September 1963. At that time, Duke had not been diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, but Sheldon did notice that she had two distinct sides to her personality, so he developed the concept of identical cousins with contrasting personalities. Duke portrayed both main characters: Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Lane, a fun-loving American teenager who occasionally got into trouble at school and home, and her prim and proper &quot;identical cousin&quot; from Scotland, Catherine &quot;Cathy&quot; Lane. William Schallert portrayed Patty&#x27;s father, Martin, and his twin brother, Kenneth, Cathy&#x27;s father; Jean Byron played her mother, Natalie; Paul O&#x27;Keefe was her younger brother, Ross; and Eddie Applegate portrayed her boyfriend, Richard Harrison (though the actor was more than a decade older than Duke). The show also featured such high-profile guest stars as Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Paul Lynde, and Sal Mineo. The series lasted three seasons and earned Duke an Emmy Award nomination. In 1999, the program&#x27;s characters were revisited and updated in &quot;The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin&#x27; in Brooklyn Heights&quot;, with Cindy Williams taking on the villain role of Sue Ellen Turner when Kitty Sullivan was unable to reprise her role.

After the cancellation of &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; in 1966, Duke began her adult acting career by playing Neely O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967). The film was a box-office success, but audiences and critics had a difficult time accepting all-American-teenager Duke as an alcoholic, drug-addicted singing star. While the film has since become a camp classic—thanks in large part to Duke&#x27;s over-the-top performance—at the time it almost ruined her career. In 1969, Duke starred in &quot;Me, Natalie&quot;, in which she played an &quot;ugly duckling&quot; Brooklyn teenager struggling to make a life for herself in the Bohemian world of Greenwich Village. Duke won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (Musical or Comedy) for the role.
Duke returned to television in 1970, starring in a made-for-TV movie, &quot;My Sweet Charlie&quot;. Her portrayal of a pregnant teenager on the run won Duke her first Emmy Award. Her acceptance speech was rambling and disjointed, leading many in the industry to believe she was drunk or using drugs at the time. In fact, Duke was experiencing a manic phase of her bipolar disorder, which remained undiagnosed until 1982. She received her second Emmy in 1977 for the TV miniseries &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; and her third in 1980 for a TV version of her 1979 stage revival of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;, this time playing Anne Sullivan to Melissa Gilbert&#x27;s Helen Keller. Her turns in the made-for-TV movies &quot;The Women&#x27;s Room&quot; (1980) and &quot;George Washington&quot; (1984) both garnered her Emmy nominations. In the 1980s, Duke was cast in a number of short-lived TV series. The ABC sitcom &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, from &quot;Soap&quot; and &quot;Benson&quot; creator Susan Harris, was cancelled after one season; &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot;, in which she appeared as the first female President of the United States; and a comedy, &quot;Karen&#x27;s Song&quot;, which aired on the fledgling Fox network.

Duke&#x27;s film roles in the 1980s included the Canadian film &quot;By Design&quot; (1981), which garnered her a Genie Award nomination for Best Foreign Actress, and the made-for-TV movie &quot;A Time to Triumph&quot; (1986), the true story of Concetta Hassan, a woman who struggles to support her family after her husband is injured, but who eventually becomes a United States Army helicopter pilot. In 1990, Duke&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Call Me Anna,&quot; was adapted for television; she played herself from her mid-30s onward. In 1992, Duke portrayed the mother of Meg Ryan&#x27;s character in the film adaptation of the play &quot;Prelude to a Kiss.&quot; Duke received an Emmy nomination in 1999 for her appearances in three episodes of &quot;Touched by an Angel.&quot;

In 1985, Duke became the second woman, after Kathleen Nolan, to be elected president of the Screen Actors Guild, a post she held until 1988. Her tenure as president was marked by factional in-fighting and controversy; however, she gained respect for managing to maintain solidarity among the guild&#x27;s members. During her term, she led industrial actions and contract negotiations and oversaw the relocation of the guild&#x27;s headquarters.

====Later years====
Duke gradually reduced her work schedule in the 2000s but took occasional TV roles, including guest appearances on shows such as &quot;Glee&quot; and the reboot of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. In 2011, she joined the cast of the drama &quot;The Protector.&quot; She also returned to the stage on occasion—in 2002 as Aunt Eller in a revival of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; on Broadway and in 2009 as Madame Morrible in the San Francisco production of the musical &quot;Wicked.&quot; In May 2011, Duke directed the stage version of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; at the now defunct Interplayers Theater in Spokane, Washington. In 2010, she hosted a PBS TV special &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling: An Irish Parade Of Stars&quot;. The special was part of the My Music series and featured Irish and Irish-American folk music and sentimental standards.

In 2011, Duke appeared in public service announcements for the U.S. government, promoting the Social Security website. In several, she appeared as Patty and Cathy using split-screen effects. In others, she appeared with George Takei wearing a &quot;Star Trek&quot;-like costume. In 2015, Duke made her final TV appearance, guest-starring on &quot;Liv and Maddie&quot; as Grandma Janice and Great-aunt Hilary, a pair of identical twins.

===Singing===

Like many teen stars of the era, and bolstered somewhat by her appearance in the musical &quot;Billie&quot;, Duke had a successful singing career, including two top-40 hits in 1965, &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Stand There&quot; (number eight) and &quot;Say Something Funny&quot; (number 22). She also performed on TV shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

===Mental health advocacy===
In 1987, Duke revealed in her autobiography that she had been diagnosed with manic depression (now called bipolar disorder) in 1982, becoming one of the first public figures to speak out about her personal experience of mental illness. She also suffered from anorexia nervosa and during her teenaged years, weighed as little as 76 pounds. She attempted suicide in 1967 and was again hospitalized for mental health problems in 1969, eventually being diagnosed as manic depressive in 1982. Her treatment, which included the use of lithium as medication and therapy, successfully stabilized her moods. She subsequently became an activist for mental health causes. She lobbied the United States Congress and joined forces with the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Alliance on Mental Illness to increase awareness, funding, and research for people with mental illness. In 2007, Duke appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show,&quot; talking about her bipolar disorder.

===Memoirs===
Duke wrote three books. Her autobiography, &quot;Call Me Anna&quot; () was published in 1987 and &quot;Brilliant Madness: Living with Manic Depressive Illness&quot; () was published in 1992.
The third, &quot;In The Presence of Greatness—My Sixty Year Journey as an Actress&quot; () (with William J. Jankowski), published posthumously in February 2018, is a collection of essays about her experiences with other artists and celebrities.

==Recognition==
Over the course of her career, Duke received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, three Emmy Awards in 10 nominations, and two Golden Globe Awards amongst four nominations. In 1963, when she won her Academy Award, Duke became the youngest person to ever win an Academy Award in a competitive category.

On August 17, 2004, Duke received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to the motion-picture industry. On December 14, 2007, her 61st birthday, Duke was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters degree from the University of North Florida for her work in advancing awareness of mental health issues. On March 6, 2010, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters degree from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.

==Personal life==
Duke was married four times and had three children. A Catholic, Duke had dreams of becoming a nun in her youth. In her later life, she studied a number of different religions, commenting in 1995: &quot;To suggest that one must spout Moses or Jesus or Buddha or chant like Tibetan monks in order to be religious, I believe, is not to walk in the path of Christ... I have been a Christian Scientist. If there&#x27;s a religious definition of &#x27;dabbler&#x27;, I guess that would be me. I have studied Buddhism. There was a time when I very seriously considered Judaism. And, yes, I do go to church now. I go to a Unity Church. I also go to Catholic church occasionally because the child in me desperately needs the bells and smells.&quot;

In 1965, at age 18, Duke married director Harry Falk, who was 13 years her senior. It led to the end of Duke&#x27;s relationship with her childhood guardians, the Rosses. During their marriage, she had repeated mood swings, drank heavily, became anorexic, and overdosed on pills a number of times. The couple divorced in 1969.

In early 1970, at age 23, Duke became involved with three men at the same time: 17-year-old &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; star Desi Arnaz Jr., actor John Astin (who was 16 years her senior), and rock music promoter Michael Tell. The relationship with Arnaz was widely publicized, due in part to the vocal and public opposition of Arnaz&#x27;s mother, actress and production company executive Lucille Ball. By late spring, Duke and Arnaz had broken off their relationship.

In June 1970, Duke learned that she was pregnant; she then married Michael Tell on June 26, 1970, during a manic phase, to &quot;give (her child) a name.&quot; Their marriage lasted 13 days before ending in an annulment on July 9, 1970. Her son, actor Sean Astin, was born on February 25, 1971; she later told him that Arnaz was his biological father. Duke wrote in her 1987 autobiography that the marriage to Tell was never consummated, and that Astin was Sean&#x27;s biological father, emphasizing those two assertions in several parts of the book. Both of her statements on these matters appear to have been incorrect: in 1994, biological tests determined that Tell was Sean&#x27;s biological father.

Duke married John Astin on August 5, 1972. Astin adopted Sean, and the couple had a son together, actor Mackenzie Astin. Duke and Astin worked together extensively during their marriage, and she took his name professionally, becoming &quot;Patty Duke Astin&quot;. During this period, Duke underwent a hysterectomy. Duke also adopted Astin&#x27;s other three sons; years later in 1998, they reversed the adoption with Duke&#x27;s approval. The couple divorced in 1985.

Duke married her fourth husband, drill sergeant Michael Pearce, in 1986, and remained married to him until her death 30 years later. Duke and Pearce had met during the production of &quot;A Time to Triumph&quot;, for which Pearce served as a consultant. Pearce had two daughters, Raelene and Charlene, whom Duke became an enthusiastic stepmother to. The couple moved to Hayden, Idaho, and adopted a son, Kevin, who was born in 1988. From her marriage to Pearce until her death in 2016, Duke occasionally used the name &quot;Anna Duke-Pearce&quot; in her writings and other professional work.

Duke had three granddaughters by her eldest son Sean, actresses Alexandra, Elizabeth, and Isabella.

==Death==
Duke died on the morning of March 29, 2016 in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, of sepsis from a ruptured intestine at the age of 69. Her son Sean Astin invited the public to contribute to a mental-health foundation in his mother&#x27;s name, the Patty Duke Mental Health Initiative. She was cremated and her ashes were interred at Forest Cemetery in Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

<doc id="575347" wikidata="Q1098125" url="?curid=575347" title="Threshold of pain">
<text>The threshold of pain or pain threshold is the point along a curve of increasing perception of a stimulus at which pain begins to be felt. It is an entirely subjective phenomenon. A distinction must be maintained between the stimulus (an external thing that can be directly measured, such as with a thermometer) and the person&#x27;s or animal&#x27;s resulting pain perception (an internal, subjective thing that can sometimes be measured indirectly, such as with a visual analog scale). Although an IASP document defines &quot;pain threshold&quot; as &quot;the minimum intensity of a stimulus that is perceived as painful&quot;, it then goes on to say (contradictorily in letter although not in spirit) that:
Traditionally the threshold has often been defined, as we defined it formerly, as the least stimulus intensity at which a subject perceives pain. Properly defined, the threshold is really the experience of the patient, whereas the intensity measured is an external event. It has been common usage for most pain research workers to define the threshold in terms of the stimulus, and that should be avoided ... The stimulus is not pain (q.v.) and cannot be a measure of pain. 
Although the phrasing may not convey it perfectly, the distinction clearly meant is the aforementioned one between the stimulus and the perception of it. The intensity at which a stimulus (e.g., heat, pressure) begins to evoke pain is thus called by a separate term, &quot;threshold intensity&quot;. So, if a hotplate on a person&#x27;s skin begins to hurt at 42 °C (107 °F), that is the &quot;pain threshold temperature&quot; for that bit of skin at that time. It is not the pain threshold (which is internal/subjective) but the temperature at which the pain threshold was crossed (which is external/objective).

The intensity at which a stimulus begins to evoke pain varies from individual to individual and for a given individual over time.

==Heat==
The temperature at which heat becomes painful for a recipient is called the &quot;heat pain threshold&quot; for that person at that time.
One study showed that morning-oriented people have higher pain threshold for heat as compared to evening-oriented individuals.

==Hearing==
The pressure at which sound becomes painful for a listener is the &quot;pain threshold pressure&quot; for that person at that time. The threshold pressure for sound varies with frequency and can be age-dependent. People who have been exposed to more noise/music usually have a higher threshold pressure. &quot;Threshold shift&quot; can also cause threshold pressure to vary. Prolonged exposure to sound at levels evoking pain can cause physical damage, potentially leading to hearing impairment and tinnitus.

The volume in acoustics refers to loudness. It is a common term for the amplitude of sound or the sound pressure level. Different values for pain threshold pressure level and pain threshold pressure are found in the literature:

<doc id="575356" wikidata="Q948156" url="?curid=575356" title="Guillaume Postel">
<text>Guillaume Postel (25 March 1510 – 6 September 1581) was a French linguist, Orientalist, astronomer, Christian Kabbalist, diplomat, polyglot, professor, religious universalist, and writer.

Born in the village of Barenton in Normandy, Postel made his way to Paris to further his education. While studying at the Collège Sainte-Barbe, he became acquainted with Ignatius of Loyola and many of the men who would become the founders of the Society of Jesus, retaining a lifelong affiliation with them. He entered Rome in the novitiate of the Jesuits in March 1544, but left on December 9, 1545 before making religious vows.

==Diplomacy and scholarship==
Postel was adept at Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac and other Semitic languages, as well as the Classical languages of Ancient Greek and Latin, and soon came to the attention of the French court.

===Travel to the Ottoman Empire===
In 1536, when Francis I sought a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Ottoman Turks, he sent Postel as the official interpreter of the French embassy of Jean de La Forêt to the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in Constantinople. Postel was also apparently assigned to gather interesting Eastern manuscripts for the royal library, today housed in the collection of oriental manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.

===Works===
In &quot;Linguarum Duodecim Characteribus Differentium Alphabetum Introductio&quot; (&quot;An Introduction to the Alphabetic Characters of Twelve Different Languages&quot;), published in 1538, Postel became the first scholar to recognize the inscriptions on Judean coins from the period of the First Jewish–Roman War as Hebrew written in the ancient &quot;Samaritan&quot; characters.

In 1543, Postel published a criticism of Protestantism, and highlighted parallels between Islam and Protestantism in &quot;Alcorani seu legis Mahometi et Evangelistarum concordiae liber&quot; (&quot;The book of concord between the Coran and the Evangelicals&quot;).

In 1544, in &quot;De orbis terrae concordia&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Harmony of the Earth&quot;), Postel advocated a universalist world religion. The thesis of the book was that all Jews, Muslims, and Pagans could be converted to Christianity once all of the religions of the world were shown to have common foundations and that the Christian religion best represented these foundations. He believed these foundations to be the love of God, the praising of God, the love of mankind, and the helping of mankind.

In his &quot;De la République des Turcs&quot; (&quot;Of the Turkish Republic&quot;), Postel makes a rather positive description of the Ottoman society. His 1553 &quot;Des merveilles du monde et principalemẽt des admirables choses des Indes &amp; du nouveau monde&quot; is one of the earliest European descriptions of religion in Japan. He interprets Japanese religion in terms of his universalist views on religion, claiming that the indigenous Japanese religion was a form of Christianity and that one could still find evidence of their worship of crucifixes. Such claims about Japanese religion were common in Europe at the time; Postel&#x27;s writings may have influenced Francis Xavier&#x27;s expectations of Japan as he traveled there.

Postel was also a relentless advocate of the unification of all Christian churches, a common concern during the period of the Protestant Reformation, and remarkably tolerant of other faiths during a time when such tolerance was unusual. This tendency led him to work with the Jesuits in Rome and then Venice, but the incompatibility of their doctrine with his beliefs prevented his full membership in their order. Riccioli provides an alternative account in his biography of Postel in &quot;Almagestum Novum&quot; - that Postel was ejected by St. Ignatius from the Jesuits after taking his vows.

===Cartographer===

Postel took an interest in geography in his course of lectures at the Collège Royal, now known as Collège de France, in 1537. He is believed to have spent the years from 1548 to 1551 traveling to the Holy Land and Ottoman Syria, to collect manuscripts. After this trip, he earned the appointment of Professor of Mathematics and Oriental Languages at the Collège Royal. In 1552, he published a short compendium under the name, &quot;De Universitate Liber&quot;, perhaps inspired by that of Henricus Glareanus (1527). This geographer had drawn two polar projections which remained in manuscript. Postel expanded upon &quot;De Universitate Liber&quot;, which was published as the &quot;Cosmographicae Disciplinae Compendium&quot; by Johannes Oporinus in Basel, in 1561.

In &quot;Cosmographicae&quot;, Postel clearly set out his ideas on the continents of Asia (&quot;Semia&quot;, after Shem), Africa (&quot;Chamia&quot; or &quot;Chamesia&quot;, after Ham), Europe (&quot;Iapetia&quot;, after Japheth), the Americas (&quot;Atlantides&quot;), and Australia (&quot;Chasdia&quot;, after Cush). He denoted the Americas as &quot;boreal&quot; and &quot;austral&quot;, and distinctly separated them from Australia (&quot;Terre Australle&quot; or &quot;Chasdia&quot;) by the Strait of Magellan (&quot;Fretum Martini Bohemi&quot;). &quot;Chasdia&quot; was a term created by Postel.

====World map and Chasdia====
&quot;Cosmographicae&quot; has an index of 600 names, which Postel included in his 1578 world map, &quot;Polo aptata Nova Charta Universi&quot;. Australia is called &quot;Chasdia&quot; in three places: under the Americas (&quot; residuum Atlantidis meridiana pars&quot;); under the Moluccas (&quot; pars&quot;) where it is joined to an unnamed New Guinea with its Rio Saint Augustin; and under Africa (&quot; pars adhuc incognita&quot;).

To the south of South America, he included the following legend: 
&quot;Ce quart de globe, ou demy Hémisphere contient dedans sa longitude clxxx degrès [180º], partie Australle de l&#x27;Atlantide dicte Peru ou America par Americ Vespuce Florentin son inventeur, et davantage une partie de la Chasdia ou terre Australle vers les Isles Mologa ou Moluques&quot;. (This quarter of the globe, or half hemisphere, contains within its 180 degrees of longitude the southern part of the Atlantide called Peru or America by Florentine Amerigo Vespucci its discoverer, and as well a part of Chasdia or Terra Australis toward the Mologa or Moluccas Islands.)

The South Pole is alluded to:
&quot;Chasdia qui est vers le Gond ou Pole Austral ainsi appellée à cause que de la Meridionale partie ou Australe procede la Misericorde dicte Chassed&quot; (Chasdia which is toward the Hinge or South Pole, so called because from the southern or austral part originates Mercy called Chessed).

Another legend on the same map over the southern continent reads: &quot; seu Australis terra, quam Vulgus nautarum di fuego vocant alii Papagallorum dicunt&quot; (Chasdia or Terra Australis, which the common sailors call Tierra del Fuego and others say is the Land of the Parrots).

Postel’s world map strongly influenced Gerard de Jode and others of the Antwerp school.

===Near East and Central Europe===
After several years, Postel resigned his professorship and traveled throughout Central Europe, including the Habsburg Empire and Renaissance Italy. He returned to France after each trip, often by way of Venice. Through his efforts at manuscript collection, translation, and publishing, he brought many Ancient Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic texts into European intellectual discourse in the Late Renaissance and early modern periods. Among these texts are:

* Euclid&#x27;s Elements, in the version of the astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi;
* An astronomical work by al-Kharaqī, &quot;Muntahā al-idrāk fī taqāsīm al-aflāk&quot; (&quot;The Ultimate Grasp of the Divisions of Spheres&quot;), disputing Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;.
* Astronomical works by al-Tusi and other Arabic astronomers;
* Latin translations of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, and the &quot;Sefer ha-Bahir&quot;, which are works of Jewish Kabbalah, printed in 1552;
* Christian Cabbala texts, such as his own commentary on the significance of the Menorah, which he published in 1548 in Latin and subsequently in Hebrew.

===Two aspects of the soul===
To Postel, the human soul is composed of intellect and emotion, which he envisaged as male and female, head and heart. The soul&#x27;s triadic is through the union of these two halves. Yet Postel did not mean a second incarnation of divinity: his sentiment and language make it clear that he spoke figuratively.

===Heresy and confinement===
While working on his translations of the &quot;Zohar&quot; and the &quot;Bahir&quot; in Venice in 1547, Postel became the confessor of Mother Zuana, an elderly woman who was responsible for the kitchen of the hospital of San Giovanni e Paolo. Zuana confessed to experiencing divine visions, which inspired Postel to believe that she was a prophet, that he was her spiritual son, and that he was destined to be the unifier of the world&#x27;s religions. When he returned from his second journey to the East, he dedicated two works to her memory: &quot;Les Très Merveilleuses Victoire des Femmes du Nouveau Monde&quot; and &quot;La Vergine Venetiana&quot;.

Based on his own visions, these works brought Postel into conflict with the Inquisition. Postel&#x27;s ties, however, with the very men tasked with trying him led to a verdict of insanity, rather than heresy, which could lead to the death penalty, and consequently Postel was confined to the papal prisons in Rome. He was released when the prison was opened upon the death of Paul IV in 1559. Czech Renaissance humanist Šimon Proxenus ze Sudetu (1532–1575), reports that in 1564 Postel was detained to the monastery of St. Martin des Champs in Paris, &quot;because of his delusions on the Mother Jeanne&quot;.

Postel resumed his life in Paris, but the alleged miracle at Laon in 1566 had a profound effect on him, and that year he published an account of it, &quot;De summopere considerando miraculo&quot;, in which he again expounded upon the interrelatedness of all parts of the universe and his imminent restoration of the world order. As a result, he was sentenced to house arrest by the Parlement of Paris, and eventually spent the last eleven years of his life confined to the monastery of St. Martin des Champs. He died in Paris in 1581.

<text>The Truckee River is a river in the U.S. states of California and Nevada. The river flows northeasterly and is long. The Truckee is the sole outlet of Lake Tahoe and drains part of the high Sierra Nevada, emptying into Pyramid Lake in the Great Basin. Its waters are an important source of irrigation along its valley and adjacent valleys.

==Naming of the river==
A Northern Paiute word for the Truckee is Kuyuinahukwa. Kuyui- refers to the Cui-ui, a species of fish endemic to Pyramid Lake which is central to the lives of the Northern Paiute band called the Kuyui Dükadü (cui-ui-fish-eaters).

In the Washo language, different parts of the river have different names. Two names, ‘Át’abi wá’t’a and Á’waku wá’t’a translate to &quot;trout stream.&quot; The latter name refers to the river at and around Pyramid Lake. At the outlet at Lake Tahoe, there are multiple names as well. Dawbayódok is said to refer to the area when one is situated &quot;on the down side&quot; of the outlet, while Dawbayóduwé is used when one is &quot;on the up side.&quot; Debeyúmewe, translated as &quot;coming out,&quot; is less specific.

When John C. Frémont and Kit Carson ascended the Truckee River on January 16, 1844, they called it the Salmon Trout River, after the huge Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi&quot;) that ran up the river from Pyramid Lake to spawn. However, the river was ultimately named after a Paiute chief known as Truckee, who in 1844 guided an emigrant party from the headwaters of the Humboldt River to California via the Truckee River, Donner Lake, and Donner Pass. Appreciative of their Native American guide&#x27;s services, the party named the river after him. The chief&#x27;s real name might not have been Truckee, but perhaps &quot;Tru-ki-zo&quot;, which could have become distorted as &quot;Truckee&quot;. There are numerous other theories about Chief Truckee and his name.

==Course and watershed==

The Truckee River&#x27;s source is the outlet of Lake Tahoe, at the dam on the northwest side of the lake near Tahoe City, California. It flows generally northeast through the mountains to Truckee, California, then turns sharply to the east and flows into Nevada, through Reno and Sparks and along the northern end of the Carson Range. At Fernley it turns north, flowing along the east side of the Pah Rah Range. It empties into the southern end of Pyramid Lake, a remnant of prehistoric Lake Lahontan, in northern Washoe County in the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.

The Truckee River&#x27;s endorheic drainage basin is about , of which about are in Nevada. The Middle Watershed is regarded as the of river and its tributaries from Tahoe City in Placer County, through the Town of Truckee in Nevada County, to the state line between Sierra and Washoe counties. The major tributaries to the Truckee River in California from the Lake Tahoe outlet and heading downstream include: Bear Creek, Washeshu Creek, Cabin Creek, Pole Creek, Donner Creek, Trout Creek, Martis Creek, Prosser Creek, the Little Truckee River, Gray Creek, and Bronco Creek. Major lakes and reservoirs in the California part of the watershed include Lake Tahoe, Donner Lake, Independence Lake (California), Webber Lake, Boca Reservoir, Stampede Reservoir, Prosser Creek Reservoir, and Martis Creek Reservoir. In the Lower Watershed, Steamboat Creek, which drains Washoe Lake, is the major tributary to the Truckee River.

==River modifications==
Like many other rivers in the western United States, the Truckee&#x27;s flow is highly regulated, with most river flow fully allocated through a system of water rights, set in 2015 by the Truckee River Operating Agreement. This system over-allocates available water during low flow periods. Disputes occur among those asserting rights to the water. In the early 20th century, the Newlands Reclamation Act instituted a diversion that removed river flows from the Truckee River watershed and transferred them to the Carson River watershed. Currently the Truckee–Carson Irrigation District supervises the diversion of approximately one-third of the river flow at the Derby Dam to the Lahontan Valley to irrigate alfalfa and pastures. Truckee River water is also supplied to the resort communities surrounding Lake Tahoe, the greater metropolitan area of Reno and Sparks, and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Indian Reservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses some of the water to induce spawning of the endangered fish cui-ui and to provide drought relief.

==Ecology==
Beavers were re-introduced to the Truckee River watershed and Tahoe Basin by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the U. S. Forest Service between 1934 and 1949 in order to prevent stream degradation and to promote wetland restoration. That beaver were once native to the area is supported by the fact that the Washo have a word for beaver, &quot;c&#x27;imhélhel&quot; and the northern Paiute of Walker Lake, Honey Lake and Pyramid Lake have a word for beaver &quot;su-i&#x27;-tu-ti-kut&#x27;-teh&quot;. When Stephen Powers visited the northern Paiute to collect Indian materials for the Smithsonian Institution in preparation for the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, he reported that the northern Paiute wrapped their hair in strips of beaver fur, made medicine from parts of beaver and that their creation legend included beaver. In addition, fur trapper Stephen Hall Meek &quot;set his traps on the Truckee River in 1833&quot;, which strongly suggests that he saw a beaver or beaver sign. Supporting this line of evidence, Tappe records in 1941 an eyewitness who said beaver were plentiful on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada on the upper part of the Carson River and its tributaries in Alpine County until 1892 when they fell victim to heavy trapping. James &quot;Grizzly&quot; Adams&#x27; also reports trapping beaver in the lower Carson River around 1860, &quot;In the evening we caught a fine lot of salmon-trout (Cutthroat trout), using grasshoppers for bait, and in the night killed half a dozen beavers, which were very tame.&quot; Recent novel physical evidence of beaver&#x27;s historic presence in the Sierra Nevada was the discovery of beaver dams dating to the 1850s in Red Clover Creek in the Feather River watershed. The presence of beaver dams has been shown to either increase the number of fish, their size, or both, in a study of brook, rainbow and brown trout in nearby Sagehen Creek, which flows into the Little Truckee River at an altitude of and is a stream typical of the eastern slope of the northern Sierra Nevada. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization but a recent study of ten Tahoe streams utilizing aerial multispectral videography, including Trout Creek and Cold Creek, has shown that deciduous, thick and thin herbaceous vegetation has increased near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. Benefits of beaver dams include removal of sediment and excessive pollutants travelling downstream, which improves water clarity, which was shown to worsen when beaver dams were recently removed in nearby Taylor Creek and Ward Creek. Flooding from beaver dams is relatively inexpensively controlled with flow devices.

==Recreation==

The river is heavily used for recreation, including whitewater rafting and fly fishing. A common rafting run is the River Ranch Run. Starting from the outlet gates at Lake Tahoe stretching about , the run ends at the River Ranch Restaurant. These rapids are almost all class 1 and class 2. In downtown Reno the river has been sculpted into a half-mile Class 2/3 whitewater park, and is used mainly for kayaking.

The Truckee River is western Nevada&#x27;s largest river. It supports a large sport fishing population each year. Kim Tisdale of the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW), is the state&#x27;s Western Regions Fishery Supervisor; she commented that NDOW&#x27;s goal is for a catch rate of one to two fish per hour in the Truckee. To accomplish this, NDOW stocks a total of 105,000 trout per year. 70,000 of those are native Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi&quot;) and the rest are non-native Rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;). The Truckee also boasts a healthy, self-sustaining non-native Brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) population.

==Hydrology and water quality==
Because of the endangered species present and because the Lake Tahoe Basin comprises the headwaters of the Truckee River, the river has been the focus of several water quality investigations, the most detailed starting in the mid-1980s. Under the direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a comprehensive dynamic hydrology transport model was developed by Earth Metrics Inc. The model&#x27;s name was subsequently changed to DSSAM, and it was applied to analyze land use, and wastewater management decisions throughout the Truckee River Basin of and to provide guidance in other U.S. river basins. Analytes addressed included nitrogen, reactive phosphate, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids and nine other parameters. Based on the use of the model, some decisions have been influenced to enhance riverine quality and aid the viability of associated biota. Impacts upon the receiving waters of Pyramid Lake were also analyzed. It is thought that dumping raw sewage into the Truckee River is a detriment to the water quality in several communities.

<text>The victoriatus was a silver coin issued during the Roman Republic from about 221 BC to 170 BC. The obverse of the coin featured the bust of Jupiter and the reverse featured Victory placing a wreath upon a trophy with the inscription &quot;ROMA&quot; in exergue. The name &quot;victoriatus&quot; is an ancient term, attested by several contemporary texts and inscriptions. The coin was known as a &quot;tropaikon&quot; (τροπαικον, due to the trophy on the reverse) among Greek speakers.

The coin originally weighed about 3.4 grams (3 scruples), meaning that it was half the value of the &quot;quadrigatus&quot;, a coin weighing 6 scruples that was by this time no longer produced. The &quot;victoriatus&quot; was made of a more debased silver than the &quot;denarius&quot;, which was introduced at about the same time. Hoard evidence indicates that the coin circulated in southern Italy and later Gaul, indicating that the coin was intended as a replacement for the drachma or half-nomos instead of as part of the normal Roman coin system. When first issued the &quot;victoriatus&quot; had a value of about 3/4 of a &quot;denarius&quot;, however when the &quot;quinarius&quot; was reintroduced in 101 BC with a similar type, it was valued at 1/2 a &quot;denarius&quot;. This indicates that &quot;victoriati&quot; that were still in circulation at this time were worn and considered to be worth only half a &quot;denarius&quot;. The reintroduced &quot;quinarius&quot; was produced mainly for Cisalpine Gaul, where the &quot;victoriatus&quot; and its imitations were popular. The reintroduced &quot;quinarius&quot; may have continued to be called a &quot;victoriatus&quot;, although there is no written evidence of this.

The &quot;victoriati&quot; abruptly cease to be deposited in Italian hoards in the mid-second century BC, probably indicating that they were officially withdrawn from circulation.

The term &quot;victoriatus&quot; can still be found today in the family name Vettorato in the province of Venice, or Greekized to Vittoratos / Vitoratos in Kefalonia.

<doc id="575367" wikidata="Q1930879" url="?curid=575367" title="Stormwatch (album)">
<text>Stormwatch is the twelfth studio album by progressive rock band Jethro Tull, released in September 1979. The album is often considered the last in a trio of folk rock albums released by the band at the end of the 1970s, alongside &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; (1977) and &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; (1978). The album&#x27;s themes deal mostly with the environment, climate and seaside living, and were heavily inspired by the Isle of Skye in Scotland, where frontman Ian Anderson had recently purchased property.

&quot;Stormwatch&quot; was notably the last Tull album to feature the &quot;classic&quot; line-up of the 1970s, as drummer Barrie &quot;Barriemore&quot; Barlow and keyboardists John Evan and Dee Palmer all left or were fired from the band in the months after the album&#x27;s tour concluded in April 1980; further, bassist John Glascock had died from heart complications in November 1979 during the tour. Glascock&#x27;s playing is largely absent on the album as a result of his medical issues, with Anderson playing bass on all but three tracks.

==Recording==
&quot;Stormwatch&quot; was recorded over a series of sessions lasting from August 1978 until July 1979, although the majority of the album&#x27;s tracks were recorded in the later 1979 sessions. The initial series of sessions in 1978 only produced one track which would appear on the album (&quot;Something&#x27;s On the Move&quot;) with guitarist Martin Barre mentioning in a 1979 interview that &quot;we completed an album&#x27;s worth of material, then we went away to America-- and when we got back, we listened to it again and it was not there at all. So, we decided to start again.&quot; In early 1979, the band recorded for the album while Ian Anderson, keyboardist/arranger David Palmer (now Dee Palmer) and Barre simultaneously wrote music for &quot;The Water&#x27;s Edge&quot;, a commissioned program for the Scottish Ballet. Some of the music written for &quot;The Water&#x27;s Edge&quot; would later develop into tracks on &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, such as &quot;Elegy&quot; and &quot;Dark Ages&quot;.

Most of the album was recorded at Anderson&#x27;s Maison Rogue Studios in Fulham, London, although some sessions took place at Morgan Studios, Townhouse Studios and the Maison Rogue Mobile studio at Anderson&#x27;s home due to recording time not always being available for the band at Maison Rogue. Like the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;, much of &quot;Stormwatch&quot; was recorded late at night, as daytime hours at Maison Rogue were usually left open for other bands. Thames Television meteorologist Francis Wilson performs a spoken word piece at the beginning of &quot;Dun Ringill&quot;.

Jethro Tull bassist John Glascock only plays on three of the album&#x27;s tracks (&quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; and &quot;Elegy&quot;), as a result of Anderson dismissing him from the recording sessions in May 1979 due to Glascock&#x27;s medical issues affecting his playing. Anderson described the dismissal of Glascock as being in the interest of his own health and nothing personal: &quot;Somebody had to be the tough guy and the nature of my hard message to him was, &quot;John, I really don&#x27;t think you can carry on working on this album, you&#x27;ve really got to go and get straightened out... I don&#x27;t want you to come in tomorrow, go away and get yourself well.&#x27;&quot; Anderson chose to play bass on the rest of the album as opposed to hiring a session musician, saying &quot;It was no big deal -- anybody can play the bass. It&#x27;s only four strings after all!&quot; Some of the album&#x27;s tracks were recorded with Anderson and drummer Barrie &quot;Barriemore&quot; Barlow recording a rhythm track together which the rest of the band would overdub their parts over. Several songs were recorded for the album but then cut from the final track listing, including songs which would later be released as B-sides or on future compilations, such as &quot;Crossword&quot;, &quot;Kelpie&quot; and &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot;.

The instrumental piece &quot;Elegy&quot; which closes the album was written entirely by Palmer, making it one of the few Jethro Tull songs written without the involvement of Anderson.

==Musical style and themes==
Much of the album&#x27;s themes and lyrical content were inspired and shaped by Anderson&#x27;s recently purchased estate in Kilmarie on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, as well as the salmon farming business which he was beginning to embark upon at the same location. The track &quot;Dun Ringill&quot; is named after the historic site of an Iron Age fort on the Isle, which served as the original seat of the Clan MacKinnon. The lyrics for &quot;Old Ghosts&quot; were inspired by the graveyard in Kilmarie, while &quot;Warm Sporran&quot; references the type of pouch traditionally worn with a kilt. Other tracks reference the constellation of Orion, the legend of the Flying Dutchman, the conjecture of global cooling common during the 1970s and what Anderson called his &quot;sceptical nature&quot; of oil drilling in the North Sea. The album&#x27;s tracks are linked by a loose theme of environmental concern, particularly regarding what Anderson described as &quot;Things about climate and weather, and seascapes... There&#x27;s a lot of stuff on it about wild, stormy weather, particularly in a marine context.&quot;

&quot;Elegy&quot; was written as an ode to Palmer&#x27;s father, with Palmer writing the song within an hour after first hearing that he had died. The song is musically based on the classical Latin sequence &quot;Dies irae&quot;.

<text>Squash tennis is an American variant of squash, one played with a ball and racquets that are more similar to the equipment used for lawn tennis, and with somewhat different rules. The game offers the complexity of squash and the speed of racquetball.

==Court==
Squash tennis is played in various four-walled courts. The front wall (against which the ball is served) features a telltale (usually clad in tin) at the bottom couple feet from the floor, a service line about from the floor, and an out-of-bounds line around from the floor. The back wall out line is from the floor. There are two required lines on the floor: a service line about from the back wall, and a center court line running at least from the front wall to the service line. Unlike a squash racquets court, there are no service boxes. There are four types of courts:

===North American squash court===
A North American squash court is . Originally designed for the related game of squash racquets, by the early 1930s the National Squash Tennis Association (NSTA) approved play on this kind of court. The dimensions are quite similar to the official squash tennis court. The only required modifications are the addition of a back wall line (in N. American squash the back wall line is from the floor) and the center court line on the floor. Temporary lines can easily be added with blue painter&#x27;s tape. The problem today is that as the North American version of squash becomes less popular, new courts are not being built, and many old ones are being converted to other uses.

===Squash tennis court===
In 1910 the NSTA adopted a standard court size of . Although many of these were built in the New York area, after play was authorized on a North American squash court they began to disappear. It did not make economic sense to maintain a specialty court when a more versatile one was acceptable.

===International squash court===
An International squash court is . The additional lines will need to be added. The extra width of the court makes the various multi-walled shots more difficult or impossible, so experienced players prefer to use a North American court. However, a court is often the only one generally available, particularly outside North America.

===Non-standard courts===
Originally the game was played on a racquets court, then on fives courts. Before 1911 there were no standards for court size, and ones constructed specifically for squash tennis varied from each other somewhat. They were constructed at private estates and clubs. At least one of these courts survives today in a playable condition. The court at Plum Orchard was fully restored in 2008 with the tins in place and working electric lights. It was added to George Lauder Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;Plum Orchard&quot; estate on Cumberland Island, Georgia, in the winter of 1903/04, and is now owned by the National Park Service. An exhibit on squash tennis history has recently been installed in the mansion, which is occasionally open for public tours.

==Equipment==
Required equipment is fairly simple and inexpensive: junior tennis racquets and standard lawn tennis ball. In decades past, modified tennis balls were manufactured for the game. They had higher pressure and were slightly smaller than tennis balls. The last specially manufactured ball was green, so that it could be more easily seen against white walls. Early courts had dark wood walls so that white tennis balls could be seen. Players now either use a marker to darken a yellow ball, or use colored tennis balls (such as the pink ball sold on a limited basis by Penn to raise money for breast cancer research). Blue painter&#x27;s tape can be used to add the additional lines on the floor and back wall of squash racquets courts.

==Manner of play==
Squash tennis is played by two players. An illustrated playing guide with rules was published by the NSTA in 1968 (see external links below).

===Serve===
At the beginning of the first game, a spin of the racquet is used to decide who serves first. In subsequent games of a match, the player who won the previous game serves first.

The server stands behind the floor service line, either to the left or right of the center line. Tossing the ball in the air, he strikes it with the racquet before the ball hits the ground. The service is good if the ball:
* first hits the front wall above the service line and below the out line (touching the lines is prohibited),
* without hitting the back wall, lands in front of the service line on the opposite side of the court, left or right (depending on the side the server).

This is the major difference between squash tennis and squash racquets. In the latter sport the ball must go beyond the floor service line into the receiver&#x27;s box. But it is similar to lawn tennis, as the ball is served diagonally and lands in front of the service line. In squash racquets the server also stands in toward the side wall, rather than in the center of the court.

At the beginning, the server can choose which side he starts, left or right. One fault is allowed if the ball does not go out (i.e. does not hit or go above the out lines, strikes the telltale, nor hits the floor before hitting the front wall). If the server wins the point he must then switch to the opposite side of the court (left or right) before serving again, alternating each serve.

The standard serve is a gently hit ball that strikes just below the front wall out line, comes back in a high arc, then bounces just in front of the floor service line where it meets the side wall. Slight cut will help the ball hug the wall. A high bounce along the wall is more difficult to return. The receiver cannot strike the ball before it bounces on the floor.

===Rally===

After a fair serve the receiver strikes the ball so that it either directly or indirectly hits the front wall before hitting the floor a second time, goes out of bounds, or strikes the tin. Players thus alternate hitting the ball until one fails to make a fair return. The ball can only be played off the back wall if the ball first hits the back wall. A ball may hit anywhere on the back wall if it first bounces off the floor—otherwise it must stay below the back wall out line. Unintentional interference results in a &quot;let&quot;—the point is replayed.

===Scoring===

A game is played until one player reaches 15 points, except if the score first reaches 13/13 or 14/14. When 13/13 is reached, the receiver decides if the game should go to 15, 16, or 18 points. If it reaches 14/14 (without having been 13/13) the receiver decides on either 15 or 17. One does not have to win by two points. Originally only the server could score; if he lost the rally he would lose the right to serve. Current rules give the point and the serve to the winner of a rally.

A match is best three out of five games.

==History==

The games of squash racquets and its parent sport, racquets, spread to America in the 1880s with the nation&#x27;s first courts built at St. Paul&#x27;s School, in Concord, New Hampshire. Due to a delay in shipping the proper racquets&#x27; equipment, the boys used balls and racquets for the game of lawn tennis that had also been recently introduced to the country. Even after the proper equipment arrived, some still continued to use tennis equipment on both kinds of courts.

In the 1890s both squash racquets and squash tennis had spread to adults in Boston, and play started to become more formalized. In 1898, after the construction of a court at the Tuxedo Club in Tuxedo Park, New York, squash tennis became popular among members of New York society. Private courts were built on estates owned by such millionaires as William C. Whitney, J. P. Morgan, and Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s nephew George Lauder Carnegie. By 1905, the Racquet and Tennis Club, Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia Clubs in Manhattan had courts, as did Brooklyn&#x27;s Crescent A. C. and the Heights Casino.

In 1911 the National Squash Tennis Association was founded and organized by the banker, John W. Prentiss, Harvard Club of New York. Rules, equipment, and court dimensions became formalized.

Briefly the sport gained popularity and some limited play in other cities such as Detroit, Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, but soon squash racquets overshadowed squash tennis. But in New York City the game maintained a strong following during the 1920s and 1930s. A decision to introduce a highly pressurized ball hastened the decline of the sport. A faster ball was preferred by advanced players, but it discouraged novices. In an effort to make the game more accessible, tournament play was authorized on squash racquets courts. But for many years the sport attracted few new players. During World War II the special ball was no longer manufactured, so advanced players started to lose interest.

Two outstanding champions of the fifties were Robert Reeve and Trudy Porter. League play and tournaments continued with energy supplied by Norman F. Torrance in the 1950s. The sixties saw a revival as younger players took up the game and Jim Prigoff became National Champion and later President of the Squash Tennis Association and Richard C. &quot;Dick&quot; Squires became active when a special ball was once again available to players. Prigoff dominated the Nationals in the 1960s beating both Squires and Bacallao until he retired from the game in 1969. But competition by the new game of racquetball prevented these later attempts from making any headway with the public. The annual nationals became the only formal tournament, but became the virtual private property of two men, Pedro A. Bacallao (1969–1980, 1986) and Gary Squires (1982–1983, 1985, 1987–2000) son of Dick Squires.

==Squash tennis status==

The game is virtually extinct. There are no organized tournaments. The game is played on a regular basis only by about a dozen players at the Harvard Club in New York City; although longtime enthusiast Bill Rubin stated that there are a few young, very talented, new players. The NSTA has not held a meeting in several years.

The basic equipment is inexpensive, however, and for those with access to a squash court it can easily be enjoyed for its recreational and exercise value. Dick Squires published a guide to the sport in 1968. The booklet was not copyrighted, and is available online at Project Gutenberg. The guide includes pointers on how to play the game, history, rules, and a list of all national champions.

<text>CP24 is a Canadian English-language specialty news channel owned by Bell Media, a subsidiary of BCE Inc. and operated alongside the Bell-owned CTV Television Network&#x27;s owned-and-operated television stations CFTO-DT (CTV Toronto) and CKVR-DT (CTV 2 Barrie). The channel broadcasts from 9 Channel Nine Court in the Toronto borough of Scarborough.

It was first originally launched on March 30, 1998, under the name CablePulse24 by its owners CHUM Limited and Sun Media. The channel was named as an extension of CITY-TV (Citytv Toronto)&#x27;s newscasts, which were then known as &quot;CityPulse&quot;. CHUM acquired Sun Media&#x27;s interest in 2004 after acquiring the assets of Craig Media. In 2006, Bell Globemedia acquired CP24 and its parent CHUM Limited, but regulatory limits in media ownership forced CHUM to sell off the Citytv stations to avoid conflicts with CTV stations in the same markets. CTVglobemedia retained the ownership of CP24 and the small market A-Channel stations, but subsequently sold the Citytv stations including CITY-TV, to Rogers Media in mid-2007, which held a 20% stake until 2008.

The channel focuses on local news from the Greater Toronto Area and Southern Ontario, while also covering national and international news. It is distributed through cable in Southern Ontario and direct broadcast satellite nationally.

As of 2023, CP24 streams free worldwide on its website with no subscription required.

==History==
===Under CHUM===
The channel was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1996 as Pulse 24, described as &quot;a 24-hour-a-day specialty television service devoted to news and information, with a focus on southern Ontario local and regional news and information&quot;, and launched on March 30, 1998, as &quot;CablePulse 24&quot;, under the ownership of CHUM Limited, the parent company of CITY-TV and minority partner Sun Media, owner of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; daily newspaper with most programming broadcast out of 299 Queen Street West. For the first 10 years after its inception, CP24&#x27;s programming was anchored and featured reports from Citytv personalities, live &quot;CityPulse&quot; news broadcasts were immediately repeated on CP24 after their initial broadcast on CITY-TV (except for breaking news coverage), and special coverage was simulcast between the channel and the television station. Select programming from other CHUM stations would also be featured on the channel, including &quot;The NewMusic&quot; and &quot;Fashion Television&quot;; another program, &quot;24Ontario&quot;, featured news stories from CHUM&#x27;s NewNet stations elsewhere in the province.

Overnight broadcasts on CP24 featured vintage &quot;CityPulse&quot; news broadcasts from CITY-TV during the 1970s &amp; 1980s branded as &quot;Rewind&quot;. The rebroadcasts were accompanied by a graphic on the top right corner of the screen that read &quot;Rewind&quot;, supplemented with the original airdate below it.

On December 1, 2004, CHUM Limited acquired the remaining interest in CP24 (giving it 100% of its shares), when the &quot;Sun&#x27;s&quot; owners sold their 29.9% share in CP24 after acquiring its independent broadcast station CKXT-TV, the same day that CHUM Limited took control of Craig Media and its assets also.

Under CHUM ownership, Mark Dailey of CITY provided continuity voice announcements on CP24.

===Under CTV===


On July 12, 2006, Bell Globemedia (the latter which became CTVglobemedia in 2007) announced a friendly bid to take over CHUM Limited for an estimated $1.7 billion. One year later on June 8, 2007, the CRTC approved the CTV takeover of CHUM. However, the CRTC made the deal conditional on CTV selling the Citytv stations. On June 12, 2007, Rogers announced that it had agreed to buy the Citytv stations (including Citytv Toronto) for $375 million. The deal was finalized later that year, with a stipulation that CTV maintain ownership of CHUM&#x27;s 299 Queen Street West headquarters and studios. CTV chose to keep CP24, and the rest of CHUM assets (including the A-Channel stations) it had said it would sell.

As a result of the ownership changes, CP24 began to separate its operations from those of CITY-TV. This process began in 2008, with the introduction of new CP24-only personalities (which meant they were no longer seen anchoring/reporting on the CityNews side), new live eye trucks (also known as Breaking News Vehicles) which were outfitted with white and black design bearing the CP24 and red &quot;Breaking News&quot; decals, the establishment of a new studio and newsroom on the second floor of the 299 Queen Street West building in November of that year, and the removal of nearly all Citytv&#x27;s news simulcasts from its schedule few weeks later on December 10 of that year, (excluding &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;), and replacing the 6 p.m. &quot;CityNews&quot; simulcast with CFTO&#x27;s &quot;CTV News Toronto at Six&quot;.

On March 26, 2009, &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; was replaced with the launch of its own new morning show, &quot;CP24 Breakfast&quot;, which marked the completion of CP24&#x27;s separation from Citytv. Also coinciding with the launch, included the rebranding of its oldies music radio station 1050 CHUM (another station which was acquired in the CTV/CHUM acquisition) to a news talk radio format which operated as an audio simulcast of CP24 called &quot;CP24 Radio 1050&quot;. The move was intended to broaden the network&#x27;s reach as a multi-platform news source, but did not prove successful; &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; columnist Ted Woloshyn in particular pointed out that the station was simply airing a straight simulcast of CP24 television content that was not properly formatted for radio.

Following the layoffs and cost-cutting measures that took place at the Citytv stations across Canada (including the cancellation of Citytv Toronto&#x27;s &quot;CityNews at Five&quot; announced on January 19, 2010), CP24 immediately expanded its &quot;Live at 5&quot; newscast (which had been airing for 15 minutes since its launch in 2008) to 30 minutes along with the launch of another half-hour newscast, &quot;Live at 5:30&quot;. As a result, CP24&#x27;s late-afternoon talk shows, such as &quot;Animal House Calls&quot; and &quot;Hot Property&quot;, which had been seen weekdays at 5:15 p.m. were moved to a new 7:15 p.m. time slot on January 26, 2010.

===Under Bell===

On September 10, 2010, BCE (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of $3.2 billion CAD. The deal which required CRTC approval, was approved on March 7, 2011 and closed on April 1 of that year, on which CTVglobemedia was rebranded Bell Media.

On March 19, 2011, CP24 introduced a weekend edition of &quot;CP24 Breakfast&quot;, hosted by Pooja Handa and Gurdeep Ahluwalia, George Lagogianes is the remote host and Nneka Elliott (who resigned on May 2, 2011, and was replaced by Jamie Gutfreund) delivers the weather forecasts. The show runs from 7:00 to 10:15 a.m.

On June 20, 2024, Bell announced that CP24 would move studios from 299 Queen Street West, where it was based since its inception, to Bell Media&#x27;s 9 Channel Nine Court building in Scarborough (which houses the operations of CFTO and several other Bell Media specialty networks) later in the year. The network broadcast for the first time from the Agincourt complex on November 26, 2024; 299 Queen Street West will continue to serve as a downtown bureau for CFTO and CP24.

==Location and format==
As of November 26, 2024, CP24 is based out of 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough at Highway 401 and McCowan Road which is also home to several other Bell-owned television stations such as CTV Toronto, USA Network and TSN.

Previously, CP24 was based at 299 Queen Street West, at the corner of John Street and Queen Street West which at one point shared the newsroom with CITY-TV on the ground floor (which are now the facilities of Bell Media&#x27;s 24-hour business news channel, BNN Bloomberg) when both CITY-TV and CP24 were co-owned by CHUM Limited. As with CITY-TV, CP24 had no news desk for the most part while anchors read the news standing up.

In November 2008, CP24 moved its operations to a new studio and newsroom on the second floor of the complex. Coinciding with the new studio, CP24 also adopted an updated on-air appearance, replacing the previous blue and gold colour scheme with a red, white and black design.

CP24&#x27;s screen format uses a window in the top-left of the screen to show the current program, which is surrounded with a sidebar with weather and traffic reports, scrolling news headlines and local entertainment/event information, and tickers for stocks and sports. This format has been described as more closely resembling a website than a conventional television channel, and has been replicated with a similar look of CP24&#x27;s enriched screen on its website. This format was referred to as &quot;NewStyle NewsFlow&quot; during the CHUM era.

On September 27, 2012, CP24 again updated its on-air appearance as the channel began broadcasting in high definition. The relaunched enriched screen includes several changes, such as:

* the entertainment and concert listings were reallocated from the bottom screen to the right-hand corner between the weather and traffic boxes,
* the weather scroll was expanded to a &quot;five-day&quot; contrast (which previously only displayed in &quot;four-day&quot; contrast) on which the scroll displays the forecast breakdown for the next 24-hours (e.g., &quot;MORN&quot; for both the current morning and the next morning, &quot;AFT&quot;, for afternoon, &quot;EVE&quot; for evening and &quot;NITE&quot; for overnight), and
* a larger sports headline news scroll was added at the bottom, in which business news from Canada&#x27;s Toronto Stock Exchange and the American New York Stock Exchange takes over the sports headline scroll Monday-Friday.

From its inception prior to its acquisition by CTV, CP24 was closely integrated with CITY-DT&#x27;s newsroom, which had shared programming, anchors and hosts at the time. CP24, is now available on iHeartRadio Canada effective December 2017.

==Carriage and popularity==
CP24 is seen on cable channel 24 on most cable providers that carry the channel. It is not carried on any analogue cable system outside of Central or Southern Ontario, although it is available on direct broadcast satellite and IPTV television providers in some markets. The channel is available across Canada on Bell Satellite TV, on which the station is part of the service&#x27;s &quot;News&quot; package. It is also available in the &quot;FYI&quot; package provided to Shaw Direct customers.

Because of its diverse, localized and partially text-based content, the channel is among the most popular choices in the Greater Toronto Area and much of Southern Ontario (outside of Ottawa) for screening in public places such as waiting areas, train stations, restaurants, and lounges.

==Remote camera use==
In addition to the Freeway Management System – COMPASS and RESCU cameras, CP24 operates EYES cameras located at:
* CN Tower
* Highway 401
* Toronto Pearson International Airport
* Rogers Centre
* Toronto City Hall
* Don Valley Parkway
* 299 Queen Street West

===Chopper 24===
Since 2008, CP24 has leased a Bell 206L-4 Long Ranger (C-FCTV) news helicopter which can broadcast live at 1500 feet above land; nicknamed &quot;Chopper 24&quot;, which is supplied by its sister station, CTV Toronto and is painted with CTV&#x27;s colouring and logo.

===Remote truck use===
CP24 operates a fleet of remote transmission trucks that use digital microwave and satellite uplink systems to do live news reports throughout the region. Known as &quot;Breaking News Vehicles&quot; the custom-built 2008 Chevrolet Suburbans were outfitted by Frontline Communications of Clearwater, Florida, USA. The vehicles use a red, white and black paint scheme with the channel&#x27;s logo and the &quot;Breaking News!&quot; slogan also included in the design.

===Beat the Traffic===
In 2009, CP24 became the first station in Canada to introduce a new Beat the Traffic system showing a three-dimensional animated map displaying traffic flow, roadwork, accidents and current highway travel times.

==CP24 HD==
The CRTC approved an application by then-owners CHUM Limited in June 2007 to launch a high-definition simulcast of CP24. On September 27, 2012, CP24 began broadcasting in HD (with the SD feed letterboxed) initially on Bell Fibe TV coinciding with it, a new enhanced on-air appearance. The HD feed was also added on the Bell Satellite TV service in December 2012. On June 25, 2013, CP24 began broadcasting in HD on Rogers Cable, shortly after the competing Rogers Media-owned CityNews Channel, which had been available in HD on Rogers Cable since launch, announced it would be shutting down. On March 1, 2017, Shaw Direct added the HD version to its lineup, it was only available in SD until then on that provider. Bell MTS has not yet launched the feed in HD.

==CP24 GO==
In December 2013, CP24 (along with several other Bell Media television channels) launched a TV Everywhere service known as &quot;CP24 GO&quot;, which is offered for free to Bell TV customers. It can be accessed from a computer or on a mobile app such as a tablet or smartphone. However, CP24 continues to offer its occasional free live streaming of some major news events on its website.

<text>CTV 2 Atlantic is a Canadian cable television channel serving Atlantic Canada owned by Bell Media, with its studios located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Owned by the Bell Media subsidiary of BCE Inc., it operates as a &quot;de facto&quot; owned-and-operated station of its secondary CTV 2 television system.

The channel launched as the Atlantic Satellite Network (or ASN) in 1983. It is designated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) as a &quot;satellite-to-cable television programming undertaking,&quot; defined as a local television channel available in the region on basic cable television, and now throughout Canada on many digital cable systems and satellite television, but without any terrestrial transmitters (a small number of other channels, mainly educational broadcasters, are similarly designated). The channel does not appear to have mandatory cable carriage rights, although nearly all cable systems in the region offer it. Nonetheless, it has full simultaneous substitution rights in the Atlantic provinces, whereas most non-broadcast channels do not.

Prior to fall 2008, the channel had received much of its programming from CHUM Limited&#x27;s Citytv (now owned by Rogers Media) and A-Channel (now CTV 2) systems, which did not operate in the region; beginning in the early 2000s, timeshifted CTV programs often aired on the channel as well. CTV acquired CHUM (excluding Citytv) in 2007, and ASN merged with the relaunched A system on August 11, 2008.

On cable in the Halifax area, CTV Two Atlantic can be found on EastLink TV channel 7, and Bell Aliant Fibe TV channel 5. There is also an HD feed on EastLink TV channel 606 and on Bell Aliant Fibe channel 406. Outside Halifax, the station can usually be found on either channel 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 13.

==History==

The channel launched as the Atlantic Satellite Network on May 29, 1983, under the ownership of CHUM Limited, as a supplementary service to its ATV system of CTV affiliates (now known as CTV Atlantic). ASN initially aired &quot;Atlantic Pulse&quot; newscasts at alternate times to ATV&#x27;s newscasts. &quot;Atlantic Pulse&quot; used ATV reporters, but different anchors and graphics, with a comparatively spartan set located across the newsroom from ATV&#x27;s. ASN also carried alternative entertainment programming, much of it produced by or otherwise sourced from CHUM&#x27;s Toronto station CITY-TV (including a nightly feature film, branded under the title &quot;Great Movies&quot;, as CITY-TV did). 

In 1997, as part of a multi-station trade between CHUM and Baton Broadcasting, ATV and ASN became Baton properties; ATV was integrated into the expanded CTV network, while ASN took over the few remaining CHUM programs from ATV. ASN remained, for all intents and purposes, the Citytv affiliate in Atlantic Canada, and for about another decade carried a similar mix of movies and series in primetime. However, by the mid-2000s, the amount of CHUM programming on the ASN schedule had in fact decreased, and CHUM-supplied soap operas and movies (aside from a handful of weekend timeslots) were no longer present.
Following the merger between CHUM and CTVglobemedia, it appeared likely that ASN would become the Citytv owned-and-operated station for Atlantic Canada. However, the merger was made conditional on the sale of Citytv to a third party, with Rogers Communications being the buyer of the television system; as such, ASN was relaunched as part of the CTV&#x27;s also recently acquired A system on August 11, 2008, and became known as A Atlantic. On May 30, 2011, Bell Media announced that A Atlantic, along with the rest of the A system would be rebranded as CTV Two, thus becoming known as CTV Two Atlantic. The official relaunch to CTV Two took place on August 29, 2011. CTV Two Atlantic launched a high definition feed called CTV Two Atlantic HD on September 12, 2011 (June 4, 2019 to replace the SD feed on Shaw Direct).

==Programming==

ASN also devoted a significant amount of its daytime schedule to educational programming provided by provincial education departments and by local universities. This university-supplied programming came from the Distance University Education via Television (DUET) service offered by ASN, in partnership with participating universities in Atlantic Canada to university students. Some of the university programs offered through DUET included business administration and gerontology. ASN provided 16 hours of educational programming each weekend from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and ten hours every Monday to Friday morning from 4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. (in the early years, some TVOntario programs were carried on ASN, such as &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot; and &quot;Fast Forward&quot;). In September 1992, ASN launched a local version of Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, moving educational programs to the weekend and to overnight hours. By 1996, as specialty television began to grow in popularity, &quot;Atlantic Pulse&quot; gave way to a short-lived scaled-back version called &quot;ATV Headline News&quot;. &quot;ATV Headline News&quot; only lasted until early 1998, when ASN&#x27;s news programming was fully integrated into the ATV (now CTV Atlantic) news operation.
While ATV aired some syndicated programming from the United States that was shown on CITY-TV in Toronto (such as &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; repeats), ASN aired programs associated with CTV in the rest of the country, such as &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Camilla Scott&quot;. ASN was also the original home of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; until it moved to ATV in 1991 and 11 years later on NTV in 2002 from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Both &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; are currently broadcast by Hamilton, Ontario-based CHCH-DT as of September 2012.

Over the years, ASN/A Atlantic has occasionally aired selected CTV network programming. In some cases, this would be live programming that had been scheduled for times that were inconvenient for either or both of ATV and NTV, such as weekend afternoon sports programming that might interfere with local news. From fall 2005 to fall 2008, ASN had also carried samenight rebroadcasts of CTV programs on most nights at 11:00 p.m. AT (10:00 p.m. ET). This appeared to be to maximize the network&#x27;s simultaneous substitution coverage; since 1997, CTV Atlantic had aired series from the final hour of U.S. primetime earlier in the evening in order to accommodate newscasts at 11:00 p.m. AT.

Since NTV&#x27;s 2002 slow disaffiliation from CTV, ASN/A Atlantic has also shown selected high-profile CTV network programs that are likely to be of interest to viewers in Newfoundland and Labrador, but would not otherwise be widely available in that province due to the lack of an alternate CTV affiliate on basic cable. This has included the first three seasons of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, which NTV began to carry in 2006, as well as sports programming such as CTV&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. In these cases, the programs would continue to air on CTV Atlantic as well. Such occurrences are currently rare since most CTV programs are available on analog cable in Newfoundland on other channels, either through simulcasts on U.S. network affiliates, or through repeats on CTV&#x27;s analog specialty channels like The Comedy Network.

Despite the then-pending CTVglobemedia/CHUM merger, CHUM content was actually lowered during the 2006–07 season compared to previous years, with other series from the CTV libraryincluding repeats, &quot;shelf&quot; series like &quot;What About Brian&quot;, programming from MTV Canada, and timeshifted CTV programming for simsub purposesmaking up the balance.

==News operation==
CTV 2 Atlantic presently broadcasts 15 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with three hours each weekday). The joint ownership of ATV and ASN was approved in 1983 without any restrictions on duplicated programming or news coverage between the two channels. This has been grandfathered into the CRTC&#x27;s current policy, which has required most newer large-market &quot;twinsticks&quot; to maintain separate programming and news content on both component stations.

Since 1997, ASN&#x27;s local programming has been cut back significantly. At its peak, &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; aired for two and a half hours daily; it now airs for two hours, broadcasting from 7 to 9 a.m. The format of the channel&#x27;s signature morning show &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; and its logo somewhat resembled the format and branding used by the Citytv stations. Also, while ASN still carried a noon newscast and an early-morning rebroadcast of CTV&#x27;s &quot;Live at 5&quot;, both are branded as &quot;CTV News&quot; programs. In mid-October 2005, ASN stopped carrying a late newscast, due to the additional CTV programming noted below.

Currently, CTV 2 Atlantic carries a late local newscast (a rebroadcast of CTV Atlantic&#x27;s late news at midnight), previously the rebroadcast was taken off the schedule in 2005 but has been brought back; as well as the aforementioned &quot;CTV News at Noon&quot;. CTV Two Atlantic&#x27;s morning program also retained the name &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; instead of &quot;A Morning&quot; during the A era. The show subsequently dropped the name, when the station was rebranded as CTV Two and the morning show became known as &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;.

===Notable current on-air staff===
* Todd Battis - news anchor, weekday evenings &quot;CTV News at Six&quot;

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Jill Krop - reporter for &quot;Atlantic Pulse&quot;/co-host of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; (now at CHAN-TV in Vancouver)
* Allan Rowe - Weekend Anchor/reporter for &quot;Atlantic Pulse&quot; (later at CIHF-TV, now MLA for Dartmouth South); now deceased.
* Jay Michaels (MacNeil) - co-host of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; (now at CKFM-FM in Toronto)
* Heather Hiscox - co-host of &quot;Lunch Television&quot; 1992-1997 (now at CBC News Network)
*Steve Murphy - news anchor, weekday evenings &quot;CTV News at Six&quot; (Still provides commentary pieces.)

==Advertising==
Until fall 2006, the CRTC required that &quot;commercial messages that are likely to have a negative impact on (NTV) be deleted from the ASN service distributed in St. John&#x27;s and Mount Pearl (and area)&quot; by Rogers Cable and its pre-2000 predecessor, Cable Atlantic. For several years, Rogers or Cable Atlantic aired scrolling text from Broadcast News in its place, and was faulted on several occasions for untimely malfunctions of the automated equipment that performed the deletion (i.e., entire segments of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; being blocked). In spring 2006, Rogers applied to have this condition removed, citing these complaints among other reasons. This was approved in fall 2006.

Since the channel&#x27;s inception, ASN/CTV Two Atlantic has not been permitted to solicit local advertising in the Halifax area, due to (in the CRTC&#x27;s opinion) insufficient support for local advertising. As part of the approval for Rogers&#x27;s request to remove the commercial blackouts in St. John&#x27;s, the channel also agreed not to solicit local advertising in that area either. CTV Two Atlantic is permitted to solicit local advertising in the rest of Atlantic Canada, as well as regional and national advertising; moreover the ban on &quot;solicitation&quot; does not necessarily prevent the channel from &quot;accepting&quot; local ad sales from the aforementioned areas.

<text>Hand-kissing is a greeting gesture that indicates courtesy, politeness, respect, admiration, affection or even devotion by one person toward another. A hand-kiss is considered a respectful way for a gentleman to greet a lady. Today, non-ritual hand-kissing is rare and takes place mostly within conservative class or diplomatic contexts. Today, the hand kiss has largely been replaced by a kiss on the cheek or a handshake.

A non-ritual hand-kiss can be initiated by the lady, who would hold out her right hand with the back of the hand facing upward; or by the gentleman extending his right hand with the palm facing upward to invite the lady to put her right hand lightly on it facing downward. The gentleman may bow towards the offered hand and (often symbolically) would touch her knuckles with his lips, while lightly holding the offered hand. However, the lips do not actually touch the hand in modern tradition, especially in a formal environment where any intimate or romantic undertones could be considered inappropriate. The gesture is short, lasting less than a second.

==Around the world==
In Arab World, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei, hand-kissing is a common way to greet elder people of all genders, primarily the closest relatives (both parents, grandparents, and uncles or aunts) and teachers. Occasionally, after kissing the hand, the greeter will draw the hand to his own forehead. In the Philippines, the gesture evolved into just touching the hand to the forehead; hand-kissing itself has become a separate kind of gesture that has merged with the European custom concerning when it may be used.

In Southern Italy, especially Sicily, the verbal greeting &quot;I kiss the hands.&quot; () derives from this usage. Similarly, in Hungary the verbal greeting &quot;I kiss your hand.&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Kezét csókolom.&quot;) is sometimes used, especially when greeting elders and in rural communities. The shortened version &quot;I kiss it.&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Csókolom.&quot;) is more wide spread. A similar expression exists also in Poland (Polish: &quot;Całuję rączki&quot;, meaning &quot;I kiss [your] little hands&quot;), although nowadays it&#x27;s considered obsolete.

In Romania the gesture is reserved for priests and women and it is common greeting when first introduced to a woman in parts of the country. The verbal expression towards women is &quot;I kiss your hand&quot; (Romanian: &quot;sarut mana&quot; and sometimes shortened to &quot;saru-mana&quot;) Towards priests it is sometimes changed into &quot;i kiss your right&quot; due to the belief that the right hand of the priest is holy and blessed regardless of the priest himself and any eventual shortcomings. In the past both parents used to get their hand kissed and seen as a type of blessing, however the expression is now almost exclusively towards women.

==Chivalrous gesture==

A hand-kiss was considered a respectful way for a gentleman to greet a lady. The practice originated in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Spanish courts of the 17th and 18th centuries. The gesture is still at times observed in Central Europe, namely in Poland, Austria and Hungary, among others.

Traditionally, the hand-kiss was initiated by a woman, who offered her hand to a man to kiss. The lady offering her hand was expected to be of the same or higher social status than the man. It was a gesture of courtesy and extreme politeness, and it was considered impolite and even rude to refuse an offered hand. Today, the practice is very uncommon in many European countries, and has been largely replaced by a kiss on the cheek or a handshake.

==Kissing the ring==

Kissing the hand, or particularly a ring on the hand was also a gesture of formal submission or pledge of allegiance of man to man, or as a diplomatic gesture. The gesture would indicate submission by kissing the signet ring (a form of seal worn as a jewelry ring), the person&#x27;s symbol of authority. The gesture was common in the European upper class throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. It started to disappear in the 20th century, to be replaced by the egalitarian handshake. However, former French president Jacques Chirac made hand-kissing his trademark and the gesture is still encountered in diplomatic situations.

==Religious usage==

In the Catholic Church, a Catholic meeting the Pope or a Cardinal, or even a lower-ranking prelate, will kiss the ring on his hand. This has become uncommon in circles not used to formal protocol, even often dispensed with amongst clergy. Sometimes, the devout Catholic combines the hand kissing with kneeling on the left knee as an even stronger expression of filial respect for the clerically high-ranking father. The cleric may then in a fatherly way lay his other hand on the kisser&#x27;s head or even bless him/her by a manual cross sign. In the Catholic Church, it is also traditional for the laity to kiss the hands of a newly-ordained priest after his inaugural mass, in veneration of the Body of Christ, which is held in the priest&#x27;s hands during the Holy Eucharist. In May 2014, Pope Francis kissed the hands of six Holocaust survivors to honour the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodox Churches, it is appropriate and common for laity to greet clergy, whether priests or bishops, by making a profound bow and saying, &quot;Father, bless&quot; (to a priest) or &quot;Master, bless&quot; (to a bishop) while placing their right hand, palm up, in front of their bodies. The priest then blesses them with the sign of the cross and then places his hand in theirs, offering the opportunity to kiss his hand. Orthodox Christians kiss their priest&#x27;s hands not only to honor their spiritual father confessor, but in veneration of the Body of Christ which the priest handles during the Divine Liturgy as he prepares Holy Communion. It is also a common practice when writing a letter to a priest to begin with the words &quot;Father Bless&quot; rather than &quot;Dear Father&quot; and end the letter with the words &quot;Kissing your right hand&quot; rather than &quot;Sincerely.&quot;

During liturgical services, altar servers and lower clergy will kiss the hand of a priest when handing him something in the course of their duties, such as a censer, when he receives it in his right hand, and a bishop when he receives it in either hand since a bishop bestows blessings with both hands.

There are records of hand-kissing in the Islamic Caliphate as early as the 7th century. Hand-kissing known as Taqbil, as a respect for nobility, is practiced by the Hadharem of Yemen.

==In popular culture==
The hand-kiss is used quite prominently in &quot;The Godfather&quot; series, as a way to indicate the person who is the Don. It also features in period films, such as &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;.

<text>CTV News Channel is a Canadian specialty news channel owned by Bell Media (a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada). It broadcasts national and international news headlines, breaking news, and information. The channel is headquartered at 9 Channel Nine Court in the Agincourt neighbourhood of Scarborough in Toronto, Ontario.

==History==

In September 1996, CTV Television Network Ltd. (a division of CTV) was granted a broadcast licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for CTV N1, a national English language specialty television service that would broadcast &quot;news, weather and sports reports, as well as business, consumer and lifestyle information&quot;, in a &#x27;headline news&#x27; format on a 15-minute news wheel.

The channel was launched on October 17, 1997 as CTV News 1. Under the terms of this licence, the channel broadcast news and information on a 15-minute wheel, beginning a new cycle every 15 minutes using a pre-recorded, server-hosted configuration. Not long after its launch, however, it began covering more breaking news. CTV News 1 used news segments from CTV National News and local CTV and BBS affiliates.

The channel began with its news anchors sitting at a desk which would periodically, while the anchor was not speaking, spin in a circle to change the background in front of which the anchor sat. This gimmick was criticized, and soon abandoned. The channel included a large on-screen news ticker that provided news updates, weather, sports scores, stock trading data, among other information. For many years, the network has aired the CTV National News at 10 pm Eastern – or 11 pm Atlantic, when the newscast begins its nightly run across the network (it airs at 11 pm local time over the air, or 11:30 pm in Newfoundland and southeastern Labrador). It is repeated every hour until 2 am Eastern, or 11 pm Pacific.

At launch, this channel was carried to cable companies. The network added a sports news format for sports updates like Sky Sports News.
On September 8, 1999, the channel was renamed CTV Newsnet, after the launch of then-sister channel, CTV Sportsnet.

CTV sought amendments to the channel&#x27;s condition of licence that had restricted it to a 15-minute news wheel, in order to allow greater coverage of breaking news, longer-form news-oriented discussion and other programming. These requests were met with mixed decisions from the CRTC. On April 7, 2005, the CRTC removed the condition mandating a 15-minute news cycle, substituting new but much more liberal conditions including the allowance of a small percentage of airtime devoted to long-form discussion programming.

On August 22, 2005, CTV Newsnet unveiled a new, full screen format with a considerably smaller news ticker broadcasting only news headlines, and revamped its late afternoon and primetime programming, with increases to its anchor, reporting and production teams, and a greater emphasis on general news from the main anchor desk, eliminating sports and business coverage. The network hoped to capitalize in part on the lockout which had nearly eliminated news programming on CBC Television (outside Quebec) and CBC Newsworld.

Before the 2005 format change, sports segments were co-branded with TSN, and business news with Report on Business Television (now BNN Bloomberg). These channels are owned by the same companies as CTV and Newsnet. Earlier in the network&#x27;s history, weather reports were provided by The Weather Network, which is independently owned, and sports segments were once co-branded with Headline Sports, and then later by CTV Sportsnet, which CTV owned before it acquired TSN.
CTV Newsnet was renamed CTV News Channel on May 26, 2009, though at the time no channel format or schedule change occurred. On September 10, 2010, Bell Canada (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of $3.2 billion CAD. The deal, which acquired CRTC approval, was approved on March 7, 2011 and closed on April of that year, CTVglobemedia was renamed Bell Media on April 1, 2011.

On October 3, 2011, CTV News Channel unveiled a new weekday programming lineup, which added three new news segments to the schedule (&quot;Direct&quot;, &quot;Express&quot; and &quot;National Affairs&quot;) and introduced four new news anchors.
On December 19, 2011, CTV News Channel underwent a major overhaul which consisted of a new logo, a new on-air presentation designed by Troika Design Group, and a newly renovated studio set as the channel began production in high definition for the first time. An HD feed was launched on the channel&#x27;s co-owned Bell Fibe TV service in February 2012. The set still consists of the traditional CTV newsroom background.

On July 5, 2017, CTV News Channel relaunched with a new look and automation package utilizing Super Ticker and Brando provided by Bannister Lake Software, a software application company located in Cambridge, Ontario.

<text>Hydrophylloideae is a subfamily of the plant family Boraginaceae. Its taxonomic position is somewhat uncertain. Traditionally, and under the Cronquist system, the taxon was given family rank under the name Hydrophyllaceae, and treated as part of the order Solanales. More recent systems have recognised a close relationship to the borage family, Boraginaceae, initially by placing Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginaceae together in an order Boraginales, and in the 2016 APG IV system by including Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginaceae. However, the placement and circumscription of Boraginaceae is still uncertain. Some sources now split off Hydrophyllaceae again (together with Namaceae).

Plants in this subfamily may be annual or perennial herbs or shrubs, with either a prostrate or an erect stem. Most have a taproot. The flowers are bisexual, and normally radial, with 5 petals and 5 stamens. About 20 genera, containing around 300 species, are recognised; many of them are native to the western United States.

The subfamily takes its name from the genus &quot;Hydrophyllum&quot; (waterleaf). Members include &quot;Emmenanthe&quot; (whispering bells), &quot;Nemophila&quot; (baby blue eyes) and &quot;Phacelia&quot; (scorpionweed).

==Genera==
, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website accepted the family Hydrophyllaceae rather than the subfamily Hydrophylloideae, and included 12 genera:
* &quot;Draperia&quot; 
* &quot;Ellisia&quot; 
* &quot;Emmenanthe&quot; 
* &quot;Eucrypta&quot; 
* &quot;Hesperochiron&quot; 
* &quot;Howellanthus&quot; 
* &quot;Hydrophyllum&quot; 
* &quot;Nemophila&quot; 
* &quot;Phacelia&quot; 
* &quot;Pholistoma&quot; 
* &quot;Romanzoffia&quot; 
* &quot;Tricardia&quot; 
Four further genera were accepted by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, but placed in the family Namaceae:
*&quot;Eriodictyon&quot; 
*&quot;Nama&quot; 
*&quot;Turricula&quot; 
*&quot;Wigandia&quot; 
The division into two families rather than one subfamily follows the recommendations of the Boraginales Working Group.

<text>DejaView is a Canadian English language specialty television channel owned by Corus Entertainment. It primarily airs television shows from the 1970s to 2010s. The channel’s name is a play on the phrase Deja Vu.

==History==
In November 2000, Global Television Network Inc. (then owned by Canwest) was granted approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service called &quot;Pop TV&quot;, described as &quot;featuring classic programs from the beginnings of television. Programming will explore vintage television and the cultural impact of television on our society by providing a window on television history.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 4, 2001 as DejaView.

After DejaView&#x27;s parent company, Canwest, filed for creditor protection in October 2009, Shaw Communications subsequently completed a purchase and took over the assets of Canwest&#x27;s broadcasting arm on October 27, 2010, which was announced in February of that year, and renamed the company Shaw Media.

On April 1, 2016, DejaView&#x27;s parent company, Shaw Media, was acquired by Corus Entertainment. It once became a sister station to CMT and W Network (though this lapsed in later years because the former is now airing what DejaView has played in the past), as with its other sister stations such as MovieTime.

In late 2016, a 1080i high definition simulcast of the standard definition feed was launched.

== Programming ==

Throughout the channel&#x27;s existence, it has primarily aired sitcoms and television dramas from the United States and Canada, however, other genres of programs have aired including game shows, reality television, and lifestyle series.

<doc id="575417" wikidata="Q2178805" url="?curid=575417" title="Réseau des sports">
<text>Réseau des sports (RDS) is a Canadian French language discretionary specialty channel oriented towards sports and sport-related shows. It is available in 2.5 million homes, and is owned by CTV Specialty Television Inc. (Bell Media 80% and ESPN 20%). Its full name (usually prefaced in speech by the French article &quot;le&quot;) translates as &quot;The Sports Network&quot;, the name of its Anglophone counterpart, TSN.

==History==

===September 1, 1989–1990s===
RDS was launched on September 1, 1989, as a sister network to Labatt&#x27;s highly successful English-language sports network TSN, but the new network initially was run on a low budget and struggled to obtain rights to major professional sporting events. Despite this, RDS became infamous in its early years for its program &quot;Défi Mini-Putt&quot;, a weekly miniature golf program best known for its energetic commentator Serge Vleminckx, and his enthusiastic cries of &quot;Birdie!&quot; when a hole in one was scored.

By the early 1990s, the network became more established, obtaining the rights to Montreal Expos, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and some Montreal Canadiens games. Rodger Brulotte became the network&#x27;s second broadcasting star with his enthusiastic colour commentary of Expos games. RDS also covered some of Montreal&#x27;s other professional sports teams, such as the Montreal Machine WLAF football team, the Montreal Impact soccer team, the Montreal Roadrunners roller hockey team, the Montreal Express lacrosse team, and the Montreal Alouettes Canadian football team. While the Machine, Roadrunners, and Express folded, the partnership between RDS and the Impact and Alouettes helped both the network and the teams to become popular. Much of the rise of popularity of Canadian football in Quebec can be attributed to RDS coverage of Canadian Football League and university games. Its small market (mainly limited to Quebec), however, has meant that its revenues are modest. It has had to offer proportionately modest fees for broadcast rights.

Due to CRTC regulations on the foreign ownership of broadcasters, Labatt was forced to sell both RDS and TSN upon its acquisition by Interbrew in 1995. Labatt&#x27;s broadcasting assets were sold to a privately held consortium named NetStar Communications, the investors of which included a number of Canadian firms as well as ESPN Inc., which held an interest of about 30 percent. The same CRTC regulations had prevented ESPN from establishing its own separate Canadian sports networks outright, so acquiring a minority stake in RDS and TSN became ESPN&#x27;s alternative plan to get into the Canadian market.

===2000s===
In 2000, majority ownership of RDS and TSN&#x27;s parent company NetStar was acquired by Bell Globemedia. ESPN still kept minority ownership, and one year later both RDS and TSN adopted ESPN-style logos.

Also in 2000, the Montreal Expos severed their relationship with the network, complaining that they were not offering enough to broadcast games. The network resumed coverage from 2001 until the team moved to Washington, D.C. after the 2004 season, showing about 50 games a season.

In 2002, the Montreal Canadiens announced a deal to license its French-language broadcast rights for all of its preseason, season, and playoff games to RDS. This was controversial as it threatened the longest-running television show in Quebec, Radio-Canada&#x27;s &quot;La Soirée du hockey&quot;. Days later, an agreement was reached whereby RDS and Radio-Canada would simultaneously broadcast Canadiens games on Saturday nights, saving the show. Within the province of Quebec, this arrangement stopped after the 2003–04 NHL season, and French-language Canadiens broadcasts now air exclusively on RDS. Simulcasted coverage continued in regions that do not receive RDS on analog TV (all of Canada south/west of the Ottawa region) on Radio-Canada until the 2006–07 NHL season. In June 2008, RDS&#x27;s parent, CTV Inc., acquired the rights to &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot; after the CBC failed to renew its rights to the theme song. A re-orchestrated version of the tune, which has been the theme song of &quot;La Soirée du hockey&quot; and &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; since 1968, has been used for hockey broadcasts on RDS and TSN beginning in the fall of 2008.

===2010s===
On September 10, 2010, Bell Canada announced plans to re-acquire 100% of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s broadcasting arm, including its majority control of TSN. Under the deal, Woodbridge Company Limited, Torstar, and Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan would together receive $1.3 billion in either cash or equity in BCE, while BCE will also assume $1.7 billion in debt (BCE&#x27;s existing equity interest is $200 million, for a total transaction value of $3.2 billion). Woodbridge has since simultaneously regained majority control of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, with Bell retaining a 15% interest in December 2010. The deal closed on April 1, 2011, after the CRTC approved the sale on March 7, 2011—the new company became known as Bell Media.

In July 2012, Bell submitted a proposal to the CRTC, requesting permission to convert Montreal&#x27;s TSN Radio station CKGM to a French-language station with an RDS-branded sports talk format, known as RDS Radio. The planned language and format change was intended to take advantage of CKAC&#x27;s recent switch from French sports talk to traffic information, and to satisfy the CRTC&#x27;s ownership caps for Bell&#x27;s planned acquisition of Astral Media—since Astral already owned the maximum number of English-language stations that one company can own in the market. Bell&#x27;s original proposal to acquire Astral, and in turn the CKGM proposal, were rejected by the CRTC; under a revised structure (which saw the company divest itself of certain Astral Media properties), Bell would be granted a waiver to maintain ownership of CKGM as an English-language station.

On November 26, 2013, Rogers announced that it had reached a 12-year, $5.2 billion deal to become the exclusive national rightsholder for the National Hockey League, beginning in the 2014–15 season, and would sub-license exclusive French-language rights to TVA Sports (which Rogers has previously partnered with to hold French-language rights to Sportsnet properties), replacing RDS. Previously, due to RDS&#x27;s position as national French rightsholder, the Canadiens forwent a separate regional rights deal and allowed its games to be part of the national French package. Under the new contract, RDS maintained its broadcast rights to 60 Canadiens games per season under a 12-year deal, but Canadiens games are now subject to blackout outside of the Canadiens&#x27; home market region. In January 2014, as part of a wider media rights deal with Bell Media (which included English-language regional television and radio rights for TSN and CFGO), RDS obtained regional broadcast rights to the Ottawa Senators, with 50 regional games in French per season.

In December 2014, as part of deals with Bell, RDS acquired French-language rights to the UEFA Champions League and UFC mixed martial arts, both beginning in 2015.

===2020s===
On May 1, 2022, minor television provider Hay Communications is expected to remove the channel from its channel line-up, due to a sharp increase in cost to deliver the channel.

==Noted RDS programming==
&quot;Sports 30&quot; – Sports news show that provides news and updates regarding major sports in North America and elsewhere.

&quot;Canadien Express&quot; – Condensed version of the previous Montreal Canadiens hockey game in a 60-minute format.

&quot;F1 Express&quot; – Similar concept derived from the &quot;Canadien Express&quot; broadcast.

The Montreal Canadiens hockey game broadcasts formerly varied in name according to the day of the week. Saturday games were known as &quot;Le Hockey du Samedi Soir Coors Light&quot;. Tuesday games were known as &quot;Les Méchants Mardis Molson-Ex&quot; while all of the other day or night games were known as &quot;Le Hockey Subway des Canadiens&quot;. NHL telecasts not involving the Canadiens were simply titled &quot;LNH à RDS&quot;. Since 2014, games have been known as &quot;Le hockey des Canadiens (Bell/Coca-Cola/McDonald&#x27;s).&quot; The sponsor affiliations change from time to time.

In January 2013, RDS and TSN announced a documentary series, &quot;24CH&quot;, following the team.

===Dubbed programming===
Because very few sporting events broadcast by RDS are carried by any other French-language broadcaster, exact simulcasts of other broadcasters on RDS are extremely rare. Even when another French-language broadcaster is carrying the event (e.g., the French Open or soccer matches involving teams from France), RDS will usually use its own commentators. However, for most events that do not either take place in Quebec or involve Quebec-based teams, RDS will rely on the applicable English-language broadcaster (Canadian or American), or some other international broadcast, for the video feed, including any graphics or game updates in the original feed.

The visuals are then dubbed live-to-air with commentators in the RDS studios, who (in most cases) call the game off monitors instead of being on-site. The commentary is not a translation of the English language audio, although the background audio typically remains intact, and relevant information from the English commentary (e.g. injury reports, or explanations of onscreen graphics) may or may not be relayed by the RDS announcers. Interviews aired during the broadcast are undubbed, though RDS announcers will translate and summarize it after completion.

The video is usually delayed by several seconds from the originating feed, in order to ensure that irrelevant items (such as U.S. network promos, apart from those for other events which will also air on RDS) are removed from the RDS broadcast. These are usually replaced by other images of the venue, additional game statistics, or RDS promos.

==RDS2==

On June 15, 2011, Bell Media announced the launch of RDS2, a multiplex channel of RDS similar to TSN&#x27;s equivalent TSN2, in the fall of 2011. The channel will be available in both standard and high definition. On September 19, 2011, Bell Media announced that RDS2&#x27;s launch date will be October 7, 2011.

==High-definition feed==

RDS launched an HD edition of the channel on October 3, 2007, in time for the 2007–08 NHL season, making it the only channel to broadcast all games of the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens in HD. Since then, most major sporting events have been broadcast in HD; including Formula One, NASCAR, Montreal Alouettes CFL Football, NFL, MLB, PGA Golf and the Euro 2008 soccer tournament amongst others. RDS currently broadcasts its HD signal in 1080i format.

==Broadcasting contracts==
At the end of July 2007, RDS and the Montreal Canadiens extended their exclusive broadcasting rights contract through 2013. The deal includes all of the Canadiens&#x27; 82 regular season games and all of their playoff games, if need be (none of this precludes CBC Sports from televising games in English as part of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;). Also, RDS has exclusive French broadcasting rights for the NHL All-Star Game and Skills Contest, as well as one NHL game per week that does not involve the Canadiens and a minimum of 40 playoff games for either RDS or RIS. The Canadiens also granted RDS exclusive rights to &#x27;new media&#x27; coverage for the team (i.e., cell-phone TV, podcast and others).

Most other broadcast contracts are acquired through TSN and ESPN.

In 2013, RDS lost exclusive broadcasting rights over Montreal Canadiens Saturday night games, the playoffs, the NHL All-Star Game and Skills Contest as the NHL dealt those to Rogers Communications with TVA Sports providing French coverage. However, RDS managed secure the broadcasting rights for 60 regional games as those are still dealt by the Montreal Canadiens.

<doc id="575427" wikidata="Q1960950" url="?curid=575427" title="NHL Network (Canadian TV channel)">
<text>NHL Network was a Canadian English language Category B specialty television channel broadcasting ice hockey programming. The channel&#x27;s primary focus was on the National Hockey League (NHL), although it occasionally aired games from other leagues, such as minor league and international circuits, to fill its schedule.

The channel went on the air on October 4, 2001 and was owned by the NHL Network Inc., a venture consisting of the National Hockey League and two of its Canadian member franchises, CTV Specialty Television Inc. (a division of Bell Media and ESPN Inc.), and Insight Sports Ltd. The network&#x27;s ownership structure, which gave the league only an 11.6% interest, was due in part to foreign ownership restrictions for Canadian broadcasters, which prevented the NHL (which, during the channel&#x27;s existence, was owned by 30 member franchises, of which at least 23 were based in the United States) from exercising majority ownership directly.

The network&#x27;s Canadian operations were managed by Bell-owned TSN, the now-former cable rightsholder of the NHL in Canada. Following Rogers Communications&#x27; acquisition of sole national media rights to the NHL in Canada, the Bell Media staff members who operated the network were laid off in July 2015, and NHL Network was shut down entirely on September 1, 2015.

The network&#x27;s U.S. version was not affected by the shutdown; its operations were migrated to the Secaucus, New Jersey facilities of MLB Network as part of a wider partnership between the league and MLB Advanced Media.

==History==
In November 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted approval to former NHL executive Jim Gregory on behalf of a corporation to be incorporated (formed later as The NHL Network Inc.) to launch &quot;The Hockey Channel&quot;, described as &quot;a national English-language Category 2 specialty television dedicated exclusively to all aspects of the game of hockey&quot;. The channel was launched on October 4, 2001 as NHL Network. Its success led the league to create a sister network in the United States in 2007 with many of the same programs.

Even as Rogers Media took over as national television rightsholder of the NHL in Canada beginning in the 2014–15 season, NHL Network remained operated from the facilities of TSN and featured some of its talent. League sources reported that due to the preparations needed for its first season as rightsholder, Rogers was unable to immediately take over the channel, but that Rogers would reconsider its role in NHL Network the following season. TSN could have, alternatively, remained the operating partner of NHL Network beyond the 2014–15 season.

On June 1, 2015, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; columnist David Shoalts reported that NHL Network in Canada would cease operations on September 1, 2015. Bell Media staff members who operated NHL Network on behalf of the partnership were laid off on July 1, 2015. In August 2015, the NHL announced that MLB Advanced Media would take over the U.S. NHL Network and operate it from the broadcast facilities of MLB Network in Secaucus, New Jersey, as well as the league&#x27;s websites, and digital properties such as GameCenter Live (due to Rogers&#x27; rights deal, it will not handle distribution of the service in Canada). The CRTC formally revoked the NHL Network&#x27;s license at its request on September 17, 2015.

In 2021, ESPN, the part owner of TSN, regained the rights to the NHL programming along with Turner Sports in the United States.

<doc id="575443" wikidata="Q1062245" url="?curid=575443" title="Res judicata">
<text>Res judicata or res iudicata, also known as claim preclusion, is the Latin term for &quot;judged matter&quot;, and refers to either of two concepts in common law civil procedure: a case in which there has been a final judgment and that is no longer subject to appeal; and the legal doctrine meant to bar (or preclude) relitigation of a claim between the same parties.

In the case of &quot;res judicata&quot;, the matter cannot be raised again, either in the same court or in a different court. A court will use &quot;res judicata&quot; to deny reconsideration of a matter. The doctrine of &quot;res judicata&quot; is a method of preventing injustice to the parties of a case supposedly finished but perhaps also or mostly a way of avoiding unnecessary waste of judicial resources. &quot;Res judicata&quot; does not merely prevent future judgments from contradicting earlier ones, but also prevents litigants from multiplying judgments.

It is similar to the concept of double jeopardy and &quot;non bis in idem&quot; in criminal law, but the protection in criminal prosecutions only bars an identical prosecution for the same offense. However, a different offense may be charged on identical evidence at a second trial; whereas, &quot;res judicata&quot; precludes any causes of action or claims that may arise from the previously litigated subject matter.

== Common law ==
In common law jurisdictions, the principle of &quot;res judicata&quot; may be asserted either by a judge or a defendant.

Once a final judgment has been handed down in a lawsuit, subsequent judges who are confronted with a suit that is identical to or substantially the same as the earlier one will apply the &quot;res judicata&quot; doctrine to preserve the effect of the first judgment.

A defendant in a lawsuit may use &quot;res judicata&quot; as defense. The general rule is that a plaintiff who prosecuted an action against a defendant and obtained a valid final judgment is not able to initiate another action against the same defendant where:
* the claim is based on the same transaction that was at issue in the first action;
* the plaintiff seeks a different remedy, or further remedy, than was obtained in the first action;
* the claim is of such nature as could have been joined in the first action.

For example, once a bankruptcy plan is confirmed in a court action, the plan is binding on all parties involved. Any question regarding the plan which could have been raised but was not may be barred by &quot;res judicata&quot;.

The Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no fact having been tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examinable in any court of the United States or of any state than according to the rules of law.

For &quot;res judicata&quot; to be binding, several factors must be met:
* identity in the thing at suit;
* identity of the cause at suit;
* identity of the parties to the action;
* identity in the designation of the parties involved;
* whether the judgment was final;
* whether the parties were given full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue.

Regarding &quot;designation of the parties involved&quot;, a person may be involved in an action while filling a given office (e.g. as the agent of another), and may subsequently initiate the same action in a differing capacity (e.g. as his own agent). In that case &quot;res judicata&quot; would not be available as a defence unless the defendant could show that the differing designations were not legitimate and sufficient.

=== Scope ===
&quot;Res judicata&quot; includes two related concepts: claim preclusion and issue preclusion (also called collateral estoppel or issue estoppel), though sometimes &quot;res judicata&quot; is used more narrowly to mean only claim preclusion.

Claim preclusion bars a suit from being brought again on an event which was the subject of a previous legal cause of action that has already been finally decided between the parties or those in privity with a party.

Issue preclusion bars the relitigation of issues of fact or law that have already been necessarily determined by a judge or jury as part of an earlier case.

It is often difficult to determine which, if either, of these concepts apply to later lawsuits that are seemingly related, because many causes of action can apply to the same factual situation and &quot;vice versa&quot;. The scope of an earlier judgment is probably the most difficult question that judges must resolve in applying &quot;res judicata&quot;. Sometimes merely part of the action will be affected. For example, a single claim may be struck from a complaint, or a single factual issue may be removed from reconsideration in the new trial.

&quot;Res judicata&quot; bars matters which were actually decided in an earlier action and also matters which &quot;could&quot; have been decided.

===Rationale===
&quot;Res judicata&quot; is intended to strike a balance between competing interests. Its primary purpose is to assure an efficient judicial system. A related purpose is to create &quot;repose&quot; and finality.

US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart explained the need for this legal precept as follows:

=== Exceptions to application ===
&quot;Res judicata&quot; does not restrict the appeals process, which is considered a linear extension of the same lawsuit as the suit travels up (and back down) the appellate court ladder. Appeals are considered the appropriate manner by which to challenge a judgment rather than trying to start a new trial. Once the appeals process is exhausted or waived, &quot;res judicata&quot; will apply even to a judgment that is contrary to law. In states that permit a judgment to be renewed, a lawsuit to renew the judgment would not be barred by &quot;res judicata&quot;, but in states that do not permit renewal by action (as opposed to renewal by &quot;scire facias&quot; or by motion), such an action would be rejected by the courts as vexatious.

There are limited exceptions to &quot;res judicata&quot; that allow a party to attack the validity of the original judgment, even outside of appeals. These exceptions—usually called collateral attacks—are typically based on procedural or jurisdictional issues, based not on the wisdom of the earlier court&#x27;s decision but its authority or on the competence of the earlier court to issue that decision. A collateral attack is more likely to be available (and to succeed) in judicial systems with multiple jurisdictions, such as under federal governments, or when a domestic court is asked to enforce or recognise the judgment of a foreign court.

In addition, in matters involving due process, cases that appear to be &quot;res judicata&quot; may be re-litigated. An example would be the establishment of a right to counsel. People who have had liberty taken away (i.e., imprisoned) may be allowed to be re-tried with a counselor as a matter of fairness.

&quot;Res judicata&quot; may not apply in cases involving the &quot;England&quot; reservation. If a litigant files suit in federal court, and that court stays proceedings to allow a state court to consider the questions of state law, the litigant may inform the state court that he reserves any federal-law issues in the action for federal court. If he makes such a reservation, &quot;res judicata&quot; would not bar him from returning the case to federal court at conclusion of action in state court.

There is a declaratory judgment exception to &quot;res judicata&quot;. &quot;[A] declaratory action determines only what it actually decides and does not have a claim preclusive effect on other contentions that might have been advanced.&quot; Therefore, &quot;a plaintiff who has lost a declaratory judgment action may also bring a subsequent action for other relief, subject to the constraint of the determinations made in the declaratory action.&quot; This exception has been adopted in Oregon, Texas, and a number of other U.S. states.

&quot;Res judicata&quot; may be avoided if claimant was not afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue decided by a state court. He could file suit in a federal court to challenge the adequacy of the state&#x27;s procedures. In that case the federal suit would be against the state and not against the defendant in the first suit.

&quot;Res judicata&quot; will not apply if consent (or tacit agreement) is justification for splitting a claim. If plaintiff splits a claim in the course of a suit for special or justifiable reasons for doing so, a judgment in that action may not have the usual consequence of extinguishing the entire claim.

However, once a case has been appealed, finality of the appellate court&#x27;s decision is vindicated in that proceeding by giving effect in later proceedings involving the same matter, whether in the appellate or lower courts. This is the law of the case doctrine.

=== Failure to apply ===
When a subsequent court fails to apply &quot;res judicata&quot; and renders a contradictory verdict on the same claim or issue, if a third court is faced with the same case, it will likely apply a &quot;last in time&quot; rule, giving effect only to the later judgment, even though the result came out differently the second time. This situation is not unheard of, as it is typically the responsibility of the parties to the suit to bring the earlier case to the judge&#x27;s attention, and the judge must decide how broadly to apply it, or whether to recognise it in the first place. 

==Civil law==

The doctrine of &quot;res judicata&quot; in nations that have a civil law legal system is much narrower in scope than in common law nations. In civil law countries adopting German law concept, such as Japan and Taiwan, the &quot;res judicata&quot; () is in close connection with the cause of action (). However, the theory of cause of action itself is different in Germany and Japan and Taiwan, therefore the scope of &quot;res judicata&quot; are different in the above countries.

==International law==
&quot;Res judicata&quot; applies in international arbitration and other proceedings. Article 59 of the International Court of Justice Statute states &quot;The decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case&quot;; this article, taken together with Article 60, &quot;The judgment is final without appeal&quot;, is a clear statement of the principle of &quot;res judicata&quot; - that the same parties may not relitigate a case that has already been adjudicated.

Additionally, under Article 38 (1)(c) of the same statute, it is considered a &quot;general principle of law recognized by civilized nations&quot;. The applicability of the principle was confirmed in the &quot;Corfu Channel case&quot; (1947-49) and the &quot;Barcelona Traction Co. Case&quot; (1970).

Most of the species in &quot;Nemophila&quot; contain the phrase &quot;baby blue eyes&quot; in their common names. &quot;N. menziesii&quot; has the common name of &quot;baby blue eyes&quot;. &quot;N. parviflora&quot; is called the &quot;smallflower baby blue-eyes&quot; and &quot;N. spatulata&quot; is called the &quot;Sierra baby blue eyes&quot;. An exception to this naming tendency is &quot;N. maculata&quot;, whose common name is fivespot.

&quot;Nemophila&quot; species are mainly native to the western United States, though some species are also found in Mexico, and in the southeastern United States. They are commonly offered for sale for garden cultivation. Generally these are &quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot;.

==Description==
All species of &quot;Nemophila&quot; are annuals, and most bloom in the spring. Their flowers have five petals and are bell or cup-shaped, and purple, blue, or white in color, often spotted or marked. The stamens are included and there is only one ovary chamber.

The leaves are simple, with an opposite or alternate arrangement. The petiole is generally bristly. The leaf blade is pinnately toothed or lobed.

The fruit is 2–7 mm wide and generally enclosed by the calyx. The fruit itself is spherical to ovoid in shape. It is also hairy.

The seeds are ovoid, smooth, wrinkled or pitted. At one end there is a colorless, conic appendage.

==Occurrence==
Generally the genus is native to United States of America, (they are found within the states of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming), Canada (they are found within the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia) and Mexico.

Some of the species of &quot;Nemophila&quot; are of restricted range. For example, &quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot; has been observed only in western North America, but chiefly in California. &quot;Nemophila heterophylla&quot; occurs in a more restricted range within northern and central California (with some proximate state populations); &quot;N. heterophylla&quot; has the greatest number of sightings in Marin County at locations such as Ring Mountain.

==Etymology==
&quot;Nemophila&quot; means &quot;woodland-loving&quot;, from the Greek words νέμος (némos) meaning wooded pasture, glade and &quot;philos&quot;, which means &quot;loving&quot;.

==Species==
There are 13 accepted species in &quot;Nemophila&quot;, according to Plants of the World Online, Kew.

<text>Interleukins (ILs) are a group of cytokines (secreted proteins and signal molecules) that are expressed and secreted by white blood cells (leukocytes) as well as some other body cells. The human genome encodes more than 50 interleukins and related proteins.

The function of the immune system primarily depends on interleukins, and rare deficiencies of a number of them have been described, all featuring autoimmune diseases or immune deficiency. The majority of interleukins are synthesized by CD4 helper T-lymphocytes, as well as through monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. They promote the development and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes, and hematopoietic cells.

Interleukin receptors on astrocytes in the hippocampus are also known to be involved in the development of spatial memories in mice.

== History and name ==

The name &quot;interleukin&quot; was chosen in 1979, to replace the various different names used by different research groups to designate interleukin 1 (lymphocyte activating factor, mitogenic protein, T-cell replacing factor III, B-cell activating factor, B-cell differentiation factor, and &quot;Heidikine&quot;) and interleukin 2 (TSF, etc.). This decision was taken during the Second International Lymphokine Workshop in Switzerland (27–31 May 1979 in Ermatingen).

The term &quot;interleukin&quot; derives from (&quot;inter-&quot;) &quot;as a means of communication&quot;, and (&quot;-leukin&quot;) &quot;deriving from the fact that many of these proteins are produced by leukocytes and act on leukocytes&quot;. The name is something of a relic; it has since been found that interleukins are produced by a wide variety of body cells. The term was coined by Dr Vern Paetkau, University of Victoria.

Some interleukins are classified as lymphokines, lymphocyte-produced cytokines that mediate immune responses.

==Common families==

===Interleukin 1===
Interleukin 1 alpha and interleukin 1 beta (IL1 alpha and IL1 beta) are cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune responses, inflammatory reactions, and hematopoiesis. Two types of IL-1 receptor, each with three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, limited sequence similarity (28%) and different pharmacological characteristics have been cloned from mouse and human cell lines: these have been termed type I and type II receptors. The receptors both exist in transmembrane (TM) and soluble forms: the soluble IL-1 receptor is thought to be post-translationally derived from cleavage of the extracellular portion of the membrane receptors.

Both IL-1 receptors (CD121a/IL1R1, CD121b/IL1R2) appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location. The receptors can both bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist).

The crystal structures of IL1A and IL1B have been solved, showing them to share the same 12-stranded beta-sheet structure as both the heparin binding growth factors and the Kunitz-type soybean trypsin inhibitors. The beta-sheets are arranged in 4 similar lobes around a central axis, 8 strands forming an anti-parallel beta-barrel. Several regions, especially the loop between strands 4 and 5, have been implicated in receptor binding.

Molecular cloning of the Interleukin 1 Beta converting enzyme is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of an inactive precursor molecule. A complementary DNA encoding protease that carries out this cleavage has been cloned. Recombinant expression enables cells to process precursor Interleukin 1 Beta to the mature form of the enzyme.

Interleukin 1 also plays a role in the central nervous system. Research indicates that mice with a genetic deletion of the type I IL-1 receptor display markedly impaired hippocampal-dependent memory functioning and long-term potentiation, although memories that do not depend on the integrity of the hippocampus seem to be spared. However, when mice with this genetic deletion have wild-type neural precursor cells injected into their hippocampus and these cells are allowed to mature into astrocytes containing the interleukin-1 receptors, the mice exhibit normal hippocampal-dependent memory function, and partial restoration of long-term potentiation.

===Interleukin 2===
T lymphocytes regulate the growth and differentiation of T cells and certain B cells through the release of secreted protein factors. These factors, which include interleukin 2 (IL2), are secreted by lectin- or antigen-stimulated T cells, and have various physiological effects. IL2 is a lymphokine that induces the proliferation of responsive T cells. In addition, it acts on some B cells, via receptor-specific binding, as a growth factor and antibody production stimulant. The protein is secreted as a single glycosylated polypeptide, and cleavage of a signal sequence is required for its activity. Solution NMR suggests that the structure of IL2 comprises a bundle of 4 helices (termed A-D), flanked by 2 shorter helices and several poorly defined loops. Residues in helix A, and in the loop region between helices A and B, are important for receptor binding. Secondary structure analysis has suggested similarity to IL4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF).

===Interleukin 3===
Interleukin 3 (IL3) is a cytokine that regulates hematopoiesis by controlling the production, differentiation and function of granulocytes and macrophages. The protein, which exists in vivo as a monomer, is produced in activated T cells and mast cells, and is activated by the cleavage of an N-terminal signal sequence.

IL3 is produced by T lymphocytes and T-cell lymphomas only after stimulation with antigens, mitogens, or chemical activators such as phorbol esters. However, IL3 is constitutively expressed in the myelomonocytic leukaemia cell line WEHI-3B. It is thought that the genetic change of the cell line to constitutive production of IL3 is the key event in development of this leukaemia.

===Interleukin 4===
Interleukin 4 (IL4) is produced by CD4+ T cells specialized in providing help to B cells to proliferate and to undergo class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Th2 cells, through production of IL-4, have an important function in B-cell responses that involve class switch recombination to the IgG1 and IgE isotypes.

===Interleukin 5===
Interleukin 5 (IL5), also known as eosinophil differentiation factor (EDF), is a lineage-specific cytokine for eosinophilpoiesis. It regulates eosinophil growth and activation, and thus plays an important role in diseases associated with increased levels of eosinophils, including asthma. IL5 has a similar overall fold to other cytokines (e.g., IL2, IL4 and GCSF), but while these exist as monomeric structures, IL5 is a homodimer. The fold contains an anti-parallel 4-alpha-helix bundle with a left handed twist, connected by a 2-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The monomers are held together by 2 interchain disulphide bonds.

===Interleukin 6===
Interleukin 6 (IL6), also referred to as B-cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2) and interferon beta-2, is a cytokine involved in a wide variety of biological functions. It plays an essential role in the final differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells, as well as inducing myeloma/plasmacytoma growth, nerve cell differentiation, and, in hepatocytes, acute-phase reactants.

A number of other cytokines may be grouped with IL6 on the basis of sequence similarity. These include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and myelomonocytic growth factor (MGF). GCSF acts in hematopoiesis by affecting the production, differentiation, and function of two related white cell groups in the blood. MGF also acts in hematopoiesis, stimulating proliferation and colony formation of normal and transformed avian cells of the myeloid lineage.

Cytokines of the IL6/GCSF/MGF family are glycoproteins of about 170 to 180 amino acid residues that contain four conserved cysteine residues involved in two disulphide bonds. They have a compact, globular fold (similar to other interleukins), stabilised by the two disulphide bonds. One half of the structure is dominated by a 4-alpha-helix bundle with a left-handed twist; the helices are anti-parallel, with two overhand connections, which fall into a double-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The fourth alpha-helix is important to the biological activity of the molecule.

===Interleukin 7 ===
Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is a cytokine that serves as a growth factor for early lymphoid cells of both B- and T-cell lineages.

===Interleukin 8===

Interleukin 8 is a chemokine produced by macrophages and other cell types such as epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Endothelial cells store IL-8 in their storage vesicles, the Weibel-Palade bodies. In humans, the interleukin-8 protein is encoded by the &quot;CXCL8&quot; gene. IL-8 is initially produced as a precursor peptide of 99 amino acids which then undergoes cleavage to create several active IL-8 isoforms. In culture, a 72 amino acid peptide is the major form secreted by macrophages.

There are many receptors on the surface membrane capable of binding IL-8; the most frequently studied types are the G protein-coupled serpentine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. Expression and affinity for IL-8 differs between the two receptors (CXCR1 &gt; CXCR2). Through a chain of biochemical reactions, IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response.

=== Interleukin 9 ===
Interleukin 9 (IL-9) is a cytokine that supports IL-2 independent and IL-4 independent growth of helper T cells. Early studies had indicated that Interleukin 9 and 7 seem to be evolutionary related and Pfam, InterPro and PROSITE entries exist for interleukin 7/interleukin 9 family. However, a recent study has shown that IL-9 is, in fact, much closer to both IL-2 and IL-15, than to IL-7. Moreover, the study showed irreconcilable structural differences between IL-7 and all the remaining cytokines signalling through the γc receptor ( IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21).

===Interleukin 10===
Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a protein that inhibits the synthesis of a number of cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, TNF, and GM-CSF produced by activated macrophages and by helper T cells. In structure, IL-10 is a protein of about 160 amino acids that contains four conserved cysteines involved in disulphide bonds. IL-10 is highly similar to the &quot;Human herpesvirus 4&quot; (Epstein-Barr virus) BCRF1 protein, which inhibits the synthesis of gamma-interferon and to &quot;Equid herpesvirus 2&quot; (Equine herpesvirus 2) protein E7. It is also similar, but to a lesser degree, with human protein mda-7. a protein that has antiproliferative properties in human melanoma cells. Mda-7 contains only two of the four cysteines of IL-10.

===Interleukin 11===
Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a secreted protein that stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis, initially thought to lead to an increased production of platelets (it has since been shown to be redundant to normal platelet formation), as well as activating osteoclasts, inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and inhibiting macrophage mediator production. These functions may be particularly important in mediating the hematopoietic, osseous and mucosal protective effects of interleukin 11.

===Interleukin 12===
Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a disulphide-bonded heterodimer consisting of a 35kDa alpha subunit and a 40kDa beta subunit. It is involved in the stimulation and maintenance of Th1 cellular immune responses, including the normal host defence against various intracellular pathogens, such as Leishmania, Toxoplasma, &quot;Measles virus&quot;, and &quot;Human immunodeficiency virus 1&quot; (HIV). IL-12 also has an important role in enhancing the cytotoxic function of NK cells and role in pathological Th1 responses, such as in inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Suppression of IL-12 activity in such diseases may have therapeutic benefit. On the other hand, administration of recombinant IL-12 may have therapeutic benefit in conditions associated with pathological Th2 responses.

===Interleukin 13===
Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic cytokine that may be important in the regulation of the inflammatory and immune responses. It inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and synergises with IL-2 in regulating interferon-gamma synthesis. The sequences of IL-4 and IL-13 are distantly related.

===Interleukin 15===
Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a cytokine that possesses a variety of biological functions, including stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses. IL-15 stimulates the proliferation of T lymphocytes, which requires interaction of IL-15 with IL-15R alpha and components of IL-2R, including IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma (common gamma chain, γc), but not IL-2R alpha.

===Interleukin 17===
Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated memory T cells. This cytokine is characterized by its proinflammatory properties, role in recruiting neutrophils, and importance in innate and adaptive immunity. Not only does IL-17 play a key role in inflammation of many autoimmune diseases, such as RA, allergies, asthma, psoriasis, and more, but it also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Additionally, some studies have found that IL-17 plays a role in tumorigenesis (initial formation of a tumor) and transplant rejection. The IL-17 family is thought to represent a distinct signaling system that appears to have been highly conserved across vertebrate evolution.

<text>&quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, originally &quot;It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the Broken Hearted)&quot;, is a song written by Per Gessle and performed by the Swedish pop duo Roxette. The power ballad became the duo&#x27;s third number one hit in the United States, and is one of their best selling releases, being certified gold or platinum in a number of countries. It remains their most well-known and signature song.

Five different versions of the song have been officially released. The original song was released in 1987, which was followed by the most successful incarnation, a slightly edited and overdubbed version, omitting the Christmas references, created for the soundtrack to the 1990 film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. During the &quot;Join the Joyride! World Tour&quot; in 1991, the band recorded a country music version in Los Angeles, included on their 1992 album &quot;Tourism&quot;. A Spanish-language version of the &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; recording was released on their 1996 compilation &quot;Baladas en Español&quot;. Finally, an orchestral live performance from the band&#x27;s 2009 concert at Night of the Proms was included on their 2012 studio album, &quot;Travelling&quot;.

==Original release (1987)==
The song was first released as &quot;It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the Broken Hearted)&quot; in December 1987. It was composed after EMI Germany asked the duo to &quot;come up with an intelligent Christmas single&quot;. It became a top five hit in Sweden, but was not released internationally. This version of the song was never included on any Roxette studio album until the 1997 re-release of their debut &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot; (1986).

===Music video===
A performance from a Swedish TV chart show in 1987 acted as the song&#x27;s first music video. It features Fredriksson and Gessle sitting on a couch on a stage, lip-syncing to the song.

==Re-release (1990)==
During a run of increasingly successful singles from the duo&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;, Touchstone Pictures approached Roxette and their label about contributing a song to the soundtrack of the upcoming romantic comedy release &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. The film was released in March 1990 and went on to make more than US$460 million at the worldwide box office. The corresponding soundtrack album was also a commercial success, which was certified triple-platinum in the US. The soundtrack went on to sell more than nine million copies worldwide.

===Critical reception===
Bill Coleman from &quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as a &quot;rhythmic ballad&quot;. Dave Sholin from the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; wrote: &quot;Per and Marie are on target again. Per Gessle continues to demonstrate his uncanny ability to compose exceptional pop melodies and Marie Fredriksson makes the words and music jump through the speakers. Though timed to coincide with the release of the Julia Roberts/Richard Gere film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, this tune from the soundtrack could easily stand on its own. Interest in the movie only gives it that much more of a boost&quot;. Dave Simpson from &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the song is a &quot;masterpiece of pain&quot;. He added that &quot;Fredriksson&#x27;s genius is in delivering the title line clean and stoic, rather than with tortured vibrato, to show that she&#x27;s resigned to her fate. But with the jarringly urgent upward key change in the middle eight, the pain floods in again, and she&#x27;s back to square one&quot;.

A reviewer from &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a ballad, it&#x27;s big in America, but it&#x27;s not as heavy-handed as the usual US success. Funnily enough, there even seems to be a bit of an ABBA influence in there&quot;. Refinery29 included it at number 39 on their list of &quot;The Saddest Breakup Songs of All Time&quot;, saying the track &quot;represents the perfect ratio of schlock to sentiment. In someone like Celine Dion&#x27;s hands, this would have been a complete disaster, but the Swedish duo gaze off to &#x27;where the water flows&#x27; and &#x27;where the wind blows&#x27; without sounding like &#x27;90s Disney characters&quot;. Brendon Veevers from &quot;Renowned for Sound&quot; noted the song as a &quot;timeless power ballad that has aged like a fine wine&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
A re-written and edited version of the track – the lyric &quot;It&#x27;s a hard Christmas day&quot; was changed to &quot;It&#x27;s a hard winter&#x27;s day&quot; and 24 seconds were removed from the outro – became an international hit during the summer of 1990. It was not the first single released from the &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; soundtrack, but it became the most successful, spending two weeks at the top spot of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June. The song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the US. At the end of the year, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed it as the second most successful single of 1990, behind Wilson Phillips&#x27; &quot;Hold On&quot;.

The single peaked at number three in the UK—their highest-peaking single there. It stayed on the UK Singles Chart for 14 weeks, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales and streams in excess of 400,000. The song was re-released in the UK and Ireland in September 1993 to tie in with the TV premiere of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, peaking at number ten in both countries. It became Roxette&#x27;s second of three number one singles in Australia, spending two weeks at the top spot in July 1990. The song was a massive hit in Norway, where it spent twelve weeks at number one. In Switzerland, the song spent three non-consecutive weeks at number one. It also reached number one in Canada, Poland and Spain, and the top five in Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and West Germany, where it spent nine months in the top 75.

In 2005, Gessle received an award from BMI after the song&#x27;s four millionth radio play in the US. He received updated awards from the same organization after its five millionth radio play in 2014, and its six millionth play in 2021.

===Music video===
The second video was directed by Doug Freel and was shot in a warehouse. It included clips from &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, with Fredriksson singing and playing piano and Gessle playing guitar between various prop changes. There is also an alternate version of the video, without the movie scenes, which was available solely on the VHS &quot;The Videos&quot;. According to Fredriksson, shooting this video was a surreal experience, as Freel &quot;wanted all movements in slow motion, so I had to lip-sync the vocals at double speed. My first lesson in how to sing an emotional ballad Mickey Mouse style&quot;.

As of January 2025, this video has more than 854 million views on YouTube.

Roxette released a Spanish-language compilation album, &quot;Baladas en Español&quot;, in 1996.

The album was only released in Spanish and Portuguese-speaking territories. An adapted version of &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, titled &quot;No Sé Si Es Amor&quot;, was released in early 1997 as the album&#x27;s second and final single.

<text>Luxeuil Abbey (), the &quot;Abbaye Saint-Pierre et Saint-Paul&quot;, was one of the oldest and best-known monasteries in Franche-Comté, located in what is now the département of Haute-Saône in Franche-Comté, France.

==History==
===Columbanus===
The abbey was founded circa 590 by the Irish missionary Saint Columbanus. Columbanus and his companions first settled in cells at Annegray, in the commune of Voivre, Haute-Saône. Looking for a more permanent site for his community, Columbanus decided upon the ruins of a well-fortified Gallo-Roman settlement, &quot;Luxovium&quot;, about eight miles away. 

The Roman town had been ravaged by Attila in 451, and was now buried in the dense overgrown woodland that had filled the abandoned site over more than a century, but the place still had the advantage of the thermal baths (&quot;constructed with unusual skill&quot;, according to Columbanus&#x27; early biographer, Jonas of Bobbio) down in the valley, which still give the town its name of Luxeuil-les-Bains. Jonas described it further: &quot;There stone images crowded the nearby woods, which were honoured in the miserable cult and profane former rites in the time of the pagans&quot;.

With a grant from an officer of the palace at Childebert&#x27;s court, an abbey church was built with a sense of triumph within the heathen site and its &quot;spectral haunts&quot;.

Under the intellectual and spiritual stimulation of the Irish monks, the abbey at Luxeuil, dedicated to Saint Peter, soon became the most important and flourishing monastery in Gaul. The community was so large that choir followed choir in the chanting of the office, and at Luxeuil the &quot;laus perennis&quot; imported from Agaunum went on day and night.

Most of the earliest rule that was observed at Luxeuil derived from Celtic monastic traditions, whether or not written down by Columbanus, supplemented increasingly by the more formalized Benedictine Rule that was followed throughout the West, which provided for the abbot&#x27;s orderly election, his relations with his monks, and the appointment of monastic officials and their delegated powers. In 603, a synod accused Columbanus of keeping Easter by the Celtic date, but his severity and the inflexible rule he had established may have been the true cause of friction with the Burgundian court.

===Eustace of Luxeuil===
Columbanus was exiled from Luxeuil by Theuderic II of Austrasia and the dowager Queen Brunehaut. He was succeeded as abbot by Saint Eustace of Luxeuil, the head of the monastic school, which under Eustace and his successor Saint Waldebert, established a high reputation. The extensive library and the great scriptorium are first attested under Abbot Waldebert (629–670).

The school and example of Luxeuil contributed significantly to the conversion of the Burgundians. Luxeuil sent out monks to found houses at Bobbio, between Milan and Genoa, where Columbanus himself became abbot, and monasteries at Saint-Valéry and Remiremont. To Luxeuil came such monks as Conon, abbot of Lérins Abbey to prepare for the reform of his monastery, and Saints Wandregisel and Philibert, founders respectively of the abbeys of Fontenelle and Jumièges in Normandy, who spent years in studying the rule observed in monasteries which derived their origin from Luxeuil.

===Saracen, Viking and Hungarian raids===
About 732, a raiding party of Moors under the general Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, governor of Al-Andalus, penetrating from Arles deep into Burgundy, briefly took possession of Luxeuil and massacred most of the community, including Abbot Mellinus. The few survivors rebuilt the abbey. In 816, under the reforming government of the eighteenth abbot, Saint Ansegisus, the Emperor Louis the Pious renewed its charters, restored the church and monastic buildings, and reformed discipline. The monastery and the small town that clustered around its walls were devastated by the Vikings in about 886. In 917, it was sacked by the Hungarians.

===Modern period===
From the 15th century the institution of non-resident commendatory abbots encouraged the decline of discipline. The Emperor Charles V curtailed the power of Luxeuil&#x27;s abbots.

In 1634, however, the commendatory abbots ceased, and Luxeuil was joined to the reformed Congregation of St. Vanne. From the report of the &quot;Commission des Réguliers&quot;, drawn up in 1768, the community appears to have been numerous and flourishing, and discipline well kept.

===French Revolution===
At the French Revolution the monks were dispersed. Most of the abbey&#x27;s site is built over by the modern town, but the fine Gothic church, built in the 14th century, was not destroyed; neither were the cloisters and conventual buildings, which until the &quot;Association Laws&quot; of 1901 were used as a seminary for the diocese of Besançon, and still remain in existence. The church itself, now known as the Basilica of St. Pierre (), has for many years served as the parish church of Luxeuil-les-Bains.

The plant is native to California, Baja California, and Oregon.

It grows virtually throughout California at elevations from sea level up to almost . It grows in many types of habitats, including chaparral, valley grasslands, and montane locales.

==Description==
&quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot; is variable in appearance. Lower leaves are stalked, lobed and oppositely arranged, with five to thirteen lobes, each entire or with one to three teeth. Upper leaves are more or less sessile and less lobed than lower. The stalk of the inflorescence is . Calyx lobes are . The flower is blue with a white center or all white, usually with blue veins and black dots near the center. It is wide. The tube is less than or equal to the filaments.

===Varieties===
The species includes three varieties:
*&quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot; var. &quot;atomaria&quot; has white flowers with black dots, often with a faint blue tint or blue veins in the corolla. It is found on coastal bluffs or grassy slopes in Oregon, Northwestern California, the Central Coast of California, and the San Francisco Bay Area.
*&quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot; var. &quot;integrifolia&quot; has blue flowers, with black dots at the center and deep blue veins. It is found in grasslands, canyons, woodlands, and slopes in the Central Coast, southern Coast Ranges, southwestern California, east of the Sierra Nevada range, and into the Mojave Desert and Baja California
*&quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot; has bright blue flowers with white centers that are generally dotted with black. It is found virtually throughout California, in meadows, grasslands, chaparral, woodlands, slopes, and desert washes, but it does not occur above .

<doc id="575482" wikidata="Q713486" url="?curid=575482" title="Goh Keng Swee">
<text>Goh Keng Swee (6 October 1918 – 14 May 2010), born Robert Goh Keng Swee, was a Singaporean statesman and economist who served as 2nd Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore between 1973 and 1985. Goh is widely recognised as one of the founding fathers of Singapore. He was also one of the founders of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), which has governed the country continuously since independence.

Goh was a prominent member of the country&#x27;s first generation of political leaders after Singapore became independent in 1965. He served as Minister for Finance between 1959 and 1965, and again between 1967 and 1970, Minister for Interior and Defence between 1965 and 1967, Minister for Defence between 1970 and 1979 and Minister for Education between 1979 and 1985.

As Minister for Interior and Defence, Goh&#x27;s main objective was to strengthen the country&#x27;s military and domestic security capabilities after the British had withdrawn its troops from Singapore, which made the newly-independent nation vulnerable. A key policy was the creation of National Service (NS), a mandatory conscription system for able-bodied young males. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had mentioned that he had wanted a conscription consisting both men and women similar to Israel. However, Goh rejected it, citing that the labour cost at least in its initial years would be too great for the newly-independent nation.

During Goh&#x27;s tenure as Minister for Finance, he declined to allow the central bank to issue currency, favouring instead a currency board system as this would signal to citizens, academics and the financial world that governments cannot &quot;spend their way to prosperity&quot;; the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was later established in 1971. In 1981, Goh also expressed the view that the central bank need not hold large amounts of cash in reserve to defend the currency, proposing that the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) be established to invest excess reserves. At the time, it was unprecedented for a non-commodity-based economy to have such a sovereign wealth fund, and was initially seen as a risky venture that eventually paid dividends. The multinational merchant bank, Rothschild &amp; Co, had also advised on the GIC during its early years. Goh died in 2010 at the age of 91, and he was accorded a state funeral.

==Early life and career==

Goh was born in Malacca on 6 October 1918 into a middle class Peranakan family, the fifth of six children. His father Goh Leng Inn, was a manager of a rubber plantation, while his mother Tan Swee Eng, was from the family that produced the Malaysian politicians Tan Cheng Lock and his son, Tan Siew Sin, who would later become Goh&#x27;s lifelong political opponent.

Goh was given the Christian name Robert, which he disliked and refused to respond to. When he was two years old, his family moved from Malacca to Singapore where his maternal grandparents owned several properties. The Gohs later relocated to the Pasir Panjang rubber estate when his father found work there, and became manager in 1933. In common with many Peranakan families, the Gohs spoke both English and Malay at home; church services were held at home on Sundays in Malay. Goh&#x27;s father Leng Inn and the latter&#x27;s brothers-in-law Chew Cheng Yong and Goh Hood Keng taught in the Anglo-Chinese School for various periods, and were also involved in the Middle Road Baba Church while Hood Keng was pastor there. Goh attended the church as well.

Goh attended the Anglo-Chinese School between 1927 and 1936 where he was second in his class in the Senior Cambridge examinations, Goh graduated from Raffles College (now the National University of Singapore) in 1939 with a Class II Diploma in Arts with a special distinction in economics. 

After graduation, Goh joined the colonial Civil Service as a tax collector with the War Tax Department but, according to his superiors, was not very good at his job and was almost fired. Shortly after the start of Second World War, he joined the Singapore Volunteer Corps, a local militia, but returned to his previous work after the fall of Singapore. 

Goh married Alice Woon, a secretary who was a colleague, in 1942 and they have one son, Goh Kian Chee, two years later. In 1945, he relocated his young family to Malacca, but returned to Singapore the following year after the Japanese occupation ended. That year, he joined the Department of Social Welfare, and was active in the post-war administration. He became a supervisor of the Department&#x27;s Research Section six months later.

Goh attained a scholarship which enabled him to further his studies at the London School of Economics. During his time in London, Goh met fellow students seeking independence for British Malaya, including Abdul Razak, Maurice Baker, Lee Kuan Yew and Toh Chin Chye. A student discussion group, the Malayan Forum, was formed in 1948 with Goh as the founding chairman. Goh graduated in 1951 with a first class honours in economics, and won the William Farr Prize for achieving the highest marks in statistics. Upon his return to the Department of Social Welfare, he was appointed Assistant Secretary of Research. In 1952, together with fellow civil servant Kenneth Michael Byrne, he formed the Council of Joint Action to lobby against salary and promotion policies that favoured Europeans over Asians. Byrne later became Minister for Labour and Minister for Law.

In 1954, Goh was able to return to the London School of Economics for doctoral studies with the help of a scholarship conferred by the University of London. He completed his PhD in economics in 1956, and returned to the Department of Social Welfare, where he served as Assistant Director and subsequently as Director. In 1958, he was appointed Director of the Social and Economic Research Division in the Chief Minister&#x27;s Office. He resigned from the civil service in August that year to work full-time for the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP).
==Political career==
===Pre-independence===
Goh was a key member of the PAP&#x27;s Central Executive Committee (CEC), and serving as Vice-Chairman. 

Goh contested in Kreta Ayer during the 1959 general election and won. He was subsequently elected into the Legislative Assembly on 30 May 1959, and appointed Minister for Finance under Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s first Cabinet. 

As Minister for Finance, Goh assumed the stewardship of Singapore&#x27;s economy. As a budget deficit of S$14 million was forecast that year, he introduced stringent fiscal discipline which including cutting civil service salaries. As a result of these measures, he was able to announce at the end of the year when delivering the budget that the government had achieved a surplus of $1 million. 

Goh initiated the setting up of the Economic Development Board (EDB) which was established in August 1961 to attract foreign multinational corporations to invest in Singapore. The next year, he started the development of the Jurong industrial estate on the western end of the island which was then a swamp, offering incentives to local and foreign businesses to locate there. According to former Permanent Secretary Sim Kee Boon, Goh admitted that the Jurong project was &quot;an act of faith and he himself jokingly said that this could prove to be Goh&#x27;s folly&quot;. Nonetheless, Goh also felt strongly that &quot;the only way to avoid making mistakes is not to do anything. And that... will be the ultimate mistake.&quot;

In the 1960s, there were great pressures from communist agitators working through Chinese-medium schools and trade unions. Divisions existed within the PAP as well, with a pro-communist faction working to wrest control of the party from the moderate wing, of which Goh and Lee Kuan Yew were key members. A key source of division was the issue of merger with Malaya to form a new state of Malaysia. Goh and his fellow moderates believed this was a necessary condition for Singapore&#x27;s economic development because Malaya was a key economic hinterland; merger would also provide an alternate vision against communism for Singapore&#x27;s Chinese majority. In July 1961, 16 members of the pro-communist faction broke away from the PAP to form the Barisan Sosialis, and captured control of the main trade unions.

===Federation of Malaysia===
The Singapore Government attained approval from Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman for a merger in 1961, with the Tunku being motivated by a desire to stabilise the security situation in Singapore, and notably to neutralise the perceived communist threat. Singapore merged with Malaya and the British Borneo states in 1963 to form the Federation of Malaysia. 

Merger, however, proved to be problematic for the Singapore leaders. There was a clash of fundamental principles, both political and economic, notably on the issue of Malay dominance. Communitarian violence in 1964 was inflamed in Singapore by Malay and Chinese activists. According to Lee Kuan Yew, Goh fought to protect Singapore&#x27;s interests against the Federal Minister of Finance, his cousin Tan Siew Sin, &quot;who was out to spite Singapore&quot;. Goh played a crucial role in orchestrating the subsequent secession of Singapore from the Federation on 9 August 1965.

After two difficult years, Lee asked him to negotiate with the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak and Minister for External Affairs Ismail Abdul Rahman in July 1965 for Singapore to have a looser arrangement with Malaysia within the Federation. However, following the discussions, Goh ultimately decided that it would be better for Malaysia and Singapore to have a clean break and go on their separate ways.

===Post-independence===
====Minister for Interior and Defence (1965–1967) ====
Upon the independence of Singapore in 1965, Goh relinquished his portfolio of Minister for Finance and became Minister for Interior and Defence in 1967, assuming responsibilities for strengthening Singapore&#x27;s military and domestic security capabilities. A key policy was the creation of National Service, a mandatory conscription system for able-bodied young males.

====Minister for Finance (1967–1970)====
Goh served as Minister for Finance again between 1967 and 1970, during which he declined to allow the central bank to issue currency, favouring instead a currency board system as this would signal to citizens, academics and the financial world that governments cannot &quot;spend their way to prosperity&quot;. 

====Minister for Defence (1970–1979)====
On 11 August 1970, he was reappointed Minister for Defence.

====Deputy Prime Minister (1973–1984)====
On 1 March 1973, Goh was appointed Deputy Prime Minister concurrently with his other Cabinet portfolio. 

On 12 February 1979, Goh moved on from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Education, where his Goh Report greatly influenced the development of Singapore&#x27;s education system. He was described as both a key political and strategic leader responsible for the transformation of the system over 30 years from &quot;fair&quot; to &quot;great&quot;, according to a November 2010 McKinsey report. He set up the Curriculum Development Institute, and introduced key policies such as religious education—subsequently discontinued and, in 1980, the channelling of students into different programmes of study according to their learning abilities, known as &quot;streaming&quot;. Goh served two terms as Minister for Education, his first term ended in 1980, and his second following the 1980 general election from 1981 until his retirement in 1985. 

From 1 June 1980, he was redesignated First Deputy Prime Minister upon S. Rajaratnam being made Second Deputy Prime Minister, and served as Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore until he stepped down from Parliament on 3 December 1984, at the age of 66. 

In a tribute to mark the occasion, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew wrote: &quot;A whole generation of Singaporeans take their present standard of living for granted because you had laid the foundations of the economy of modern Singapore.&quot;

===Other contributions===
====Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC)====
In 1981, Goh expressed the view that the central bank need not hold large amounts of cash in reserve to defend the currency, proposing that the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) be established to invest excess reserves. At the time, it was unprecedented for a non-commodity-based economy to have such a sovereign wealth fund. The foreign merchant bank, Rothschild, advised on the GIC.

====Defence Science Organisation (DSO)====
In 1971, Goh put together the Electronic Warfare Study Group, a team of newly-graduated engineers who had excelled in their university studies that was headed by Tay Eng Soon, then a university lecturer. The group worked on Project Magpie, a secret project to develop Singapore&#x27;s defence technology capabilities. In 1977, the group was renamed the Defence Science Organisation (DSO). Originally part of the Ministry of Defence, the organisation became a non-profit corporation called DSO National Laboratories in 1997.

====Cultural, sports and recreational====
Goh was also responsible for projects that sought to improve Singaporeans&#x27; cultural and leisure life, such as the Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. 

He backed the construction of the Kreta Ayer People&#x27;s Theatre in his constituency as a venue for Chinese opera performances. In 1968, Goh encouraged the establishment of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.

Goh was also instrumental in introducing rugby in the Singapore Armed Forces and later in schools. In recognition of his role in promoting the sport, the Schools &quot;C&quot; Division Cup is named after him. 

Impressed by an oceanarium in the Bahamas, he contacted the Sentosa Development Corporation and persuaded them to build an oceanarium in Singapore. Underwater World opened in 1991.

==Personal life==

In 1986, Goh divorced his first wife Alice. In 1991, he remarried his former Ministry of Education colleague Phua Swee Liang.

Goh suffered his first stroke in 1999, and a subsequent one in 2000 which affected the vision in his right eye. According to Goh&#x27;s daughter-in-law Tan Siok Sun, the medical condition caused him to be withdrawn and became introverted. In July 2007, Tan published a biography titled &quot;Goh Keng Swee: A Portrait&quot;. Goh&#x27;s second wife issued a statement claiming that Goh had not been consulted on the book and had indicated to her that he did not want any book to be written about him. &quot;Therefore, the publication of this book is contrary to his wishes, and is a show of disregard and utmost disrespect to him.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, Tan said she did not start the dispute between Mrs. Goh and herself, nor did she wish to prolong it.

After retirement from politics, Goh continued to be active in public life, serving as Deputy Chairman of GIC between 1981 and 1994, Economic Adviser to the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on Coastal Development and Adviser on Tourism in 1985, Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore between 1985 and 1992, Chairman of the Singapore Totalisator Board between 1988 and 1990, Director of Gateway Technologies Services Pte. Ltd. from 1991 onward, Adviser to the United Overseas Bank Group from 1993 onward, Chairman of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons (Singapore) Ltd. from 1994 onward, and Vice-Chairman of Hong Leong Asia Ltd. from 1995 onward. 

Goh was also Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Institute of East Asian Philosophies between 1983 and 1992, which was founded to study Confucianism. The institute later turned its focus on China&#x27;s political and economic development, renaming itself the Institute of East Asian Political Economy, and Goh continued as Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Governors until 1995. In April 1997, the institute was reconstituted as the East Asian Institute, an autonomous research organisation under the auspices of the National University of Singapore.

==Death==
On 14 May 2010, Goh died in the early morning at his home in Dunbar Walk off East Coast Road in Siglap, at the age of 91. 

His body lay in state at Parliament House from 20 to 22 May, and there was a state funeral on 23 May 2010 at the Singapore Conference Hall followed by a private ceremony for family members at the Mandai Crematorium. 

The latter was conducted by the pastor-in-charge of Barker Road Methodist Church, with a message delivered by the Bishop of the Methodist Church in Singapore, Robert M. Solomon. As a mark of respect, State flags at all Government buildings were flown at half-mast from 20 to 23 May.

==Honours==
In 1966, Goh was made an Honorary Fellow of the London school of Economics. In 1972, he was the recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Services, which is often regarded as &quot;Asia&#x27;s Nobel Prize&quot;. It is awarded to people who have demonstrated integrity in government, courageous service to the people, and pragmatic idealism within a democratic society. That same year, the Philippine Government conferred upon him the Order of Sikatuna, which is given to diplomats, officials and nationals of foreign states who have rendered conspicuous services in fostering, developing and strengthening relations between their country and the Philippines.

Following his retirement from politics, in 1985 Goh was awarded the Order of Temasek (First Class), Singapore&#x27;s highest civilian honour. He was also presented with the LSE&#x27;s Distinguished Alumnus Award on 21 January 1989, and made the first Distinguished Fellow of the Economic Development Board Society in 1991.

During the National Day Rally on 29 August 2010, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the Singapore Command and Staff College, where senior officers of the Singapore Armed Forces receive training; and a complex to be constructed at the Ministry of Education&#x27;s North Buona Vista Road headquarters for specialist teacher training academies in English language, physical education, sports and the arts would be respectively named the Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College and the Goh Keng Swee Centre for Education.

<doc id="575488" wikidata="Q104761999" url="?curid=575488" title="Karaoke Revolution">
<text>Karaoke Revolution and its sequels are music video games for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, GameCube, Wii, Xbox, and Xbox 360, developed by Harmonix and Blitz Games and published by Konami in its Bemani line of music games. The original concept for the game was created by Scott Hawkins and Sneaky Rabbit Studios. Technology and concepts from the game were subsequently incorporated into Harmonix&#x27;s game &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

The Japanese versions of the game are developed by Konami themselves. The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments.

The game does not attempt to understand the singer&#x27;s words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song.

The songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the &quot;SingStar&quot; series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos. However, the 2009 remake of the game (titled &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot;, just like the original) features all master tracks.

==Gameplay==
The player is depicted as a character on-screen performing at a public location. The words to the song scroll bottom to top at the bottom of the screen, above a piano roll representation of the relative pitches at which they are to be sung (the game calls these &quot;note tubes&quot;). At the left end of this area, a &quot;pitch star&quot; shows the pitch which the player is singing and provides feedback on whether they&#x27;re hitting the notes. A &quot;crowd meter&quot; shows the mood of the crowd as the player sings; if they do a good job of hitting notes on-pitch then the crowd will cheer more loudly and clap in rhythm with the song, and the scene will become more vividly animated. If the crowd meter falls all the way to the lowest rating, the audience will boo the character off-stage and the game is over.

Each song is divided into approximately 30 to 50 &quot;phrases&quot;. A meter will fill up and turn from red to green for each phrase, based on how well the player sings the right notes; if the player can fill the meter to green, they will score more points, and getting several greens in a row will create a &quot;combo&quot; and award a 2x score multiplier until the player fails to make green on another phrase. This blue meter resembles how long you should hold the note for and at what pitch. The game can be set at higher difficulties which make this meter larger and require the player to hit the right notes more precisely to fill it to green.

Since maximum scores for each song are normalized 50,000 regardless of difficulty, overall scores on songs can be compared. To achieve the &quot;gold record&quot; for a song, 12,500 points must be achieved. To achieve the &quot;platinum record&quot; for a song, 20,000 points must be achieved. Winning records will unlock additional characters, outfits, and songs. In &quot;Karaoke Revolution Party&quot;, &quot;Karaoke Revolution Country&quot;, &quot;Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol&quot;, and &quot;American Idol Encore&quot;, 50,000 points (a perfect score) earns a &quot;diamond record&quot;. In &quot;Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore 2&quot; the point system was changed so that 60,000 points gives a &quot;platinum record&quot; for a song and 100,000 points is a perfect score (&quot;diamond record&quot;).

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Volume 2&quot; introduces a &quot;medley mode&quot; which challenges the player to sing a string of short clips from various songs.

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Volume 3&quot; introduces &quot;duet mode&quot; which lets two singers play simultaneously. It also revised scoring so that perfect performances result in exactly 50,000 points (with the exception of the Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;ABC&quot;).

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Party&quot; features minigames, support for the EyeToy camera, and a &quot;Sing and Dance&quot; mode which utilizes the dance pad controller.

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol&quot; utilizes American Idol judges, commentary, and stages.

==Releases==
Many expansion discs are available for the Japanese version of the game, including an anime song collection and several volumes of J-Pop.

The North American version of &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; was released in November 2003 on PlayStation 2 version in a bundle with the Logitech headset attachment. The game was sold without the headset in February 2004. The PAL version of the game, titled &quot;Karaoke Stage&quot;, was released in Australia on March 31, 2005, and in Europe on April 22, 2005. &quot;Karaoke Stage 2&quot; contains the same songs as &quot;Karaoke Revolution Party&quot;. The Xbox version was released in November 2004 featuring four more songs that were present in &quot;Karaoke Revolution Volume 2&quot; and 10 exclusive Motown songs which are the original non-cover versions. The Xbox version also supported Xbox Live for downloads of more songs.

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Volume 2&quot; was released in North America on July 13, 2004, on PlayStation 2; &quot;Volume 3&quot; came in November 9 for the same platform.

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Party&quot; was released in North America on November 8, 2005, on PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube. The Xbox version was the only version to feature downloadable songs.

&quot;CMT Presents: Karaoke Revolution Country&quot; was released in North America on March 28, 2006, on PlayStation 2.

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol&quot; was released in North America on January 2, 2007, on PlayStation 2.

* Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, and Ryan Seacrest lent their voices and allowed their names and likenesses to appear in the game, but Paula Abdul did not and was replaced by a judge named Laura who was voiced by voice actress Kenna Kelly.

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore&quot; was released in the North America on PlayStation 2, Wii, and Xbox 360 on February 5, 2008, then to Canadian retailers on February 17, with the PlayStation 3 version released in North American on March 4. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were the only ones that featured downloadable songs, but after May 14, no more new downloadable songs came for either version. New downloadable songs will continue with the sequel, &quot;Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore 2&quot;.

* In addition to Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul&#x27;s name, voice, and likeness appear in this title for the first time. Ryan Seacrest did not return to voice himself as the host. He is replaced with voice actor Johnny Jay.
* The PlayStation 3 version is the only one that had all downloadable songs available on the PlayStation Network marketplace. The Xbox 360 version had six songs discontinued from the Xbox Live marketplace for undisclosed reasons. On November 18, 2008, the downloadable song &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot; became available again in the Xbox Live marketplace.

&quot;Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore 2&quot; was released on November 18, 2008, in the United States on PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. This is the final &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; game to use the &quot;American Idol&quot; likeness and features. Songs downloaded from Xbox Live Marketplace for the first Encore game on Xbox 360 are compatible with &quot;Encore 2&quot;. The previous downloadable songs for the first &quot;Encore&quot; game on PlayStation 3 downloaded from the PlayStation Store would be automatically imported to &quot;Encore 2&quot;. For the first time, Konami has released 5 new downloadable songs that never appeared in any of the previous &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; series before. However, these songs originally appeared from one of Konami&#x27;s other musical game &quot;Rock Revolution&quot;.

In 2009, Konami released a new version for the Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation 3 as a reboot of the franchise. It features enhanced career and multiplayer modes, the ability to record footage for venues with the Xbox Live Vision and PlayStation Eye cameras, and a soundtrack with 50 tracks, all original versions rather than the covers used in previous versions.

Four different microphones were released for the game:
* The original microphone included with the first &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; game is a headset model, and is compatible with the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.
* An updated microphone model was included with future &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; games, and is also used for Karaoke Stage, the European edition, and is compatible with the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. It is a standardized microphone that is also compatible with other games (such as &quot;Rock Band&quot;, &quot;Boogie&quot;, and &quot;High School Musical: Sing It!&quot;).
* An Xbox-compatible microphone was included with versions of &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; for Xbox. It plugs into a memory card/headset port on the controller.
* A GameCube-compatible microphone was included with &quot;Karaoke Revolution Party&quot; for GameCube. It plugs into the memory card slot. It is a standardized microphone that is also compatible with other games (such as &quot;Mario Party 6&quot;).

The SingStar microphones are not compatible with &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; but, unofficially, the &quot;SingStar&quot; microphones works on the PlayStation version of the game.

<doc id="575489" wikidata="Q527546" url="?curid=575489" title="Pooram">
<text>Pooram pronounced is an annual festival, which is celebrated in temples dedicated to goddesses Durga or Kali, held especially in the old Valluvanad area, and to a lesser extent in other places, covering Kerala State&#x27;s present-day Palakkad, Thrissur and Malappuram districts) as also Kollam district, after the summer harvest. Harimattom pooram is one of the famous pooram in Ernakulam. An example of a famous pooram is Thirumandhamkunnu Pooram which has an active participation of 11 Lakh people across the country. Most pooram festivals have at least one ornately decorated elephant being paraded in the procession taken out of the temple precincts. However, there are some well known poorams, such as Anthimahakalankavu Vela, Chelakkara, Aryankavu Pooram at shoranur Palakkad and Machad mamangam near Wadakkanchery that do not use the caparisoned elephant, instead go for stilted mannequins of horses or bullocks. Vela is also a festival like pooram. Thrissur Pooram is the most famous of all poorams, known for fire works. The second-best-known Pooram in Kerala is Kollam Pooram. Kavassery pooram is well known for fireworks during afternoon. Some other well-known pooram festivals are Arattupuzha-Peruvanam Pooram, Chalissery Pooram is well known for the art and cultural standards, Anthimahakalankavu Vela, Nenmara Vallangi Vela, Vairankode Vela, Chinakathoor pooram, Mannarkkad Pooram, Kavassery Pooram, Pariyanampatta Pooram, Harimattom Pooram and Thirumandhamkunnu Pooram. Peruvanam-Arattupuza pooram is celebrating its 1436th year in 2018.

==Musical ensembles==
A melam is a classical performance of different kind of musical instruments that are unique to Kerala and is something akin to the jazz. The most traditional of all &quot;melam&quot;s is called Pandi Melam which is generally performed outside the temple, during the festival. Another kind of &quot;melam&quot; is called Panchari Melam, which is similar to Pandi Melam going by the kind of instruments, but played inside the temple and following a different rhythmic beat.

Panchavadyam (&quot;pancha&quot; in Sanskrit means five) is another classical musical ensemble performed in Kerala. Here, five different kinds of instruments create a breathtaking and fastmoving percussion performance. The five instruments are Madhalam, Kombu, Edakka, Elathalam and Timila.

Thayambaka is a type of solo chenda performance that developed in the south Indian state of Kerala, in which the main player at the centre improvises rhythmically on the beats of half-a-dozen or a few more chenda and ilathalam players around.

==Other attractions==
Interesting attractions of Pooram can be seen in the Valluvanad and Talappilly region. There is the Harijan Vela or Parayar Vela as well as the Tholpavakoothu, a traditional shadow puppetry show.
Harimattom Temple is situated near Tripunithura. just 7 km from there. The temple festival is started on Malayalam month Medam star UTTRAM. The main highlight of the festival is harimattom pooram which is on the 7th day of the festival. The main attraction of this pooram is kudamattam and famous pandimellam with the presence of most of the famous 10 elephants from Kerala. One of the most important things is the Harimattom pooram and festival is conducting as per keeping the Kerala tradition, beliefs and culture.

<text>Harmonix Music Systems, Inc., doing business as Harmonix, is an American video game developer company based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company was established in May 1995 by Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy. Harmonix is perhaps best known as being the developer of music video games series &quot;Dance Central&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot;, as well as being the original developer and creator of the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series before development moved to Neversoft and Vicarious Visions.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Harmonix was founded on May 10, 1995 by Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy, who met while attending MIT. Egozy was an electrical/computer engineer with an interest in music, while Rigopulos was a music composition major with an interest in programming; both met while working in the MIT Media Lab. After building a computer music generation system that could algorithmically create music on the fly, the two considered how one could use a joystick to control the system, and set up a demonstration of the unit for the Lab, which gained interest from others in the Lab. The two realized that after graduation that they probably couldn&#x27;t pursue such ideas working at any existing companies, so they chose to start their own. The company was built on the premise that the experience of performing music could become accessible to those who would otherwise have trouble learning a traditional instrument.

The company was initially funded with about US$100,000, and for the first five years, had nearly zero revenue. The company&#x27;s earliest product was &quot;The Axe&quot; on PC CD-ROM. &quot;The Axe&quot; enabled consumers to easily perform unique instrumental solos by using a PC joystick. This product only sold about 300 copies, with Rigopulos and Egozy realizing that people, while initially entranced by the game, lost interest after 15 minutes of playing with it. Harmonix then designed &quot;CamJam&quot;, which performed similar functions, this time using simple body gestures to trigger music sequences. CamJam was utilized at Disney theme parks. This led the two to consider approaching entertainment businesses like Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s to include their products, but they soon realized that this would be a year to a year-and-a-half effort, too long for their needs. They then considered the entertainment industry in Japan, which in 1997, was taking off with the introduction of karaoke bars and music video games such as &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;, &quot;Beatmania&quot;, and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. They attempted to sell their CamJam equipment to these entertainment centers but found little interest for it. They came to a realization that games like karaoke were popular not due to personal expression, but because they encouraged players to try to accurately recreate the songs through their actions. These games also focused on bringing musical experiences to gamers through simple, understandable interfaces commonly found in games. With this realization, the two returned to the United States and regrouped their company as a video game developer, though they had to let about 40% of their current staff go.

=== Early titles ===
Harmonix&#x27; first major video game was &quot;Frequency&quot;, with its development funded by Sony Computer Entertainment along with about $2 million in investments in the company. A key factor of Harmonix&#x27; contract with Sony was that it was allowed to keep its intellectual property, which allowed Harmonix to build on the game for its future endeavours. The game&#x27;s development began in 1999, backed by a larger team at Harmonix, many of whom were musicians. Featuring songs by a number of underground electronica artists, &quot;FreQuency&quot; allowed players to perform and remix a variety of music. The game was backed by SCEA Vice President of Product Development, Shuhei Yoshida. Released in 2001 on the PlayStation 2, &quot;FreQuency&quot; was critically acclaimed and won numerous awards, though it failed to become a mainstream success. Harmonix developed a sequel, &quot;Amplitude&quot;, released in 2003. Several changes were made to its predecessor to broaden the game&#x27;s appeal, from gameplay tweaks to a more mainstream soundtrack. And again, &quot;Amplitude&quot; achieved awards, critical praise, and a small cult following, but it was not a financial hit. The two attributed the poor response to the games due in part to the lack of a mainstream soundtrack and that the gameplay was difficult to connect to if one was not playing the game.

After &quot;Amplitude&quot;, Harmonix was approached by Konami to create the &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; franchise. Konami, known for their Bemani line of music games, wanted to distribute their games in the United States, and Harmonix was the only music game developer in the country at the time. Konami was responsible for publishing the &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot; titles, of which Harmonix developed and released three &quot;volumes&quot; between 2003 and 2004. The series was much more successful due to its mainstream music and its marketability.

Also in 2004, Sony Computer Entertainment released the Harmonix project &quot;&quot;. A departure from music games, the title used the PlayStation 2 EyeToy camera peripheral to enable one&#x27;s body to perform as a controller for a futuristic extreme sports game. However, the game was poorly received by critics, despite selling four times as many copies as &quot;FreQuency&quot; or &quot;Amplitude&quot;. These results left Rigopulos and Egozy depressed about the prospects for music games.

At this time, RedOctane, a peripheral manufacturing company that had enjoyed Harmonix&#x27; previous games, approached Harmonix about developing the software for a game that would be based on a guitar-shaped controller, inspired by &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; which was popular in Japan. This relationship led to the creation of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, published by RedOctane in 2005. The game features similar gameplay elements to &quot;FreQuency&quot; and &quot;Amplitude&quot;. &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; uses a guitar-shaped controller designed uniquely for the game. Specifically, the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; controller was designed with five color-coded &quot;fret&quot; buttons and a &quot;strum bar&quot;. &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; became largely successful, both critically and commercially, resulting in the well-received 2006 sequel &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;, also developed by Harmonix.

=== Purchase by Viacom ===
In the early part of 2006, Activision acquired RedOctane, and several publishers became interested in acquiring Harmonix. In September 2006, MTV Networks, a division of media conglomerate Viacom, announced that it was acquiring Harmonix for $175 million. Harmonix&#x27;s last &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; game for RedOctane, &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s&quot;, was released in July 2007, thus fulfilling their contractual obligations with the publisher. Before they left the series, Harmonix had already envisioned expanding the gameplay of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; to multiple instruments, a concept that would eventually lead to &quot;Rock Band&quot; that would develop under MTV. Shortly after the acquisition by MTV in December 2006, the initial discussion between Dhani Harrison, son of George Harrison, and MTV President Van Toffler occurred that would eventually lead to meetings between Harmonix and Apple Corps, Ltd., leading to the creation of &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot;, though this was not publicly revealed until late 2008.

Harmonix released &quot;Rock Band&quot; in November 2007. As Harmonix&#x27;s first game as a part of MTV, &quot;Rock Band&quot; expanded upon the design of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; by incorporating three different peripherals: guitar/bass, microphone, and drums. Harmonix continued to support the game after its initial release by offering a variety of downloadable songs to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 players on a weekly basis. As of March 2013 over 4,000 songs have been made available as downloadable content, with over 100 million songs downloaded.
In October 2008, Harmonix, along with MTV Games, announced an exclusive agreement with Apple Corps, Ltd. to produce a standalone title based on the &quot;Rock Band&quot; premise and featuring the music of The Beatles, to be released late in 2009. &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot; features a visual and musical history of the Beatles, and includes 45 songs from their 1962-69 tenure with EMI, using United Kingdom-released versions of their albums &quot;Please Please Me&quot; through &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The developers have worked with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr to gain input on the game, and were using Giles Martin, son of Sir George Martin who produced most of the Beatles albums, as music director for the game. Harmonix stated, despite building on the &quot;Rock Band&quot; gameplay, this would not be a &quot;Rock Band&quot; branded title, and that the songs would not be available as downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series. The agreement had been in discussion for more than 17 months before the announcement.

In November 2008, Viacom paid Harmonix a $150 million bonus as part of the terms of the company&#x27;s 2006 acquisition. The previous quarter&#x27;s bonus was $150 million. In a 2009 survey of the best places to work in the Boston area, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; ranked Harmonix as the 3rd best workplace overall, and the top mid-size business in its poll.

On 10 December 2009, Harmonix laid off 39 of its employees, primarily in the QA department.

=== Sale by Viacom ===
On November 11, 2010, Viacom stated that it was in talks with potential buyers for Harmonix, having already marked the unit as a discontinued operation to write off a $299 million loss for its 2010 third-quarter earnings statement. Such talks had been in place since September 2010, before the release of either &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; or &quot;Dance Central&quot;. Viacom president and CEO, Philippe Dauman, stated the reason they were selling the company was to refocus Viacom as an entertainment creator, and that &quot;the console games business requires expertise [Viacom doesn&#x27;t] have&quot;. Viacom also recognized that without dedicated resources to support video game development, the company was not able to take advantage of efficiencies the dedicated video game publishers have. Martin Peers of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that Viacom lacked the physical distribution channels that other entertainment companies like Time Warner have, and instead were forced to rely on Electronic Arts to distribute the game and cut into their potential profits. Industry analyst Michael Pachter suggested that while &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; and &quot;Dance Central&quot; would generate significant revenue in 2010 holiday sales, Viacom likely made the move to sell Harmonix while the developers were doing well and in the news. Electronic Arts CEO John Riccitiello, commenting on the potential purchase of Harmonix by his company, called Harmonix a &quot;falling knife&quot; in regards to the diminishing size of the rhythm game market since 2009, and stated that &quot;more people have been cut trying to catch falling knives than have benefited from getting the timing exactly right&quot;. John Drake of Harmonix affirmed that Viacom would continue to support Harmonix until the sale is complete, and the developer would still continue their normal operations for their games which is unaffected by the sale.

In late December 2010, Viacom announced that it had sold Harmonix to Harmonix-SBE Holdings LLC, a holding company for the family office of investor Jason Epstein. Epstein is a senior managing partner at investment firm Columbus Nova, though the buy-out of Harmonix was conducted by Epstein personally, and not Columbus Nova. The terms of the sale were undisclosed, though estimated at $200 million. This sale returned Harmonix to its origins as an independent developer. The resulting sale did not affect present or future support plans for Harmonix&#x27; games; Harmonix retained the intellectual property rights for &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Dance Central&quot; in the sale, allowing Harmonix Music Systems to continue to develop these series. According to Peter Kafka of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, the sale of Harmonix was heavily discounted, possibly as low as fifty dollars, the equivalent of a fire sale and allowing Viacom to claim certain tax benefits; meanwhile, the new independent owners would assume all ongoing liability for Harmonix&#x27; projects, including music licensing fees and unsold inventory. Viacom later affirmed that they received nearly $115 million in tax benefits from the Harmonix sale. Following the purchase, Harmonix underwent a restructuring in February 2011, laying off about 12-15% of the 240-person staff. Shortly after this, Activision announced it was shuttering its &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; division and cancelling planned games for 2011, which many journalists considered to mark the end of the rhythm game genre; Harmonix&#x27;s Director of Communications, John Drake, in response to this closure, called the news &quot;discouraging&quot;, but affirmed that Harmonix would continue to invest itself in further &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Dance Central&quot; developments for the foreseeable future.

While Viacom sought a buyer for Harmonix, shareholders of Harmonix, including founders Rigopulos and Egozy, filed a lawsuit against Viacom, alleging misconduct in providing performance payouts in line with the terms of the purchase of Harmonix by Viacom. Harmonix&#x27; suit contests that while Viacom had paid Harmonix $150 million for success of the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series in 2007, the shareholders are due a substantially larger sum for continued success in 2008, as determined by their proxy, Walter Winshall. Viacom countered the claims, stating that Winshall rejected various offers made by Viacom for the payout. The lawsuit also contends that Viacom has withheld $13 million in payouts from 2007, which Viacom had claimed at the time were to cover potential losses in patent lawsuits that were initiated against Harmonix by Activision and Gibson which have since been settled out of court. Viacom has stated it would &quot;vigorously&quot; defend itself in this lawsuit, and initiated a counter-suit in September 2011, suing Harmonix for $131 million believing the $150 million payout was overcalculated. In late 2011, BDO USA, the contract-assigned arbitrator on the matter, concluded that Viacom owed $383 million to Harmonix in addition to the money already paid out, a total of $708 million when combined with the initial purchase by Viacom and initial $150 million advance payment in 2007. Viacom disputed this figure, claiming that BDO&#x27;s report excluded specific evidence supplied by Viacom.

Of the $383 million owed to Harmonix, Viacom agreed to pay $84 million in part to settle the 2007 payments, leaving the dispute for the 2008 payments in court. In August 2012, the Delaware Court of Chancery dismissed Viacom&#x27;s claims, and ordered the company to pay Harmonix the remaining $299 million, though Viacom stated that it was seeking what further options it had. Viacom appealed the decision, but the previous judgement was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in July 2013.

=== As an independent developer ===
Approximately 6 to 9 months after its sale from Viacom, Harmonix started to grow again, boosted by sales of &quot;Dance Central&quot; which led to the development of its sequel &quot;Dance Central 2&quot; in late 2011. By mid-2011, the company began developing new IP in both the mobile and social game markets, and began rehiring to aid in the development of these games. Continued support of the &quot;Rock Band&quot; franchise has remained a &quot;meaningful source of profitability&quot; to Harmonix through 2011, according to Rigopulos. Bloomberg then projected that Harmonix would post $100 million in profit in 2011, based on sales of &quot;Dance Central&quot; and continued downloadable content for the game.

At the onset of the 2013 E3 conference, Harmonix announced that its next title would be the Kinect-enabled &quot;&quot; produced in association with Disney Interactive. The game is based around the animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, and puts the player in control of music in a manner similar to Harmonix&#x27; previous rhythm games, affecting the virtual environment and interactive objects within it. The game is based on licensed contemporary rock music such as Queen and Bruno Mars.

In February 2014, Harmonix announced a new title, &quot;Chroma&quot;, co-developed with Hidden Path Entertainment, which combines their music genre experience with first-person shooters. The players&#x27; actions are timed to the music in the game, influencing their effect with certain actions like gunfire, grenade explosions, and team healing. &quot;Chroma&quot; was planned for release in late 2014 on Microsoft Windows systems via Steam.

In May 2014, along with about 37 layoffs, Alex Rigopulos stepped aside from CEO to become the company&#x27;s chief creative officer, while Steve Janiak would take over as CEO.

In March 2015, Harmonix announced their plan to return to &quot;Rock Band&quot; with the next major title in the series, &quot;Rock Band 4&quot;. The new title, aimed to support backwards compatibility with all previous songs and instrument hardware, was aimed to be more of a platform for the eighth-generation consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as they have no plans to release another standalone title during this console generation but would continually provide free and paid features and content updates throughout its lifetime. Harmonix had $15 million in investor funding from Spark Capital and Foundry Group to support &quot;Rock Band 4&quot;, &quot;Amplitude&quot; and additional projects going forward including virtual reality-based games.

In September 2015, Rigopulos announced that he would go to the advisory board for the crowdfunding site Fig, through which Harmonix would obtain funding for its next, yet-announced game. On 1 March 2016, Harmonix confirmed that the campaign was indeed to raise funds to port &quot;Rock Band 4&quot; to the PC, but gamers would only have until 5 April to pledge US$1.5 million to make it happen. The campaign was unsuccessful raising a total of $792,817.

Harmonix and NCSoft announced a publishing deal in August 2018 for an unspecified title developed by Harmonix and published by NCSoft across personal computers and console systems. This was revealed in February 2020 as &quot;Fuser&quot;, a DJ-inspired title to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in late 2020. Players, as a DJ, interactively mix tracks of popular licensed songs alongside specific rules as they appear on screen.

===Purchase by Epic Games===

Harmonix was acquired by Epic Games in November 2021. Harmonix stated that this would not affect their support for &quot;Rock Band 4&quot; or &quot;Fuser&quot; DLC, though &quot;Fuser&quot; was discontinued in 2022. The company also stated it would develop &quot;musical journeys and gameplay for &quot;Fortnite&quot;&quot; in addition to making musical projects in the metaverse. This ultimately culminated in the release of &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; on December 9, 2023. &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; follows a similar approach to &quot;Rock Band&quot;, allowing players to match notes to popular songs, while also offering a &quot;jam&quot; mode that allows players to mix parts from different songs, as in &quot;Dropmix&quot; or &quot;Fuser&quot;. According to Rigopulos, the company plans to treat &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; as a live-service musical experience for &quot;Fortnite&quot;. He also confirmed plans for instrument controller support, describing it as &quot;very much a priority&quot; for the team. On January 17, 2024, Harmonix announced that they would discontinue &quot;Rock Band 4&quot; DLC, with the final DLC pack released on January 25, 2024. The company noted that &quot;if you are a fan of the rhythm game category, &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; is the place to be&quot;.

<doc id="575495" wikidata="Q3291230" url="?curid=575495" title="Hide (skin)">
<text>A hide or skin is an animal skin treated for human use. 
The word &quot;hide&quot; is related to the German word , which means skin. The industry defines hides as &quot;skins&quot; of large animals &quot;e.g&quot;. cow, buffalo; while skins refer to &quot;skins&quot; of smaller animals: goat, sheep, deer, pig, fish, alligator, snake, etc.
Common commercial hides include leather from cattle and other livestock animals, buckskin, alligator skin and snake skin. All are used for shoes, clothes, leather bags, belts, or other fashion accessories. Leather is also used in cars, upholstery, interior decorating, horse tack and harnesses. Skins are sometimes still gathered from hunting and processed at a domestic or artisanal level but most leather making is now industrialized and large-scale. Various tannins are used for this purpose. Hides are also used as processed chews for dogs or other pets.

The term &quot;skin&quot; is sometimes expanded to include furs, which are harvested from various species, including cats, mustelids, and bears.

== History ==
Archaeologists believe that animal hides provided an important source of clothing and shelter for all prehistoric humans and their use continued among non-agricultural societies into modern times. The Inuit, for example, used animal hides for summer tents, waterproof clothes, and kayaks. In early medieval ages hides were used to protect wooden castles and defense buildings from setting alight during a siege. Various American Indian tribes used hides in the construction of tepees and wigwams, moccasins, and buckskins. They were sometimes used as window coverings. Until the invention of plastic drum heads in the 1950s, animal hides or metal was used.

Parchment and vellum—a kind of paper made from processed skins—was introduced to the Eastern Mediterranean during the Iron Age, supposedly at Pergamon.

The Assize of Weights and Measures—one of the statutes of uncertain date from —mentions rawhide, gloves, parchment, and vellum among the principal items of England&#x27;s commerce. A standardized shipload of leather (a last) consisted of 20 dicker of 10 cowhides. Rabbit and squirrel skins were traded and taxed in timbers of 40 hides each. Skins were also traded in binds of 32 or 33 skins each, while gloves were sold in dickers of 10 pair and dozens of 12 pair. The parchment and vellum was traded based on dozens of the original sheepskins from which they were prepared.

Rare furs have been a notable status symbol throughout history. Ermine fur was particularly associated with European nobility, with the black-tipped tails arranged around the edges of the robes to produce a pattern of black diamonds on a white field. Demand for beaver hats in the 17th and 18th century drove some of the initial exploration of North America, particularly in Canada, and even prompted wars among native tribes competing for the most productive areas. Natural leather continues to be used for many expensive products from limousine upholstery to designer cellular phone cases. There are, however, many forms of artificial leather and fur now available, which are usually cheaper alternatives.

==Production==
Animal hides and skins are usually processed fresh or salted and tanned. Skins sometimes are stretched, dried, and tanned. Most hides are processed from domesticated animals; the most common wild animals used for fur—mink and rabbit—are similarly raised in captivity and farmed. Some others—including lynx and wolves—are still trapped in the wild for their fur.

==Use==
Currently, hides are mainly used for footwear, upholstery, leather goods; skins are used for clothing, particularly as coats, gloves, leather goods and footwear. It is also used for bookbinding.

Many traditional drums, especially hand drums like the pandeiro, continue to be made using natural skins. The alligator drum was formerly important in Chinese music. The Chinese sanxian and Okinawan sanshin are usually prepared from snakeskin, while their Japanese equivalent, the shamisen, is made from dogskin in the case of students and catskin in the case of professional players. The African-American banjo was originally made from skins but is now often synthetic. &quot;Hides&quot; is used as a slang term to refer to a drumset.

Kangaroo leather is the most common material for the construction of bullwhips. Stingray rawhide is a common material for the grips of Chinese, Japanese, and Scottish swords.

Pig skins are processed as pork rinds.

Rabbit fur is popular for hats, coats, and glove linings.

==Controversy==
Animal rights activists generally protest the use of animal hides for human clothing. Forms of protest range from PETA&#x27;s &quot;I would rather go naked than wear fur&quot; campaign, although more shocking and direct action, like damaging furs with red paint in imitation of blood, has been toned down, like the &quot;Ink, not Mink&quot; campaign.
Roadblocking and break-ins against meat/fur/leather industry is also used and extends to personal campaigns against such companies and also hunters which have included arson and assault in some cases.

<text>Paul Ehrenberg (1876–1949) was a German violinist and impressionist painter, brother of Carl Ehrenberg and half-brother of Hilde Distel.

Ehrenberg was a student of the painter Heinrich von Zügel. He was a member of the Luitpoldsgruppe and Künstlergenossenschaft. His work, shown in many Munich exhibitions, included portraits, still lifes, landscapes, and animal paintings. He married the painter Lilly Teufel.

Ehrenberg was an excellent violinist, who often played chamber music with Thomas Mann. Based on the evidence of Thomas Mann&#x27;s letters and diaries, Mann was infatuated with Ehrenberg, and they had an intense personal relationship from 1899 to about 1903. Mann based several characters in his published writings on him.

<doc id="575500" wikidata="Q541659" url="?curid=575500" title="Paul Chambers">
<text>Paul Laurence Dunbar Chambers Jr. (April 22, 1935 – January 4, 1969) was an American jazz double bassist. A fixture of rhythm sections during the 1950s and 1960s, he has become one of the most widely-known jazz bassists of the hard bop era. He was also known for his bowed solos. Chambers recorded about a dozen albums as a leader or co-leader, and over 100 more as a sideman, especially as the anchor of trumpeter Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;first great quintet&quot; (1955–63) and with pianist Wynton Kelly (1963–68).

==Biography==
Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 22, 1935, to Paul Lawrence Chambers and Margaret Echos, he was brought up in Detroit, Michigan, following the death of his mother. He began playing music with several of his schoolmates on the baritone horn. Later he took up the tuba. 
&quot;I got along pretty well, but it&#x27;s quite a job to carry it around in those long parades, and I didn&#x27;t like the instrument that much&quot;.

==Bass playing==
Chambers switched to the double bass around 1949. His formal bass training began in earnest in 1952, when he began taking private lessons with Gaston Brohan, principal bassist of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Chambers did some classical playing himself, with a rehearsal group called the Detroit String Band. He studied at Cass Technical High School intermittently from 1952 to 1955, and played in Cass&#x27; symphony, and in various other student groups, in one of which he played baritone saxophone.

When he left for New York City at the invitation of tenor saxophonist Paul Quinichette, he had a working knowledge of many instruments.
Jazz bass players were largely limited to timekeeping with drums, until Duke Ellington&#x27;s bassist Jimmy Blanton began a transformation in the instrument&#x27;s role at the end of the 1930s. Chambers was about 15 years old when he started to listen to Charlie Parker and Bud Powell, his first jazz influences. Oscar Pettiford and Ray Brown were the first bassists he admired, and these were followed by Percy Heath, Milt Hinton and Wendell Marshall for their rhythm section work, and Charles Mingus and George Duvivier for their technical prowess and for their efforts in broadening the scope of jazz bass. Blanton was his all-time favorite.

==First performance on bass==
From 1954 on through 1955, he gained significance touring with such musicians as Bennie Green, Quinichette, George Wallington, J. J. Johnson and Kai Winding. In 1955, he joined the Miles Davis quintet, and he was awarded the &quot;DownBeat&quot; &quot;New Star Award&quot; the following year. Chambers stayed with the group until 1963, and he appeared on many classic albums, including &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. One of Chambers&#x27; most noted performances was on that album&#x27;s first track, &quot;So What&quot;, which opens with a brief duet featuring Chambers and pianist Bill Evans. From 1963 until 1968, Chambers played with Wynton Kelly&#x27;s trio. He freelanced frequently as a sideman for many others throughout his career.

==Personal life==
Chambers developed addictions to both alcohol and heroin. He was hospitalized at the end of 1968 with what was thought to be a severe case of influenza, but tests revealed that he had tuberculosis. As his organ functions deteriorated, Chambers lapsed into a coma for 18 days. It is believed his addictions to heroin and alcohol contributed to his health problems. On January 4, 1969, he died of tuberculosis aged 33.

==Influence==
From his role in the Davis band, Chambers was the bassist in two rhythm sections. The first, with Red Garland on piano and Philly Joe Jones on drums, came to be known as &quot;the rhythm section&quot;, that name featured on a celebrated album by saxophonist Art Pepper, &quot;Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section&quot;. The second, with Wynton Kelly and Jimmy Cobb, made many sessions as a unit, recording albums with John Coltrane, Wes Montgomery, and by themselves under Kelly&#x27;s name on albums such as &quot;Kelly Blue&quot;.

Paul Chambers was in great demand as a session musician, and played on numerous albums during the period he was active including such landmarks as Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot;, Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, and Oliver Nelson&#x27;s &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot;. Many musicians wrote songs dedicated to Chambers. Red Garland wrote the tune &quot;The P.C. Blues&quot;, and Coltrane&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. P.C.&quot; is named after Chambers. Tommy Flanagan wrote &quot;Big Paul&quot;, which was performed on the Kenny Burrell and John Coltrane Prestige 1958 LP. Max Roach wrote a drum solo called &quot;Five For Paul&quot;, on a 1977 drum solo LP recorded in Japan, and Sonny Rollins wrote &quot;Paul&#x27;s Pal&quot; for him as well. In the world of alternative rock, Barenaked Ladies bass player Jim Creeggan wrote the song &quot;Paul Chambers&quot; for their 2021 album &quot;Detour de Force&quot;.

In an interview, fellow bassist Charlie Haden recalled his admiration for Chambers:

<text>The City of Brussels is the largest municipality and historical centre of the Brussels-Capital Region, as well as the capital of the French Community of Belgium, the Flemish Region (from which it is separate) and Belgium. The City of Brussels is also the administrative centre of the European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions in its European Quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;12010E/PRO/06&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the central historic town located within the Pentagon, the City of Brussels covers some of the city&#x27;s immediate outskirts within the greater Brussels-Capital Region, namely the former municipalities of Haren, Laeken, and Neder-Over-Heembeek to the north, as well as the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan and the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos park to the south-east, where it borders municipalities in Flanders.

, the City of Brussels had a population of 196,828 inhabitants. The total area is , which gives a population density of . , there were 75,998 registered non-Belgians in the City. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

==Territorial history==
Historically, the City of Brussels was simply defined, being the area within the second walls of Brussels, the modern-day Small Ring (Brussels&#x27; inner ring road). As the city grew, so did the surrounding villages, eventually forming a contiguous city, though the local governments retained control of their respective areas.

At the country&#x27;s independence in 1830, the new members of the Belgian upper class hoped to create a new prestigious residential area in the capital. An official plan for the Leopold Quarter was drawn up in 1838, marking the first major extension of the City of Brussels in its eastern part, following the transfer of a large area of the municipality of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. The area was designed to emanate from Brussels Park (located in front of the Royal Palace), and was laid out on a grid in a traditional classical pattern centred around the /.

Shortly afterwards, in 1844, the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan was proposed as a monumental avenue bordered by chestnut trees that would allow easy access from Brussels&#x27; city centre to the popular recreational area of the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos. However, fierce resistance to the project was put up by the towns of Saint-Gilles and Ixelles—then, as now, separate municipalities (local authorities) from the City of Brussels—through whose territories the avenue was to run. After years of fruitless negotiations, the City of Brussels finally annexed the narrow band of land needed for the avenue, in addition to the Bois de la Cambre itself, in April 1864. That decision accounts for the unusual shape of today&#x27;s City of Brussels and for the separation of Ixelles into two separate areas.

To the east, in 1853, following the bankruptcy of Saint-Josse&#x27;s municipal administration, the City of Brussels purchased half of this municipality. Nowadays, this is the Squares Quarter, the only part of the Brussels municipality to have the same postal code (1040) as the municipality of Etterbeek. Further east, in 1880, a former military exercise ground and the surrounding land, also located in Etterbeek, were attached to the City to create the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark, an exhibition space commemorating the 50th anniversary of independence. A leisure park and museums were subsequently set up there.

Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones now located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975. However, a few neighbouring municipalities have been merged into the City of Brussels, including Haren, Laeken and Neder-Over-Heembeek in 1921. These comprise the northern bulge in the municipality. To the south-east is the above-mentioned strip of land along the Avenue Louise that was annexed from Saint-Gilles and Ixelles. Part of the (ULB)&#x27;s Solbosch campus is also part of the City of Brussels, partially accounting for the bulge in the south-eastern end.

==Demographics==

===Historical population===
, the City of Brussels&#x27; population was 196,828 inhabitants. The area is , making the density .

Taking into account the current municipality, including the former municipalities annexed in 1921 (Haren, Laeken and Neder-over-Heembeek) from 1831:

===Foreign population===
The City of Brussels has a large immigrant population, with both the EU and non-European migrant communities outnumbering the native Belgians. Akin to neighbouring Ixelles, Etterbeek and Schaerbeek, the City of Brussels also has a large Muslim population, mainly of North African origin.

, taking into account the nationality of birth of the parents, 55.84% of the City of Brussels&#x27;s population is of non-European origin (predominantly Moroccan, Indian and Congolese), 27.21% is of European origin other than Belgian (mainly French, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, and Polish), while 16.94% is solely of native Belgian ancestry. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.

Migrant communities in the City of Brussels with over 1,000 people as of 1 January 2020:

==Politics==
As in every other Belgian municipality, the City of Brussels is headed by a mayor, who should not be confused with the Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region or the Governor of Brussels-Capital. The current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections. The current mayor of the City of Brussels is Philippe Close, a member of PS, who is in coalition on the municipal council with Ecolo - Groen, DéFI and Forward.

===Environmental policy===
Brussels is ranked sixth in the index of cities which are becoming greener fastest as for the year 2022, even though in the past it had a reputation of a &quot;traffic-choked city of high rises and concrete&quot;. The authorities released a plan composed of seven steps on how to make the city even more sustainable. Those include introducing &quot;a use-based, circular and low-carbon economy&quot; and making the city &quot;proactive&quot;. The city should become a &quot;10-minute city&quot; meaning &quot;making the facilities essential to urban life accessible to every inhabitant in less than 10 minutes&quot;. Green spaces should be expanded. The plan includes participation of the population in decision-making and high life level for all.

==Culture==

===Museums===
There are many museums in and around Brussels&#x27; city centre. On the first Sunday of every month, free entry is granted to many of Brussels&#x27; museums.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of museums in the City of Brussels:
* Royal Museums of Art and History :
** Art &amp; History Museum
** Horta-Lambeaux Pavilion
** Halle Gate
** Museums of the Far East
** Musical Instruments Museum
* Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium :
** Oldmasters Museum
** Magritte Museum
** Fin-de-Siècle Museum
** Wiertz Museum
** Meunier Museum
** Royal Museum of Modern Art
* Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History

===Food===
Brussels is well known for its food. Brussels sprouts were named after the city. Like most of Belgium, &quot;moules-frites&quot;, waffles (gaufres), chocolate, French fries, and beer are common there. It is home to one 2-starred and four 1-starred Michelin restaurants.

<text>The MYH16 gene encodes a protein called myosin heavy chain 16, which is a muscle protein in mammals. At least in primates, it is a specialized muscle protein found only in the temporalis and masseter muscles of the jaw. Myosin heavy chain proteins are important in muscle contraction, and if they are missing, the muscles will be smaller. In non-human primates, MYH16 is functional and the animals have powerful jaw muscles. In humans, the MYH16 gene has a mutation that causes the protein not to function. Although the exact importance of this change in accounting for differences between humans and other apes is not yet clear, such a change may be related to increased brain size and finer control of the jaw, which facilitates speech. It is not clear how the MYH16 mutation relates to other changes to the jaw and skull in early human evolution (for example, whether the MYH16 mutation happened first and led to other changes, or whether the MYH16 mutation happened after other changes made the MYH16 protein no longer necessary).

The initial discovery of the human MYH16 mutation was published in 2004 by a team at the University of Pennsylvania led by Hansell H. Stedman. The date of the mutation has variously been estimated at 2.4 million years ago or 5.3 million years ago.

The MYH16 gene is present in dogs, but does not appear to be present in mice.

<doc id="575506" wikidata="Q679979" url="?curid=575506" title="Gelati Monastery">
<text>Gelati () is a medieval monastic complex near Kutaisi in the Imereti region of western Georgia. One of the first monasteries in Georgia, it was founded in 1106 by King David IV of Georgia as a monastic and educational center. 

The monastery is an exemplar of the Georgian Golden Age and a gold aesthetic is employed in the paintings and buildings. It was built to celebrate the Orthodox Christian faith in Georgia; some murals found inside the Gelati Monastery church date back to the 12th century. The monastery was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 because of its outstanding architecture and its importance as an educational and scientific center in medieval Georgia.

==Overview and description==
The monastery is located on a hill several kilometers to the northeast of Kutaisi. It also overlooks the Tskaltsitela Gorge. It is constructed of solid stone, with full archways. The plan of the main monastery was designed in the shape of a cross, the symbol of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion and of Christianity. The monastery was designed to be visible over much of the country, with its stone walls constructed to reflect sunlight. There are archways throughout the monastery, including the bell tower.

==History==
Construction began on the Gelati Monastery in 1106, under the direction of King David IV of Georgia, at which time Kutaisi was the capital of Georgia. It was constructed during the reign of the Byzantine Empire; in this period Christianity was the ruling religion throughout the empire. The monastery&#x27;s main church, known as the Church of the Blessed Virgin, was completed in 1130, under the reign of David IV&#x27;s successor, Demetrius I of Georgia, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The monastery is also the burial site of King David IV, near which the Ancient Gates of Ganja, which were taken by King Demetrius I in 1138, can be found. The smaller chapels within the monastery date to the 13th century. 

In addition to its religious purpose, the monastery was also constructed to function as an academy of science and education in Georgia: King David IV employed many Georgian scientists, theologians, and philosophers, many of whom had previously been active at various Orthodox monasteries abroad, such as the Mangana Monastery in Constantinople. Among its notable scholars were Ioane Petritsi, who translated several classics of philosophy but is best known for his commentaries on Proclus; and Arsen Ikaltoeli, known for his &quot;Dogmatikon&quot;, or book of teachings, influenced by Aristotle. The Gelati Academy employed scribes to compile manuscript copies of important works, and people of the time called it &quot;a new Hellas&quot; and &quot;a second Athos&quot;.

==Art==
===Triptychs===
Triptychs were popular during the Byzantine Empire and important in Georgian culture. The triptychs represented another form of contribution to the church. Triptychs were a form of iconography for the congregation.

One of the most valuable icons housed in the monastery was the Khakhuli triptych, which was enshrined in the Gelati Monastery from the 12th century until being stolen in 1859. Although returned in 1923, it was in a reduced condition.

===Mosaics===
The interiors of the monastery hold mosaics in classic Byzantine style illustrating aspects of Christian belief. The largest, a 12th-century masterpiece depicting the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus, dominates the apse of the main church, and is an artwork of cultural importance in Georgia. Above the altar is situated a statue of the Virgin Mary, looking down at the baby Jesus she is holding.

==Conservation==
The monastery is still active and its churches continue to be regularly used for religious service. Under the supervision of UNESCO the site is being continually restored and protected. All the original structures of the monastery are intact and functional.

The mosaics and murals were damaged prior to UNESCO conservation, but halted when the roof of the academy building was replaced by Georgian conservators. By presidential decree, the monastery was added to the National Register of Monuments for protection and restoration in 2006.

<text>Half-Life 2 is a 2004 first-person shooter (FPS) game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It was published for Windows on Valve&#x27;s digital distribution service, Steam. Like the original &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; is played entirely from a first-person perspective, combining combat, puzzles, and storytelling. It adds features such as vehicles and physics-based gameplay. The player controls Gordon Freeman, who joins a resistance to liberate Earth from the Combine, a multidimensional alien empire.

&quot;Half-Life 2&quot; was created using Valve&#x27;s Source game engine, which was developed simultaneously. Development lasted five years and cost US$40million. Valve&#x27;s president, Gabe Newell, set his team the goal of redefining the FPS genre. They integrated the Havok physics engine, which simulates real-world physics, to reinforce the sense of presence and create new gameplay. They also developed the characterisation, with more detailed character models and animations. 

Valve announced &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; at E3 2003 with a release date of September of that year. They failed to meet the release date, leading to fan backlash. In October, the unfinished source code was published online, leading to more backlash and damage to the team&#x27;s morale.

&quot;Half-Life 2&quot; was released on Steam on November 16, 2004. It won 39 Game of the Year awards and, like its predecessor, has been cited as one of the most influential FPS games and among the best games ever made. It was ported to the Xbox, the Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3, macOS, and Linux. By 2011, it had sold 12 million copies. &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; was followed by the free extra level &quot;Lost Coast&quot; (2005) and the episodic sequels &quot;Episode One&quot; (2006) and &quot;Episode Two&quot; (2007). In 2020, after canceling &quot;Episode Three&quot; and several further &quot;Half-Life&quot; projects, Valve released a prequel, &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
Like the original &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; is a single-player first-person shooter (FPS) in which players control Gordon Freeman. It features combat, exploration, jumping challenges, and puzzle-solving, and narrative elements conveyed through scripted sequences. Weapons include a pistol, submachine gun, shotgun, and the powerful Combine pulse rifle. With the pheromone item, enemy antlions become allies and can be called to the player or sent to attack enemies.

&quot;Half-Life 2&quot; introduces detailed physics simulation. With the new gravity gun, players can repel objects or pull them from a distance. For example, objects can be fired at enemies, held as shields, or placed to reach new areas, and enemy grenades can be caught and thrown back. The player must also use physics to solve puzzles. &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; also adds vehicle sections in which the player controls an airboat and a dune buggy.

== Plot ==

After the alien invasion at the Black Mesa Research Facility, a multidimensional alien empire known as the Combine has conquered Earth. Approximately twenty years after being placed in stasis, Gordon Freeman is inserted into a train bound for City 17 by the G-Man (Michael Shapiro). Helped by the undercover Resistance member Barney Calhoun (Shapiro), Gordon attempts to reach the laboratory of Dr. Isaac Kleiner (Harry S. Robins) but is subdued by Combine officers. He is rescued by Alyx Vance (Merle Dandridge), who guides him to the laboratory. Kleiner&#x27;s attempt to teleport Gordon to the Resistance base fails, and Gordon is momentarily teleported to the Citadel, the skyscraper headquarters of Dr. Wallace Breen (Robert Culp), the former Black Mesa administrator and the Combine&#x27;s puppet ruler. Gordon progresses to the base using the city&#x27;s canal system using an airboat, eluding Combine forces.

At the base, Gordon reunites with Alyx&#x27;s father, Dr. Eli Vance (Robert Guillaume), and meets Dr. Judith Mossman (Michelle Forbes). Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot, Dog, and gives Gordon the gravity gun. Combine forces storm the base and capture Eli and Mossman. Gordon diverts through the zombie-infested town of Ravenholm, aided by its lone inhabitant, Father Grigori (Jim French), to a Resistance outpost whose occupants provide him with a dune buggy. He drives along the coastline of depleted water levels to reach the Combine prison of Nova Prospekt, where Eli and Mossman are being held. Gordon and Alyx reunite, locate Eli, and discover that Mossman is a Combine spy. Before they can stop her, Mossman teleports herself and Eli to the Citadel. The teleporter explodes moments after Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt.

Returning to Kleiner&#x27;s lab, Gordon and Alyx learn that the teleporter malfunctioned and that a week has passed, during which time the Resistance has used the attack on Nova Prospekt to launch an armed rebellion against the Combine. Aided by Barney and Dog, Gordon fights his way to the Citadel. Inside, a security system vaporizes his weapons but inadvertently super-charges the gravity gun; this helps Gordon climb the tower. He is captured and taken in a transport pod to Breen&#x27;s private office, near the Citadel&#x27;s apex, where he and Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx as captives. Breen reveals that he plans to use them as leverage to negotiate with the Combine, contradicting what he had told Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees the captives and Breen attempts to escape using a teleporter. Gordon destroys the reactor and Breen falls into the abyss. Moments after the reactor explodes, the G-Man reappears and freezes time, praises Gordon&#x27;s actions, and returns him to stasis.

== Development ==
Development of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; began in June 1999, six months after the release of the original &quot;Half-Life&quot;. It was developed by a team of 82, or around 100 people including voice actors. Valve&#x27;s president, Gabe Newell, wanted to redefine the FPS genre, saying: &quot;Why spend four years of your life building something that isn&#x27;t innovative and is basically pointless? If &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; isn&#x27;t viewed as the best PC game of all time, it&#x27;s going to completely bum out most of the guys on this team.&quot; Newell gave his team no deadline and a &quot;virtually unlimited&quot; budget, promising to fund the project himself if necessary. They used Valve&#x27;s new in-house game engine, Source, developed simultaneously.

=== Setting and characters ===
Whereas &quot;Half-Life&quot; was set in a single location, the Black Mesa research facility, Valve wanted &quot;a much more epic and global feel&quot; for the sequel. One concept had the player teleporting between planets, which was discarded as it would make continuity between levels difficult. At the suggestion of the art director, Viktor Antonov, who was Bulgarian, the team settled on a city in an Eastern European location. In this early concept, players would start the game by boarding the &quot;Borealis&quot;, an icebreaker bound for the city. Nova Prospekt was conceived as a small rail depot built on an old prison in the wasteland and grew from a stopping-off point to the destination itself.

After observing how players had connected to minor characters in &quot;Half-Life&quot;, the team developed the characterization, with more detailed character models and realistic animation. The animator Ken Birdwell studied the work of the psychologist Paul Ekman, who had researched how facial muscles express emotion. The writer Marc Laidlaw created family relationships between the characters, saying that it was a &quot;basic dramatic unit everyone understands&quot; but rarely used in games. The voice cast included Louis Gossett Jr., Robert Guillaume and Robert Culp.

=== Physics and design ===

Valve integrated the Havok physics engine, which simulates real-world physics, to reinforce the player&#x27;s sense of presence and create new gameplay. To experiment, they created a minigame, Zombie Basketball, in which players used a physics-manipulating gun to throw zombies through hoops. In mid-2000, to test the physics and non-player characters, Valve built a battle between rioting citizens and police.

In late 2001, Valve began creating a showreel, hoping to demonstrate it at E3 the next year. For several months, Newell let the team work without his input so he could provide unbiased feedback, and focused on developing Steam, Valve&#x27;s upcoming digital distribution service. The team presented the showreel to Newell, showcasing physics, environments such as the &quot;Borealis&quot;, and a dialogue-heavy scene with the scientist character Dr. Kleiner. Newell felt the showreel did not adequately show how the physics would affect gameplay and that the Kleiner scene was overlong. Reflecting on the feedback, Laidlaw concluded that the character drama had to support interactivity and gameplay.

In September 2002, the team completed a second showreel, featuring a buggy race along the City 17 coast, an encounter with headcrabs on a pier, an alien strider attacking the city, and a greatly shortened Kleiner sequence. In October, Newell told the team they would announce &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; at E3 2003 and release it by the end of the year. As with the original &quot;Half-Life&quot;, the team split into &quot;cabals&quot; working on different levels. Designers created levels using placeholder shapes and surfaces, which then were worked on by the artists.

=== Announcement and delay ===
Valve announced &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; at E3 2003, with demonstrations of the characters, animation and physics. The reaction was positive, and the game won the E3 Game of the Show award. Newell also announced a release date of September 30, 2003, hoping this would motivate the team. They worked long hours to meet the deadline, but by July it was clear they would miss it. Rumors spread of a delay. On September 23, Valve released a statement targeting a release for the holiday season, leading to fan backlash.

Newell had been hesitant to announce a delay without a new release date. He said later: &quot;We were paralyzed. We knew we weren&#x27;t going to make the date we promised, and that was going to be a huge fiasco and really embarrassing. But we didn&#x27;t have a new date to give people either.&quot; The graphics card manufacturer ATI had arranged a promotional event on Alcatraz Island to coincide with the planned release of &quot;Half-Life 2.&quot; Unable to pull out of the event, Newell gave a prepared speech, demonstrated the Source engine, and left without addressing questions.

=== Leak ===
On September 19, the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; source code was obtained by a German hacker, Axel Gembe, who had infiltrated Valve&#x27;s internal network months earlier. According to Gembe, he shared it with another person, who leaked the code online in early October. Fans soon compiled a playable version of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, revealing how unfinished it was. The leaks damaged morale at Valve and slowed development. Fans also provided Valve with the details of people involved in the leaks. In March 2004, Gembe contacted Newell, saying he was a fan and had not acted maliciously. Newell worked with the FBI to invite Gembe to a fake job interview, planning to have him arrested in the United States; however, police arrested him in Germany. In November 2006, Gembe was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation. Valve implemented new policies to protect against leaks, such as requiring journalists to attend their office to play it before release.

=== Final months ===
In 2004, the team returned after Christmas to long hours, stressful working conditions, and no guarantee that &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, which was costing $1 million a month to develop, would be finished soon. However, Newell felt that momentum was gathering, with the team producing about three hours of gameplay per month. In March, they created the first version playable from start to finish and stopped development for a week to play through the game. Major changes by this point included the cutting of the &quot;Borealis&quot;, the replacement of the jet ski with a hovercraft, and introducing the physics-manipulating gravity gun earlier in the game. Feedback was positive across the company. Newell recalled: &quot;The fact that you could go from one end of the game to the other was a really big thing for us. Then we knew it just had to get better &quot;–&quot; but it was all there.&quot; After several months of bug fixes and playtesting, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; was completed on October 13, 2004.

== Release ==
Valve made a 1 GB portion of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; available for download in an encrypted format through Steam on August 26, 2004. On the day of release, Steam customers were able to pay, unlock the files, and play the game immediately, without having to wait for the game to download. In retail, distribution of the game was handled by Vivendi Universal Games through their Sierra Entertainment subsidiary.

A demo version with the file size of a single CD was made available in December 2004 at the website of graphics card manufacturer ATI Technologies, who teamed up with Valve for the game. The demo contains a portion of two chapters: &quot;Point Insertion&quot; and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Go To Ravenholm...&quot;. The soundtrack was written by Kelly Bailey. The soundtrack, containing most of the music from &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and many tracks from the original &quot;Half-Life&quot;, was included with the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; &quot;Gold Edition&quot; and sold separately from Valve&#x27;s online store. In 2022, fans discovered that the texture used for a corpse model originated from a photograph of a corpse published in a medical textbook, leading to criticism.

=== Dispute with Vivendi ===
On September 20, 2004, &quot;GameSpot&quot; reported that Sierra&#x27;s parent company, Vivendi Universal Games, was in a legal battle with Valve over the distribution of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; to cyber cafés. Cyber cafés were important for the gaming market in Asia, where PC and broadband penetration per capita were much lower in most territories.

According to Vivendi, the distribution contract they signed with Valve included cyber cafés. This would mean that only Vivendi could distribute &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; to cyber cafés — not Valve through the Steam system. On November 29, 2004, Judge Thomas S. Zilly, of U.S. Federal District Court in Seattle, Washington, ruled that Vivendi and its affiliates are not authorized to distribute (directly or indirectly) Valve games through cyber cafés for pay-to-play activities according to the parties&#x27; current publishing agreement. Zilly also ruled in favor of the Valve motion regarding the contractual limitation of liability, allowing Valve to recover copyright damages for any infringement as allowed by law without regard to the publishing agreement&#x27;s limitation of liability clause.

On April 29, 2005, Valve and Vivendi announced a settlement. Vivendi would cease distributing all retail packaged versions of Valve games by August 31, 2005. Vivendi was also to notify distributors and cyber cafés that had been licensed by Vivendi that only Valve had the authority to distribute cyber café licenses; their licenses were revoked and switched to Valve&#x27;s. Valve partnered with Electronic Arts for the retail distribution of its games, including the Xbox version of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;.

=== Retail editions ===
&quot;Half-Life 2&quot; was simultaneously released through Steam, CD, and on DVD in several editions. Through Steam, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; had three packages that a customer could order. The basic version (&quot;Bronze&quot;) includes only &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and &quot;Counter-Strike: Source&quot;, whereas the &quot;Silver&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot; editions also include &quot;Half-Life: Source&quot; and &quot;Day of Defeat: Source&quot; (ports of the original &quot;Half-Life&quot; and the &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; mod to the new engine). The &quot;Gold Edition&quot; additionally includes merchandise, such as a baseball cap, a strategy guide and CD containing the soundtrack used in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;.

The boxed retail copies of the game come in two editions — Standard and &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. The &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; differs from the physical items in the &quot;Gold Edition&quot;, and includes a T-shirt and sample of the Prima strategy guide. Both the disc and Steam versions require Steam to be installed and active for play to occur.

In September 2005, Electronic Arts distributed the &quot;Game of the Year Edition&quot; of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. Compared to the original CD release of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, the &quot;Game of the Year Edition&quot; also includes &quot;Half-Life: Source&quot;.

=== Ports ===
In 2006, Valve partnered with Taito to release &quot;Half-Life 2: Survivor&quot;, an arcade game, for the Japanese market. Valve re-released &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; as part of the 2007 compilation &quot;The Orange Box&quot; for Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. On May 26, 2010, &quot;Half-Life 2, Episode One&quot; and &quot;Episode Two&quot; were released for Mac OS X. In 2013, Valve ported &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; to Linux and released a free update adding support for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. An NVIDIA Shield Tablet-exclusive port for Android was released on May 12, 2014.

=== Updates ===
Valve released a deathmatch mode, &quot;Half-Life 2: Deathmatch,&quot; in 2004. In 2005, Valve released an extra level, &quot;Lost Coast&quot;, as a free download to anyone who purchased &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. &quot;Lost Coast&quot; acted as a technology demonstration, showcasing new lighting techniques and high-dynamic-range rendering in the Source engine.

On December 22, 2005, Valve released a 64-bit version of the Source engine for x86-64 processor-based systems running Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 x64, Windows Vista x64, or Windows Server 2008 x64. This enabled &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and other Source games to run natively on 64-bit processors, bypassing the 32-bit compatibility layer. Newell said it was &quot;an important step in the evolution of our game content and tools&quot;, and that the game benefited greatly from the update. Some users reported major performance improvements, though the technology site &quot;Techgage&quot; found stability problems and no notable frame rate improvement. In January 2022, Valve updated &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; with a new interface designed for its portable Steam Deck device.
On the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary in November 2024, Valve made &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; temporarily free on Steam and updated it to incorporate &quot;Episode One&quot;, &quot;Episode Two&quot; and &quot;Lost Coast&quot;, improve graphics and controls, restore lost content, fix bugs and add developer commentary. &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; reached a new peak of 64,085 concurrent players on Steam, surpassing the previous record of 16,101 in August 2021. Valve also released a two-hour making-of documentary.

=== Mods ===

Since the release of the Source engine SDK, a large number of modifications (mods) have been developed by the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; community. Mods vary in scale, from fan-created levels like &quot;Minerva&quot; and weapons, to partial conversions such as &quot;Rock 24&quot;, &quot;Half-Life 2 Substance&quot; and &quot;SMOD&quot; (which modify the storyline and gameplay of the pre-existing game), SourceForts and &quot;Garry&#x27;s Mod&quot; (which allow the player to experiment with the physics system in a sandbox mode), to total conversions such as &quot;Black Mesa&quot;, &quot;Dystopia&quot;, &quot;Zombie Master&quot; or &quot;Iron Grip: The Oppression&quot;, the last of which transforms the game from a first-person shooter into a real-time strategy game. 

Some mods take place in the &quot;Half-Life&quot; universe; others in completely original settings. Many more mods are still in development, including &quot;Lift&quot;, &quot;The Myriad&quot;, &quot;Operation Black Mesa&quot;, and &quot;Infinite Finality&quot;. Several multiplayer mods, such as &quot;Pirates, Vikings and Knights II&quot;, a predominately sword-fighting game; &quot;&quot;, which focuses on realistic modern infantry combat; and &quot;Jailbreak Source&quot; have been opened to the public as a beta. In September 2022, after a decade of development, fans released &quot;Half Life 2: VR Mod,&quot; allowing &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; to be played in virtual reality. 

As part of its community support, Valve announced in September 2008 that several mods, with more planned in the future, were being integrated into the Steamworks program, allowing the mods to make full use of Steam&#x27;s distribution and update capabilities. &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; introduced a community workshop as part of their 20th-anniversary update. In 2023, Nvidia announced &quot;Half-Life 2 RTX&quot;, a collaboration with fan developers to add ray tracing and other graphical upgrades using Nvidia&#x27;s Remix tools.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Half-Life 2&quot; has an aggregate score of 96/100 on Metacritic based on 81 reviews. Sources such as &quot;1UP&quot;, &quot;GameSpy&quot;, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;VideoGamer.com&quot; gave it perfect scores, and others, such as &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;GamesRadar&quot;, and &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, gave near-perfect scores. It was the fifth game to receive ten out of ten from &quot;Edge&quot;. Critics praised the graphics, physics, story and gameplay. &quot;Maximum PC&quot; awarded &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; 11 on their rating scale which normally peaks at 10, calling it &quot;the best game ever made&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; PC version sold 680,000 copies and had earned $34.3 million by August 2006. It was the country&#x27;s 17th best-selling PC game between January 2000 and August 2006. It received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. &quot;Forbes&quot; reported on February 9, 2011, that the game had sold 12 million copies worldwide.

In a review of &quot;The Orange Box&quot;, IGN stated that although &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; has already been released through other media, the game itself is still enjoyable on a console. They also noted that the physics of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; are impressive despite it being a console game. However, it was noted that the graphics on the Xbox 360 version of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; were not as impressive as when it was released on the PC. GameSpot&#x27;s review of &quot;The Orange Box&quot; noticed that the content of both the Xbox 360 releases, and PlayStation 3 releases were exactly alike, the only issue with the PlayStation 3 version was that it had noticeable frame-rate hiccups. GameSpot continued to say that the frame rates issues were only minor but some consider them to be a significant irritation.

Several critics, including some that had given positive reviews, complained about the required usage of the program Steam, the requirement to create an account, register the products, and permanently lock them to the account before being allowed to play, along with installation difficulties and lack of support.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Half-Life 2&quot; earned 39 Game of the Year awards, including Overall Game of the Year at &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot; Award for Best Shooter, &quot;GameSpot&quot; Reader&#x27;s Choice — PC Game of the Year Award, &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot; from the Interactive Achievement Awards, and &quot;Best Game&quot; with the Game Developers Choice Awards, where it was also given various awards for technology, characters, and writing.

The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; for their 2004 &quot;Single-Player Shooter of the Year&quot; and overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards, although it lost to &quot;Painkiller&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. They wrote, &quot;&quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, everyone&#x27;s default pick to win this year, is indeed a fantastic roller coaster of a ride, not as great as the original but still leagues above most other shooters.&quot;

&quot;Edge&quot; awarded &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; with its top honor of the year with the award for Best Game, as well as awards for Innovation and Visual Design. The game also had a strong showing at the 2004 British Academy Video Games Awards, picking up six awards, more than any other game that night, with awards including &quot;Best Game&quot; and &quot;Best Online and Multiplayer&quot;. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; the fourth-best computer game of 2004. The editors call it &quot;a masterful single-player experience that plays a constant game of one-upmanship with itself.&quot; It won the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Technology&quot; (beating out &quot;Doom 3&quot;) and &quot;Best Writing&quot; awards, and was a runner-up in the &quot;Best Sound Effects&quot;, &quot;Best AI&quot; and &quot;Best Voice Acting&quot; categories.

&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; awarded &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; the world record for &quot;Highest Rated Shooter by PC Gamer Magazine&quot; in the Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008. Other records awarded the game in the book include, &quot;Largest Digital Distribution Channel&quot; for Valve&#x27;s Steam service, &quot;First Game to Feature a Gravity Gun&quot;, and &quot;First PC Game to Feature Developer Commentary&quot;.

The &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Keith Stuart wrote that it &quot;pushed the envelope for the genre, and set a new high watermark for FPS narrative&quot;. &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; won Crispy Gamer&#x27;s Game of the Decade tournament style poll. It also won Reviews on the Run&#x27;s, &quot;IGN&quot; Best Game of the Decade and Spike Video Game Awards 2012 Game of the Decade.

<text>The Battle of Northampton was fought on 10 July 1460 near the River Nene, Northamptonshire. It was a major battle of the Wars of the Roses. The opposing forces were an army led by nobles loyal to King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster, his Queen Margaret of Anjou and their six-year-old son Edward, Prince of Wales, on one side, and the army of Edward, Earl of March, and Warwick the Kingmaker on the other. The battle was the first in which artillery was used in England.

After the disintegration of the Yorkist army at Ludford Bridge in 1459, many of the Yorkist commanders went into self-imposed exile. The Duke of York and his second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, retired to the relative safety of Dublin, Ireland. His principal supporters the Earl of Warwick and his father the Earl of Salisbury, and York&#x27;s son Edward, Earl of March, reached Calais on 2 November 1459, where Warwick found his uncle Lord Fauconberg. In England, the Lancastrians were quick to exploit the Yorkist flight. The Earl of Wiltshire was appointed Lieutenant of Ireland and the Duke of Somerset became Captain of Calais. Neither however succeeded in occupying their new posts as the Irish refused to dislodge York and the gates of Calais remained firmly closed to their new &#x27;Captain&#x27;.

The Lancastrians gave Somerset an army to storm Calais, but first they had to cross the Channel, so the construction of a fleet was started at Sandwich in Kent. In January and May 1460, Warwick made raids on Sandwich and stole the ships. In June, the Lancastrian invasion was pre-empted by an attack on Sandwich, which had been reinforced with several hundred Lancastrian troops commanded by Osbert Mundford. The Yorkist force under Lord Fauconberg, Sir John Wenlock and John Dynham seized the port, capturing troops and armaments. Mundford was captured, taken to Rysbank tower and executed. Warwick left his uncle, Lord Fauconberg, in Sandwich with a small force of Yorkists to act as a bridgehead for his planned invasion of England.

== Battle ==

On 26 June, Warwick, Salisbury and Edward landed at Sandwich with 2,000 men-at-arms. King Henry VI and his Queen, Margaret of Anjou, were at Coventry with their small army. Warwick entered London on 2 July with an army of supporters numbering approximately 10,000.
The king&#x27;s forces took up a defensive position at Northampton, in the grounds of Delapré Abbey. They had constructed an artillery fortification in what is now a mixture of public park and golf course. The position was surrounded by natural watercourses, tributaries of the River Nene, backed by a palisade and gun positions. The defending army was around 5,000 strong, consisting mainly of men-at-arms. The Lancastrians also had some field artillery.

While approaching, Warwick sent a delegate to negotiate with the king on his behalf. The Lancastrian commander, the Duke of Buckingham, replied &quot;The Earl of Warwick shall not come to the King&#x27;s presence and if he comes he shall die.&quot; During Warwick&#x27;s advance to Northampton he was twice more denied access to the king&#x27;s person. Once in position, he sent a message to the king saying that &quot;at ii howres after none he wolde speke with hym, or elles dye in the feeld&quot;.

At two o&#x27;clock the Yorkists advanced. The men were in column, but the hard rain blowing in their faces somewhat hindered them. As they closed with the Lancastrians, Warwick was met by a fierce hail of arrows, but the rain had rendered the Lancastrian collection of cannon quite useless.

When Warwick reached the Lancastrian left flank, commanded by Lord Grey of Ruthin, treachery ensued. Grey had his men lay down their weapons and simply allow the Yorkists to have easy access into the camp beyond. This treachery was the result of a secret message from Lord Grey to March saying that he would change sides if the Yorkists would back him in a property dispute with Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter (his maternal cousin). Certainly Warwick had ordered his men not to lay violent hands on ordinary soldiers—especially those wearing the black ragged staff of Lord Grey&#x27;s men. There may also have been inducements and promises of high office by Warwick. Grey became Treasurer of England in 1463. After this, the battle lasted a mere thirty minutes. The defenders were unable to manoeuvre inside the fortifications, and fled the field as their line was rolled up by attacking Yorkists.

The Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord Egremont and Lord Beaumont all died trying to save Henry from the Yorkists closing on his tent. Three hundred other Lancastrians were slain in the battle. King Henry VI was captured by an archer, Henry Mountfort.

==Aftermath==
Henry was found in his tent by Warwick, March and Fauconberg. Showing him proper respect they escorted him to Delapré Abbey, then Northampton, and finally London, where the tower garrison surrendered soon after.

<text>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), also known as Commonwealth Bank or simply CommBank, is an Australian multinational bank with businesses across New Zealand, Asia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It provides a variety of financial services, including retail, business and institutional banking, funds management, superannuation, insurance, investment, and broking services. The Commonwealth Bank is the largest Australian listed company on the Australian Securities Exchange as of July 2024, with brands including Bankwest, Colonial First State Investments, ASB Bank (New Zealand), Commonwealth Securities (CommSec) and Commonwealth Insurance (CommInsure). Its former constituent parts were the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, and the Commonwealth Development Bank.

Founded in 1911 by the Australian Government and fully privatised in 1996, the Commonwealth Bank is one of the big four Australian banks, with the National Australia Bank (NAB), ANZ and Westpac. The bank was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on 12 Sep 1991.

The former global headquarters of Commonwealth Bank were the Commonwealth Trading Bank Building on the corner of Pitt Street and Martin Place, Sydney, which was refurbished from 2012 for retail and commercial uses, and (from 1984 to 2012) the State Savings Bank Building on Martin Place, which was sold in 2012 to Macquarie Bank. The headquarters were then moved, splitting between two locations; Tower 1 of 201 Sussex Street and the Commonwealth Bank Place; a new complex of two nine-storey buildings in Darling Harbour on the western side of Sydney&#x27;s city centre. In 2022, the headquarters were consolidated into the Commonwealth Bank Place, with Tower 1 of 201 Sussex Street remaining as a secondary head office.

In 2018, findings from the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry have indicated a negative culture within the bank, amid allegations of fraud, deception, and money laundering, among various other crimes.

In 2022, the Commonwealth Bank held the 49th position in the &quot;Top 1000 World Banks&quot;. As of August 2024 it is listed as the 66th largest company in the world by market cap.

==History==
===Foundation (1911–1919)===

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was established by the &quot;Commonwealth Bank Act 1911&quot;, introduced by the Andrew Fisher Labor government, which favoured bank nationalisation, with effect on 22 December 1911. In a rare move for the time, the bank was to have both savings and general bank business. The bank was also the first bank in Australia to receive a federal government guarantee. The bank&#x27;s earliest and most strenuous proponent was the flamboyant American-Australian Labor politician King O&#x27;Malley, and its first governor was Sir Denison Miller.

The bank opened its first branch in Melbourne on 15 July 1912. In an agreement with Australia Post that exists to this day, the bank also traded through post office agencies. In 1912, it took over the State Savings Bank of Tasmania, and by 1913 it had branches in all six states.

In 1916, the bank moved its head office to Sydney. It also followed the Australian army into New Guinea, where it opened a branch in Rabaul and agencies elsewhere.

===Central bank (1920–1959)===
In 1920, the bank began acquiring central bank powers when it took over the responsibility for the issue of Australian bank notes from the Department of the Treasury. Also in 1920, the Commonwealth Bank took over the Queensland Government Savings Bank.

In 1924, the federal government of Stanley Bruce sought to place further checks and limits on the powers of the governor of the bank, and passed the &quot;Commonwealth Bank Act, 1924&quot;, which created a seven-member Board of Directors comprising the governor, the Secretary of the Treasury, and six directors &quot;actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance or industry&quot;, and a Chairman of the Board elected annual from its members. The first six board members were appointed on 10 October 1924: Sir John Garvan, Sir Robert Gibson, Sir Samuel Hordern, Robert McComas, Richard Samuel Drummond, and John McKenzie Lees. Garvan was appointed as the first chairman on 13 October 1924.

In 1931, the bank board came into conflict with the Labor government of James Scullin. The bank&#x27;s chairman Sir Robert Gibson refused to expand credit in response to the Great Depression, as had been proposed by Treasurer Edward Theodore unless the government cut pensions, which Scullin refused to do. The conflict surrounding this issue led to the fall of the government, and to demands from Labor for reform of the bank and more direct government control over monetary policy.

Also in 1931, it took over the savings bank business of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales (est. 1871), the current account and fixed deposit business of the NSW Rural Bank Department, and the State Savings Bank of Western Australia (est. 1863).

In 1942, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation (CBC) suspended its operations in Papua New Guinea as the Imperial Japanese Army captured many of the towns in which it operated, and bombed Port Moresby. The bank resumed operations later, possibly in 1944.

The bank had many branches across Papua New Guinea including Port Moresby, Boroko, Rabaul, Lae, Wau, Bulolo, Goroka, Kavieng, Madang, Mount Hagen, Kundiawa, Popondetta, and Wewak. On Bougainville, there was Kieta, Panguna, Arawa and early on a part-time sub-branch at Loloho. It maintained those facilities to support trade, local business, government, and small savers.

The Commonwealth Bank received almost all central bank powers in emergency legislation passed during World War II and at the end of the war, it used this power to begin a dramatic expansion of the economy. This was also the aim of the federal government at the time, which attempted to compel the Australian states to conduct their banking with the Commonwealth under the &quot;Banking Act 1945&quot; (Cth), but the High Court in &quot;Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth&quot; (1947) 74 CLR 31, blocked this move.

In August 1945, the federal government of Ben Chifley passed the &quot;Commonwealth Bank Act, 1945&quot;, which repealed the 1925 act and abolished the Board of Directors, returning full executive control of the bank to the governor.

The government also dramatically expanded immigration programs. In response, the bank established a Migrant Information Service (later known as the Australian Financial &amp; Migrant Information Service, or AFMIS). The bank expanded during this period, and in just five years it opened hundreds of branches throughout Australia and in 1951 it established a branch in the Solomon Islands.

In 1958 and 1959, there was a controversy concerning the dual functions of the organization, operating as the central bank on the one hand and a commercial bank on the other. As a result, the government separated the two roles, creating the Reserve Bank of Australia to exercise the central bank function, and leaving the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to operate purely as a commercial bank. Those commercial functions were exercised by the organization&#x27;s constituent sections: the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, and the newly formed Commonwealth Development Bank.

From 1958 to 1976 the Commonwealth Bank operated savings bank agencies in the New Hebrides.

===Diversification (1960–1991)===

A new Commonwealth Development Bank was established in 1960 and during the 1970s the bank diversified its business into areas like insurance and travel. It established a finance company, CBFC in 1974. The bank also became more heavily involved in foreign currency trading and international banking in general.

The bank actively supported the introduction of decimal currency in the years leading up to 1966 and, like most banks, it gradually converted its paper records onto a new computer-based system. The bank created the first credit card in Australia in 1974 when it established Bankcard. In later years the bank began offering MasterCard (1984) and Visa (1993) cards as well.

In 1974, as Papua New Guinea approached independence, the bank formally handed over its PNG operations to the newly created and government-owned Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation (PNGBC). The bank retained a restricted branch in Port Moresby that it finally closed in 1982.

In 1981 the bank transferred its operations in the Solomon Islands to the National Bank of Solomon Islands, which operated as a joint venture (51% Commonwealth Bank, 49% Government of the Solomon Islands).

In 1989 the bank acquired 75 per cent of ASB Bank in New Zealand.

In 1991 the bank acquired the failing Victorian Government-owned State Bank of Victoria (est. 1842).

===Privatisation (1991–present)===
Between 1991 and 1996 the Australian Government under the Keating government fully privatised the Commonwealth Bank. The first share offer in 1991 was valued at $1,292 million, the second in 1993 for $1,700 million and the third was sold for $5,000 million in 1996. It is a public company, but one of the few such companies in Australia whose official name does not end in &#x27;Limited&#x27;.

In 1994 Commonwealth sold its shares in National Bank of Solomon Islands to Bank of Hawaii. In 1994, Commonwealth took a 50% share in PT Bank International Indonesia.

On 10 March 2000, the Commonwealth Bank and Colonial Limited announced their intention to merge, with seven Commonwealth Bank shares being offered for twenty Colonial Shares. The merger received final approval from the Supreme Court of Victoria on 31 May 2000 and was completed on 13 June 2000. This brought into the fold Colonial’s stake in Colonial National Bank, the former National Bank of Fiji. The bank also acquired the remaining 25% of ASB Bank.

Banking opportunities in Asia saw the Bank in 2000 acquire full ownership of PT Bank International Indonesia and rename it (PT Bank Commonwealth). This bank now has over 16 branches and has opened several FX shops to cater to Commonwealth Bank clients who are tourists in Bali.

In 2005, the bank established strategic co-operation agreements with two Chinese banks, Jinan City Commercial Bank and Hangzhou City Commercial Bank; it took an 11% stake in Jinan Commercial, and a 19.9% stake in Hangzhou Commercial. Commonwealth also established a representative office in Bangalore, India.

On 27 January 2006, the bank acquired the remaining 49% stake in Colonial National Bank (Fiji).

At the beginning of 2008, Commonwealth Bank opened a branch in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Then in October, Commonwealth announced that it had purchased Bankwest and St Andrew&#x27;s Insurances from their parent company HBOS for A$2.1 billion. The acquisition was scheduled to be completed in early 2009, subject to regulatory approval. Lastly, on 24 December, Commonwealth announced that it had, in joint partnership with Aussie Home Loans, purchased Wizard Home Loans. As part of the deal, the Commonwealth Bank will acquire Wizard mortgages up to the value of A$4 billion. Commonwealth Bank held about 30 percent of the loan business of financial advisory company Storm Financial when it collapsed in January 2009.

In December 2009, Commonwealth sold Colonial National Bank to Bank of South Pacific.

The bank transferred its ATM service desk from HP Enterprise Services in Adelaide to ITS (Armaguard) in Sydney in March 2012. The bank will change from NCR and Diebold ATMs to Wincor Nixdorf ATMs over the coming years.

The bank is the only financial services organisation to appear in the Dream Employers&#x27; top 20 list of preferred employers for 2010 and 2011.

During the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry it was discovered that the Commonwealth Bank had charged dead people for financial advice services. On 9 May 2018, Commonwealth Bank settled an interest rate rigging case brought by ASIC for $25 million. In the settlement, the bank admitted it engaged in &quot;unconscionable conduct&quot; and manipulated the bank bill swap rate five times between February and June 2012.

On 16 November 2023, the bank announced divestment of PT Bank Commonwealth to Bank OCBC NISP.

==Controversies==
===Environmental===
Commonwealth Bank is one of the major Australian banks known to be financing and profiting from activities destructive to the Great Barrier Reef, something the bank has been facing increased public scrutiny over since a 2013 report by Market Forces; the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated:

In 2014, CBA and the big four Australian banks faced increased pressure to end their support for reef-threatening mining projects, as surveys have shown that &quot;the big four banks would be risking customers shifting up to $236 billion in household deposits if they were to finance a project like the Abbot Point expansion&quot;.

In late 2014, it &quot;was revealed [CBA] was advising Indian coal miner Adani on its proposed development in Queensland&#x27;s Galilee basin&quot;, while by 2015, it has been reported that &quot;all the major American and European banks have refused funds to the project, citing environmental damage&quot;.

In May 2015, a report by Market Forces showed that CBA is the single biggest lender to fossil fuel projects within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area during the six-year period from 2008 to 2014. Almost immediately following, protests were held at over fifty CBA branches in Australia and around the world. Billboards, hoardings and branch signs were revised to read &quot;Coal Bank&quot; and company slogans changed to highlight its investment in fossil fuels.

Later in May, a report by MSCI showed that while other banks are reducing their funding for fossil fuel projects, Australia&#x27;s largest banks are ramping up this same funding; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported:

===2008 financial planning scandal===
In October 2008, former CBA financial planner Jeff Morris alleged to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and subsequently a Senate Inquiry, the extent of the misconduct of CBA&#x27;s financial planning arm, Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited (CFPL), but it was not until 16 months later that ASIC would launch an investigation. &quot;There was forgery and dishonest concealment of material facts,&quot; the Senate Inquiry found in its report. They concluded a Royal Commission or Judicial Inquiry as it was deemed ASIC lacked the investigative powers required to uncover the full extent of the allegations. A week following the Senate Inquiry, CEO Ian Narev publicly apologised while announcing a compensation scheme. Former CEO Ralph Norris also conceded that he was aware of problems within CFPL acknowledging the presence of rogue financial planners but rejected the assertion of a conspiracy to cover it up. CBA has been criticised in the Senate for appointing Dr. Brendan French, who was the General Manager of Group Customer Relations before, as the head of the Open Advice Review program. The CBA defended Dr. Brendan French successfully in a defamation lawsuit in 2015; the decision was a single judge decision and was not appealed after the defence was withdrawn. Criticism has also been leveled at the fact that Dr. Brendan French was formerly a member of the board of directors of the Financial Ombudsman Service and is now working in CBA with respect to customer complaints.

===2016 $76m Ponzi scheme===
In 2016, it was revealed that some CBA staff were implicated in an alleged $76m Ponzi scheme fraud. The alleged architects of the scam were professional poker player Bill Jordanou and accountant Robert Zaia.

===Insurance division scandal===
It was reported alleged systemic issues about the insurance division of CBA. A claimant who suffered a heart attack and nearly died had his claim declined based on an outdated medical definition in his insurance policy. The company admitted this decision was a bad judgement. The insurer also &quot;refused to pay total permanent disability (TPD) and terminal illness claims on the chance that a dying person facing organ failure may have their life saved by a transplant, and that a person can claim their life insurance if they are declared terminally ill by two doctors and deemed likely to die within 12 months.&quot; In March 2016, ASIC announced it would be investigating CBA about the allegations. After the serious allegations were aired in an episode of &quot;Four Corners&quot; two parliamentary inquiries were conducted. One into the life insurance sector, and another into protection of whistleblowers. The inquiries found that no staff involved in the wrongdoings were fired. The only person who suffered a consequence was the whistleblower who had tried to do the right thing. There were also calls for a Royal Commission into the insurance industry. The Financial Services Royal Commission was eventually called and found widespread issues. The Commonwealth Bank was called the gold medallist for ripping off customers by the counsel assisting the royal commissioner.

===Money laundering scandal===
In August 2017, the financial intelligence agency Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) launched civil proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging that CBA had breached money laundering and terrorism financing laws on 53,700 occasions. The breaches related to the bank&#x27;s use of intelligent deposit machines (IDMs) between November 2012 and September 2015—the bank claimed that a programming error allowed depositors to instantly credit cash deposits to their accounts, whilst failing to report amounts over $10,000 to AUSTRAC, and not enforcing any limits to the number of transactions.

===Bank bill swap rate allegations===

ASIC commenced legal proceedings in the Federal Court on 30 January 2018 alleging manipulation of the bank bill swap rate (BBSW). The BBSW rate is the rate of interest that banks charge to lend money to each other, and is a key interest rate used as the benchmark for interest rates on a number of products, most notably business loans, currency derivatives and floating rate bonds. It is alleged that the manipulations took place on three specific occasions in 2012.

===BankWest commercial loan book===
The change from Basel I to Basel II capitalisation requirements, due to take effect on 1 January 2009, required BankWest to increase its Tier 1 capital (share capital) by an additional A$17 billion. BankWest&#x27;s owner HBOS lent this money to Bankwest, but required the money be repaid to meet HBOS&#x27;s own capital requirements.

HBOS, therefore, agreed to sell BankWest to Commonwealth Bank (CBA) in October 2008. The sale completed on for A$2.1 billion on 19 December 2008, and required Commonwealth Bank to repay the capital HBOS had loaned Bankwest.

One of the provisions of the sale agreement was an ability for CBA to claim a price adjustment. A loan was later found to have been impaired at the time of purchase but had not been identified to Commonwealth Bank by HBOS as impaired during the acquisition.

Commonwealth Bank declared 1,958 out of 26,000 BankWest commercial loans impaired (in default of the loan terms), with a total face value of $17.9 billion. As they were deemed to be in breach of their loan conditions, the bank was able to charge increased interest rates, or require early repayment.

Commonwealth Bank lost A$2 billion on defaulted loans that were not repaid (2.1% of the loan book, in comparison to an average of 0.4% across the Big Four Australian banks). Of the defaulted loans, the calling-in of 117 resulted in the borrowing company going into receivership.

Borrowers complained that they had complied with the monetary conditions of the loans: they had kept up interest payments and repayments, and disputed whether it was reasonable to apply penalty interest and require early repayment for non-monetary issues (for example, not having invested the funds for the purpose borrowed, or no longer having adequate security to back the loan).

The Australian Parliament requested that the Parliament&#x27;s Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services conduct an inquiry into the matter, which reported on 4 May 2016.

The committee concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that impairment of loans was related to an attempt to &#x27;claw back&#x27; any of the BankWest purchase price. However, it did find that &quot;in a minority of cases&quot; there was abuse of the asymmetry of power between the bank and the borrower. The committee recommended that there be improvements in the consistency of lenders&#x27; valuation of property used as security for loans.

===Dollarmites===
Dollarmites was the Commonwealth Bank&#x27;s school banking program. In a 2020 Report, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) recommended against these programs.
The Victorian Government and later the Queensland Government planned to stop allowing these programs in their state schools. Consumer group Choice continued to lobby for more State governments to also ban the banking program from public schools.
Finally in 2021, after the New South Wales Government banned it too, the Commonwealth Bank announced the end of the program.

A subset of Commonwealth Bank staff were found to be fraudulently use the bank’s money, loose change, or their own money to illegitimately activate Youthsaver accounts for financial gain. According to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;They would do so when parents had signed up their kids for school banking, often referred to as Dollarmites, but had not deposited money into the account within 30 days. If no deposit had been made, the sign-up would not count towards sales targets and financial rewards.&quot;

==Headquarters==
Commonwealth Bank has moved through many different offices, starting off in Melbourne (Collins Street), then moving to Martin Place in Sydney&#x27;s CBD. In 2009, CBA moved into Darling Park Tower 1. During the Sydney Covid-19 lockdown in 2020-2022, CBA moved staff into their new offices, CBP North, and CPB South (Commonwealth Bank Place North and South), on Harbour Street, near Tumbalong Park. In October 2023, CBA occupied levels 14-21, and 27 of DP1 (Darling Park Tower 1). By the end of 2023, CBA moved the remaining staff from levels 14-21 out of DP1.

<text>The deltoid muscle is the muscle forming the rounded contour of the human shoulder. It is also known as the &#x27;common shoulder muscle&#x27;, particularly in other animals such as the domestic cat. Anatomically, the deltoid muscle is made up of three distinct sets of muscle fibers, namely the
# anterior or clavicular part (pars clavicularis)
# posterior or scapular part (pars scapularis)
# intermediate or acromial part (pars acromialis)
The deltoid&#x27;s fibres are Pennate muscle.
However, electromyography suggests that it consists of at least seven groups that can be independently coordinated by the nervous system.

It was previously called the deltoideus (plural &quot;deltoidei&quot;) and the name is still used by some anatomists. It is called so because it is in the shape of the Greek capital letter delta (Δ). Deltoid is also further shortened in slang as &quot;delt&quot;.

A study of 30 shoulders revealed an average mass of in humans, ranging from to .

==Structure==

=== Origin ===
# The anterior or clavicular fibers arise from most of the anterior border and upper surface of the lateral third of the clavicle. The anterior origin lies adjacent to the lateral fibers of the &quot;pectoralis major&quot; muscle as do the end tendons of both muscles. These muscle fibers are closely related and only a small chiasmatic space, through which the cephalic vein passes, prevents the two muscles from forming a continuous muscle mass.
# Intermediate or acromial fibers arise from the superior surface of the acromion process of the scapula.
# Posterior or spinal fibers arise from the lower lip of the posterior border of the spine of the scapula.

===Insertion===
From this extensive origin the fibers converge toward their insertion on the deltoid tuberosity on the middle of the lateral aspect of the shaft of the humerus; the intermediate fibers passing vertically, the anterior obliquely backward and laterally, and the posterior obliquely forward and laterally.

Though traditionally described as a single insertion, the deltoid insertion is divided into two or three discernible areas corresponding to the muscle&#x27;s three areas of origin. The insertion is an arch-like structure with strong anterior and posterior fascial connections flanking an intervening tissue bridge. It additionally gives off extensions to the deep brachial fascia. Furthermore, the deltoid fascia contributes to the brachial fascia and is connected to the medial and lateral intermuscular septa.
===Blood supply===
The deltoid is supplied by the thoracoacromial artery (acromial and deltoid branches), the circumflex humeral arteries, and the profunda brachii artery (deltoid branch).
===Nerve supply===
The deltoid is innervated by the axillary nerve. The axillary nerve originates from the anterior rami of the cervical nerves C5 and C6, via the superior trunk, posterior division of the superior trunk, and the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

Studies have shown that there are seven neuromuscular segments to the deltoid muscle. Three of these lie in the anatomical anterior head of the deltoid, one in the anatomical middle head, and three in the anatomical posterior head of the deltoid. These neuromuscular segments are supplied by smaller branches of the axillary nerve, and work in coordination with other muscles of the shoulder girdle include pectoralis major and supraspinatus.

The axillary nerve is sometimes damaged during surgical procedures of the axilla, such as for breast cancer. It may also be injured by anterior dislocation of the head of the humerus.

Structures under deltoid 
* Humerus
* Pectoralis minor
* Supraspinatus
* Infraspinatus
* Teres minor
* Subscapularis
* Pectoralis major
* Teres major
* Latissimus dorsi coracobrachialis
* Biceps brachii
* Triceps brachii
* Anterior circumflex humeral vessels
* Posterior circumflex humeral vessels
* Axillary nerve
* Shoulder joint
* Rotator cuff
* Coracoacromial ligament

==Function==

When all its fibers contract simultaneously, the deltoid is the prime mover of arm abduction along the frontal plane. The arm must be medially rotated for the deltoid to have maximum effect. This makes the deltoid an antagonist muscle of the &quot;pectoralis major &quot;and &quot;latissimus dorsi&quot; during arm adduction. The anterior fibers assist the &quot;pectoralis major&quot; to flex the shoulder. The anterior deltoid also works in tandem with the subscapularis, pecs and lats to internally (medially) rotate the humerus. The intermediate fibers perform basic shoulder abduction when the shoulder is internally rotated, and perform shoulder transverse abduction when the shoulder is externally rotated. They are not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated) such as in rowing movements, which use the posterior fibers. The posterior fibers assist the &quot;latissimus dorsi&quot; to extend the shoulder. Other transverse extensors, the &quot;infraspinatus&quot; and &quot;teres minor&quot;, also work in tandem with the posterior deltoid as external (lateral) rotators, antagonists to strong internal rotators like the pecs and lats.

An important function of the deltoid in humans is preventing the dislocation of the humeral head when a person carries heavy loads. The function of abduction also means that it would help keep carried objects a safer distance away from the thighs to avoid hitting them, as during a farmer&#x27;s walk. It also ensures a precise and rapid movement of the glenohumeral joint needed for hand and arm manipulation. The intermediate fibers are in the most efficient position to perform this role, though like basic abduction movements (such as lateral raise) it is assisted by simultaneous co-contraction of anterior/posterior fibers.

The deltoid is responsible for elevating the arm in the scapular plane and its contraction in doing this also elevates the humeral head. To stop this compressing against the undersurface of the acromion the humeral head and injuring the supraspinatus tendon, there is a simultaneous contraction of some of the muscles of the rotator cuff: the infraspinatus and subscapularis primarily perform this role. In spite of this there may be still a 1–3 mm upward movement of the head of the humerus during the first 30° to 60° of arm elevation.

==Clinical significance==
The most common abnormalities affecting the deltoid are tears, fatty atrophy, and enthesopathy. Deltoid muscle tears are unusual and frequently related to traumatic shoulder dislocation or massive rotator cuff tears. Muscle atrophy may result from various causes, including aging, disuse, denervation, muscular dystrophy, cachexia and iatrogenic injury. Deltoidal humeral enthesopathy is an exceedingly rare condition related to mechanical stress. Conversely, deltoideal acromial enthesopathy is likely a hallmark of seronegative spondylarthropathies and its detection should probably be followed by pertinent clinical and serological investigation.

The Deltoid Muscle is tested by asking the patient to abduct the arm against resistance applied with one hand, and feeling for the contracting muscle with the other hand.

Site of the intramuscular injection in deltoid: The intramuscular injections are commonly given in the lower half of the deltoid to avoid injury to the axillary nerve, which winds around the surgical neck of the humerus.

==Other animals==
The deltoid is also found in members of the great ape family other than humans. The human deltoid is of similar proportionate size as the muscles of the rotator cuff in apes like the orangutan, which engage in brachiation and possess the muscle mass needed to support the body weight by the shoulders. In other apes, like the common chimpanzee, the deltoid is much larger than in humans, weighing an average of 383.3 gram compared to 191.9 gram in humans. This reflects the need to strengthen the shoulders, particularly the rotatory cuff, in knuckle walking apes for the purpose of supporting the entire body weight.

The deltoid muscle is a main component of both the bat and pterosaur wing musculature, but in crown-group birds it is strongly reduced, as they favour sternum attached muscles. Some Mesozoic flying theropods, however, had more developed deltoideus.

<doc id="575533" wikidata="Q10972293" url="?curid=575533" title="Treacle">
<text>Treacle () is any uncrystallised syrup made during the refining of sugar. The most common forms of treacle are golden syrup, a pale variety, and black treacle, a darker variety similar to molasses. Black treacle has a distinctively strong, slightly bitter flavour, and a richer colour than golden syrup. Golden syrup treacle is a common sweetener and condiment in British cuisine, found in such dishes as treacle tart and treacle sponge pudding.

==Etymology==
Historically, the Middle English term was used by herbalists and apothecaries to describe a medicine (also called &quot;theriac&quot; or &quot;theriaca&quot;), composed of many ingredients, that was used as an antidote for poisons, snakebites, and various other ailments. &quot;Triacle&quot; comes from the Old French , in turn from (unattested and reconstructed) Vulgar Latin , which comes from Latin , the latinisation of the Greek (), the feminine of (), &#x27;concerning venomous beasts&#x27;, which comes from (), &#x27;wild animal, beast&#x27;.

==Production==
Treacle is made from the syrup that remains after sugar is refined. Raw sugars are first treated in a process called affination. When dissolved, the resulting liquor contains the minimum of dissolved non-sugars to be removed by treatment with activated carbon or bone char. The dark-coloured washings are treated separately, without carbon or bone char. They are boiled to grain (i.e. until sugar crystals precipitate out) in a vacuum pan, forming a low-grade (boiled mass) which is centrifuged, yielding a brown sugar and a liquid by-product—&quot;treacle&quot;. 

Black treacle naturally contains relatively high levels of sulphite (&gt;100ppm, expressed in sulphur dioxide equivalent). These levels are deemed safe for the majority of the population. However, some allergic and respiratory reactions have been reported particularly amongst asthmatics. As such, that the United States Food and Drug Administration requires that levels over 10ppm, i.e. &gt;10mg/kg, be declared on the ingredients label.

<doc id="575534" wikidata="Q7148741" url="?curid=575534" title="Patty melt">
<text>A patty melt is an American grilled hamburger consisting of a ground beef patty topped with melted cheese and caramelized onions between two slices of griddled seeded-rye bread.

== Description and ingredients ==
The patty melt is variously described as a variant of the traditional American cheeseburger, topped with fried onions and served on sliced bread instead of a traditional bun, or as a variant of a grilled cheese that includes a hamburger patty and fried onions. 

The sandwich consists of a ground beef patty topped with melted cheese (traditionally Swiss cheese) and usually with caramelized onions between two slices of griddled bread (typically caraway-seeded rye or marbled rye, though sourdough or Texas toast are sometimes substituted in some regions, including the Southern U.S.) It is typically made without condiments or garnishes.

Like a grilled cheese, the patty melt maintains its structural integrity when eaten, as all ingredients are grilled at the same time and assembled while still hot, which melds the grilled bread, hamburger patty, cheese, and onions into a single unit that does not fall apart while being eaten.

== History and origins ==
Sandwiches calling for hamburger patties to be placed into two slices of bread, rather than into a bun, date to the mid-1800s and were referred to as hamburger sandwiches. It is unclear when the patty melt was invented, but it was most likely the mid-20th century, either during the Great Depression or the postwar economic boom. Several culinary writers have suggested that Los Angeles restaurateur Tiny Naylor may have invented the patty melt sometime between 1930 and 1959, depending on the source; it was on the menu at Tiny Naylor&#x27;s in the early 1950s. Even if Naylor did not invent the sandwich, it is agreed that he and his family helped popularize the sandwich in their restaurants and in restaurants where they worked, which included Tiny Naylor&#x27;s, Du-par&#x27;s, and Wolfgang Puck&#x27;s Granita.

== Home cooking ==
Home cooks typically make patty melts in a cast-iron skillet or pan in steps by separately grilling the patties, caramelizing the onions, assembling the sandwich, and then grilling it as for a grilled cheese sandwich. &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; called it &quot;the great indoor burger&quot;.

== Popularity ==
According to &quot;New York Times&quot; food writer Pete Wells in 2024, the sandwich is &quot;virtually unknown&quot; outside of the United States; Wells theorizes that the amount of space on a flattop grill required to grill onions, patty, and bread at the same time has restricted its appeal outside of typical short-order restaurants. It is typically on the menu of diners, coffee shops, and lunch counters, but in the early 2020s it started to appear on some upscale menus.

<doc id="575535" wikidata="Q814190" url="?curid=575535" title="Instruction cycle">
<text>The instruction cycle (also known as the fetch–decode–execute cycle, or simply the fetch–execute cycle) is the cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) follows from boot-up until the computer has shut down in order to process instructions. It is composed of three main stages: the fetch stage, the decode stage, and the execute stage. 

In simpler CPUs, the instruction cycle is executed sequentially, each instruction being processed before the next one is started. In most modern CPUs, the instruction cycles are instead executed concurrently, and often in parallel, through an instruction pipeline: the next instruction starts being processed before the previous instruction has finished, which is possible because the cycle is broken up into separate steps.

==Role of components==

=== Program counter ===
The program counter (PC) is a register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. After each instruction copy to the memory address register (MAR), the PC can either increment the pointer to the next sequential instruction, jump to a specified pointer, or branch conditionally to a specified pointer. Also, during a CPU halt, the PC holds the instruction being executed, until an external interrupt or a reset signal is received.

=== Memory address register ===
The MAR is responsible for storing the address describing the location of the instruction. After a read signal is initiated, the instruction in the address from the MAR is read and placed into the memory data register (MDR.) This component overall functions as an address buffer for pointing to locations in memory.

=== Memory data register ===
The MDR is responsible for temporarily holding instructions read from the address in MAR. It acts as a two-way register in the instruction cycle because it can take output from memory to the CPU, or output from the CPU to memory.

=== Current instruction register ===
The current instruction register (CIR, though sometimes referred to as the instruction register, IR) is where the instruction is temporarily held, for the CPU to decode it and produce correct control signals for the execution stage.

=== Control unit ===
The control unit (CU) decodes the instruction in the current instruction register (CIR). Then, the CU sends signals to other components within the CPU, such as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), or back to memory to fetch operands, or to the floating-point unit (FPU). The ALU performs arithmetic operations based on specific opcodes in the instruction. For example, in RISC-V architecture, funct3 and funct7 opcodes exist to distinguish whether an instruction is a logical or arithmetic operation.

==Summary of stages==

Each computer&#x27;s CPU can have different cycles based on different instruction sets, but will be similar to the following cycle:

# Fetch stage: The fetch stage initiates the instruction cycle by retrieving the next instruction from memory. During this stage, the PC is polled for the address of the instruction in memory (using the MAR). Then the instruction is stored from the MDR into the CIR. At the end of this stage, the PC points to the next instruction that will be read at the next cycle.
# Decode stage: During this stage, the encoded instruction in the CIR is interpreted by the CU. It determines what operations and additional operands are required for execution and sends respective signals to respective components within the CPU, such as the ALU or FPU, to prepare for the execution of the instruction.
# Execute stage: This is the stage where the actual operation specified by the instruction is carried out by the relevant functional units of the CPU. Logical or arithmetic operations may be run by the ALU, data may be read from or written to memory, and the results are stored in registers or memory as required by the instruction. Based on output from the ALU, the PC might branch.
# Repeat cycle

In addition, on most processors, interrupts can occur. This will cause the CPU to jump to an interrupt service routine, execute that, and then return to the instruction it was meant to be executing. In some cases, the instruction can be interrupted in the middle, but there will be no effect, and the instruction will be re-executed after return from the interrupt.

==Initiation==
The first instruction cycle begins as soon as power is applied to the system, with an initial PC value that is predefined by the system&#x27;s architecture (for instance, in Intel IA-32 CPUs, the predefined PC value is codice_1 whereas for ARM architecture CPUs, it is codice_2.) Typically, this address points to a set of instructions in read-only memory (ROM), which begins the process of loading (or &quot;booting&quot;) the operating system.

==Fetch stage==
The fetch stage is the same for each instruction:

# The PC contains the address of the instruction to be fetched.
# This address is copied to the MAR, where this address is used to poll for the location of the instruction in memory.
# The CU sends a signal to the control bus to read the memory at the address in MAR - the data read is placed in the data bus.
# The data is transferred to the CPU via the data bus, where it&#x27;s loaded into the MDR - at this stage, the PC increments by one.
# The contents (instruction to-be-executed) of the MDR are copied into the CIR (where the instruction opcode and data operand can be decoded).

==Decode stage==
The decoding process allows the processor to determine what instruction is to be performed so that the CPU can tell how many operands it needs to fetch in order to perform the instruction. The opcode fetched from the memory is decoded for the next steps and moved to the appropriate registers. The decoding is typically performed by binary decoders in the CPU&#x27;s CU.

=== Determining effective addresses ===
There are various ways that an architecture can specify determining the address for operands, usually called the addressing modes.

Some common ways the effective address can be found are: 

* Direct addressing - the address of the instruction contains the effective address
* Indirect addressing - the address of the instruction specifies the address of the memory location that contains the effective address
* PC-relative addressing - the effective address is calculated from an address relative to the PC
* Stack addressing - the operand is at the top of the stack

==Execute stage==
The CPU sends the decoded instruction (decoded from the CU) as a set of control signals to corresponding components. Depending on the type of instruction, any of these can happen:

* Arithmetic/logical operations can be executed by the ALU (for example, ADD, SUB, AND, OR)
* Read/writes from memory can be executed (for example, loading/storing bytes) 
* Control flow alterations can be executed (for example, jumps or branches) - at this stage, if a jump were to occur, instead of the PC incrementing to the adjacent pointer, it would jump to the pointer specified in the instruction

This is the only stage of the instruction cycle that is useful from the perspective of the end-user. Everything else is overhead required to make the execute step happen.

<doc id="575536" wikidata="Q4805372" url="?curid=575536" title="Ashley Bramall">
<text>Sir Ernest Ashley Bramall (6 January 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a British Labour Party politician, Member of Parliament for Bexley from 1946 to 1950 and Leader of the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) for 11 years. He married twice – his first wife, Margaret, led the National Council for One Parent Families and looked after their two children.

==Family and early career==

Bramall&#x27;s family were wealthy merchants from Hampshire, but his mother was a socialist and did much to convince her son to support the left in politics. He attended Westminster School briefly, before moving to Canford School for the benefit of his health. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, in the mid-1930s to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He was elected to chair the Oxford University Labour Club in 1938. At Oxford he was an active debater at the Oxford Union Society where he often debated with Edward Heath. He was Treasurer of the Union in 1939. 

He met Margaret Elaine Taylor there; they married in 1939 and they had two children but later divorced. She went on to lead the National Council for One Parent Families and her one parent family.

On the outbreak of war, Bramall had joined the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, into which he was commissioned in 1941. He transferred to the Reconnaissance Corps later the same year and also served at the Army Staff College in Camberley, being promoted to major.

After the end of the war, he served in Germany in the Allied administration. His younger brother Edwin (known as &#x27;Dwin&#x27;) was much later to be appointed Chief of the Defence Staff and created Lord Bramall.

==Parliament==

Bramall had already begun his political career by fighting Fareham for the Labour Party in the 1945 general election, and when a vacancy occurred at Bexley he was selected to fight the by-election. During the campaign, the Government was forced to introduce rationing of bread, which had never been needed during the war, and many were impressed that Bramall won the seat narrowly. He made a successful maiden speech outlining the difficulties in administering Germany and removing Nazi-controlled institutions of government.

In the 1950 election, Bramall lost his seat by 133 votes to his old University adversary Edward Heath with whom he always remained personally friendly. He had already taken up a career outside politics by reading for the Bar, and was called in 1949 to the Inner Temple. He specialised in landlord and tenant issues. He tried to win Bexley back in 1951 and 1959, and also made an unsuccessful attempt at Watford in 1955.

==Municipal affairs==

Bramall was active in local politics in the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster although the local boundaries made it extremely difficult for Labour candidates to win seats. The boundaries had been the same since 1900 and in the mid-1950s the Council decided to change them, using the Rateable Value of property as one way of making each ward equal in size. The local Labour Party, under Bramall&#x27;s guidance and advocacy, challenged this method at a public inquiry and persuaded the Boundary Commissioner to accept a new scheme for the wards which Bramall had drawn up.

After this boundary change took effect in 1959 the Labour Party won enough seats to elect him as an Alderman. He was elected as a councillor to the new Westminster City Council; when he lost his seat in 1968 the Conservative group blocked his election as an Alderman. In 1961 he was elected to the London County Council, representing Bethnal Green. He made the transition to the Greater London Council when that body was set up in 1964. He represented Tower Hamlets and then Bethnal Green and Bow. He was one of eight people to serve as a member of the GLC throughout its existence.

Membership of the GLC made him an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Inner London Education Authority and Bramall specialised in education issues. He was Chairman of ILEA from 1965 until Labour lost power in 1967. He was then chosen to lead the Labour Group. Labour won back control in 1970 and Bramall then became Leader of the authority.

==Leader of ILEA==

In the controversy over education in the 1970s, Bramall stood firmly behind comprehensive schools as a way of raising the educational achievements of most pupils. He was opposed to the use of corporal punishment and had it banned. However, his generally strong leadership did not prevent the scandal over the William Tyndale Junior School in Islington in 1975. He received a knighthood in 1975. Under Bramall, Labour retained control of ILEA in 1977 despite losing the GLC election. He was under pressure to stand as a candidate to replace Reg Goodwin as Labour Leader on the GLC in 1980, but resisted because he wanted to continue at ILEA.

When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister she put pressure on local authorities, and especially on ILEA, to cut spending. Bramall was opposed but was not willing to go along with the far left demands for an outright confrontation and legal defiance. This made the left determined to replace him, and when Labour won GLC control in 1981 with a new left-wing majority, Bramall was voted out as ILEA leader. Knowing this was going to happen, Bramall had cleared out his office and left a note to his replacement on the desk before going to the meeting where the vote for leader was to take place.

Bramall remained on the authority and continued to fight for moderate policies, and it was a sign of the respect which the left had for him that they were prepared to choose him as figurehead Chairman of the Authority.

==Retirement==
Bramall made an unsuccessful attempt to remain on the directly elected ILEA in 1986 at Putney. He was well regarded by Officers of ILEA, especially after the succession of weak far-left leaderships that followed. At his memorial service, a former Chief Officer remarked &quot;Under Ashley Bramall, the ILEA never found it necessary to have a foreign policy&quot;.

In his retirement, Bramall held many public appointments including Directorships of the Museum of London, Chairman of the Westminster College of Further Education, and Honorary Secretary of the Theatres Advisory Council. He remained active in local politics as chair of his local party branch and surprised many by his willingness to undertake menial tasks such as delivering leaflets while in his 80s. In 1996 he acted as Agent in a local byelection which saw Mair Garside, formerly his Deputy at ILEA, elected to Westminster City Council.

He had appeared on &quot;Mastermind&quot; while Leader of ILEA in 1976, taking &quot;British politics since 1918&quot; as his specialist subject, and was an active member of the Masterminders&#x27; club. His second wife, Gery Bramall (who was a fellow Westminster councillor), was also on the show.

<text>Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. (DPSU, or Dr Pepper 7UP, Inc.) was a soft-drink manufacturing company based in Plano, Texas. It was created by the merger of Dr Pepper, Inc. and The 7 Up Company on May 19, 1986. The merger was a result of the independent bailouts of both companies and the subsequent Federal Trade Commission blockage of a Dr Pepper merger with Coca-Cola. The DPSU merger resulted in the breakup of international branding rights held by the two independent companies.

Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. was purchased by Cadbury Schweppes plc and the Carlyle Group on March 2, 1995, after the conglomerate became debt-ridden and insolvent. It sold for about US$1.7 billion, plus about US$870 million of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up debt. This made Cadbury Schweppes the largest soft drink company in the world not to be named after a cola beverage.

In early 2006, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the remainder of Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. and Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group from The Carlyle Group. All Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. assets were absorbed into Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, which included Mott&#x27;s Beverages and Snapple Beverages. Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group was merged with other Cadbury-acquired bottlers and renamed Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group.

In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes spun off Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages into an independent company called the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and renamed itself to Cadbury plc. Dr Pepper/Seven Up still exists as a trademark and brand name as of 2024.

On July 9, 2018, Keurig acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal. The combined company was renamed &quot;Keurig Dr Pepper&quot; and began trading publicly again on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker &quot;KDP&quot;. Shareholders of Dr Pepper Snapple Group own 13% of the combined company, with Keurig shareholder and Cadbury current owner Mondelez International owning 13% to 14% of that fraction. JAB Holdings owns the remaining, majority, stake.

<text>The Thrissur Pooram is an annual Hindu temple festival held in Thrissur, Kerala, India. It is held at the Vadakkunnathan Temple in Thrissur every year on the &quot;Pooram&quot; day—the day when the moon rises with the &quot;Pooram&quot; star in the Malayalam Calendar month of &quot;Medam&quot;. It is the largest and most famous of all poorams in India. Thrissur pooram is also one of the largest festivals in Asia with more than 1 million visitors.

==History==


Thrissur Pooram (തൃശ്ശൂര്‍ പൂരം) was the brainchild of Sakthan Thampuran, the Maharaja of Cochin (1790–1805). Before the start of Thrissur Pooram, the largest temple festival in Kerala was the one-day festival held at Aarattupuzha known as Arattupuzha Pooram. Temples in and around the city of Thrissur were regular participants. In the year 1796 because of incessant rains, the temples from Thrissur Groups (Paramekkavu, Thiruvambadi, Chempukkavu, Karamukku, Lalur, Ayyanthol, Chakkulathukavu, Neythalakavu and Kanimangalam Temples) were late for the Arattupuzha Pooram and were denied access to the Pooram procession. Feeling embarrassed and angered by the denial, the banned temple groups complained to Sakthan Thampuran. he decided to challenge the ban by starting Thrissur Pooram on the Pooram day in the month of May in the same year as a mass festival. He invited temples with their deities to the city of Thrissur to pay obeisance to Vadakkunnathan (Shiva), the presiding deity of the Vadakkunnathan Temple. Something unique about this festival is that everything used in the festival is made fresh every year from scratch. There are people who are given the duty to craft the umbrellas and the nettipattam.

==Participants==
Sakthan Thampuran ordained the temples into two groups, namely &quot;Paramekkavu side&quot; and &quot;Thiruvambady side&quot;. These are headed by the principal participants, Paramekkavu Bagavathi Temple at Thrissur Swaraj Round and Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple at Shoranur road.

===Western Group (Thiruvambady side)===
* Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple
* Laloor Bhagavathy Temple 
* Ayyanthole Sree Karthyayani Temple
* Nethilakkavu Bhagavathy Temple

===Eastern Group (Paramekkavu side)===
* Paramekkavu Bhagavathy Temple 
* Chembukkavu Bhagavathy Temple
* Panamukkumpally Sastha Temple 
* Choorakkottukavu Bhagavathy Temple
* Pookattikkara - Karamukku Bhagavathy Temple
* Kanimangalam Sastha temple

The Pooram is centered on the Vadakkunnathan Temple, with all these temples sending their processions to pay obeisance to the Shiva, the presiding deity. The Thampuran is believed to have chalked out the program and the main events of the Thrissur Pooram festival.

===Flag Hoisting===
The pooram officially begins from the event of flag hoisting (കൊടിയേറ്റം).

The flag hosting ceremony (Kodiyettam) begins seven days before Thrissur Pooram. All the participating temples of Thrissur Pooram are present for the ceremony, and there is a light fireworks to announce the commencement of the festival.

===Poora Vilambharam===
Poora Vilambaram is a custom where the elephant pushes open the south entrance gate of the Vadakkunnathan Temple, which hosts the Thrissur Pooram, with the idol of &#x27;Neithilakkavilamma&#x27; atop it. 

===Display of fireworks (first round)===
The first round of pyrotechnics, known as &quot;Sample Vedikettu&quot;, happens on the fourth day after the flag hoisting of the Pooram. It is a one-hour show presented by Thiruvambady and Paramekkavu Devaswoms. Swaraj Round is venue for this fireworks and starts at 7:15 pm. The display usually has innovative patterns and varieties of fireworks. Even though there were several controversies, permission was granted to conduct Thrissur Pooram in 2017

===Display of caparisons===
The golden elephant caparison (&quot;Nettipattam&quot;), elephant accoutrements (&quot;Chamayam&quot;), ornamental fan made of peacock feathers (&quot;Aalavattom&quot;), royal fan (&quot;Venchamarom&quot;), sacred bells and decorative umbrellas are prepared new by Thiruvambady and Paramekkavu Devawsoms separately. Paramekkavu Devaswom exhibits this at the Agrasala in Thrissur City, and the Thiruvambady Devaswom displays the caparisons at the Church Mission Society High School in Thrissur City on the fourth and fifth day before the Pooram. In 2014 and 2015, it was displayed in Kousthubham Hall at Shornur Road

===Main pooram===
The pooram starts at the time of Kanimangalam sasthavu ezhunnellippu in the early morning and is followed by the ezhunnellippu of other six temples. One of the major events in Thrissur Pooram is &quot;Madathil varavu&quot;, a panchavadhyam concert, with artists numbering upto 40 members with instruments such as thimila, madhalam, trumpet, cymbal and edakka. At 2:00, inside the vadakkumnathan temple starts the Ilanjithara melam is one of the central attractions of the pooram, consisting of drum, trumpets, pipe and cymbal.

The pooram has a good collection of elephants (more than 50) decorated with nettipattam (decorative golden headdress), strikingly crafted Kolam, decorative bells, and ornaments.

At the end of the pooram, after the Ilanjithara melam, both Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi groups enter the temple through the western gate, come out through the southern gate and array themselves face to face in distant places. The two groups in the presence of melam exchange colourful and crafted umbrellas competitively at the top of the elephants, called Kudamattom, which is the eye-catching attraction of the pooram.

Later all poorams conclude at Nilapaduthara near western gopuram of Vadakkunnathan Temple.
2024 pooram is on April 19th.
Although, a prominently Hindu tradition, a notable feature of the pooram is its secular nature. All religious communities actively participate and play prominent roles in the festival. While most of the pandal works are crafted by the Muslim community, materials for the umbrellas for Kudamattom are offered by the churches and their members. This harmonious relationship amongst various religious groups that has been prevalent historically in the region is something Keralites are extremely proud of.

===Display of fireworks (main round)===
Thrissur pooram main fireworks (vedikettu / വെടിക്കെട്ട് ) are well renowned all over the country. This amazing display of fireworks is held in the heart of Thrissur city, in Thekkinkadu Maidan.

Thiruvambadi and Parmekavu are the main participants in this event. The main fireworks begin in the early morning of the seventh day. Most pooram enthusiasts stay up all night to get a better view of the fireworks. People come from faraway places to watch this amazing display of pyrotechnics. There are four major firework displays in Thrissur Pooram: the &#x27;sample fireworks&#x27; on the day before the Pooram, the colorful sparklers that light up the sky (amittu) by both sides on the Pooram evening after the Southward Descent, the most impressive event that mark the peak of Pooram celebrations in the early morning hours, and the final fireworks the following noon after the goddesses bid farewell to each other that mark the end of the pooram.

===Farewell ceremony===
The seventh day of the pooram is the last day. It is also known as &quot;Pakal Pooram&quot; (പകല് പൂരം). For the people of Thrissur, the pooram is not only a festival but also a time for hospitality. Upacharam Cholli Piriyal (ഉപചാരം ചൊല്ലി പിരിയല്‍) (farewell ceremony) is the last event held at Swaraj Round. Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple and Paramekkavu Bagavathi Temple idols were taken from the Swaraj Round to their respective temples to mark the end of the Pooram celebrations. The festival ends with display of fireworks known as Pakal Vedikkettu.

==Cultural influences==

Despite being a Hindu festival, the Thrissur Pooram is attended by different sections of Kerala society. Several replicas of the festival are held in places in Kerala as well as outside the state.

Thrissur Pooram is considered one of the greatest gatherings in Asia. It has an important place in the tourism map of India, as tourists enjoy the beauty and traditions of this pooram. Rail and bus connectivity is excellent in Thrissur, which attracts many foreign tourists to the gala. It is considered as meeting of Devas (ദേവ സംഗമം).

The Oscar-winning sound editor Resul Pookutty and his team recorded the sounds of the 36-hour festivities and made a movie &quot;The Sound Story&quot;.

<doc id="575557" wikidata="Q668511" url="?curid=575557" title="Aritha Van Herk">
<text>Aritha van Herk, , is a Canadian writer, critic, editor, public intellectual, and university professor. Her work often includes feminist themes, and depicts and analyzes the culture of western Canada.

==Early life and education==
She was born in Wetaskiwin, Alberta (near Edmonton) on 26 May 1954 and spent her childhood in the village of Edberg, Alberta. Her parents and elder siblings immigrated to Canada from the Netherlands before she was born, having endured Nazi occupation in WWII. Van Herk studied Canadian literature and Creative Writing at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, graduating with a B.A. Honours in 1976, and an M.A. in 1978.

==Career==
Since 1983, van Herk has been teaching at the University of Calgary. She teaches Creative Writing (prose), Canadian Literature (fiction), and Contemporary World Fiction in English, and Fiction by Women.

She won the University of Calgary Students&#x27; Union Teaching Excellence Award for the Faculty of Arts in 2011. In the same year, she received the Writers&#x27; Guild of Alberta&#x27;s Golden Pen Lifetime Achievement Award and the Alberta Order of Excellence.

She received an honorary Doctor of Canon Law from St. John&#x27;s College, University of Manitoba in 2013.

In 2016, Van Herk gave the Lecture of a Lifetime at the University of Calgary and wrote a short book to commemorate the university&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

She received an honorary Doctor of Letters from Athabasca University in 2018.

==Novels==
Van Herk&#x27;s writing career began with the publication of her M.A. thesis in 1978. &quot;Judith&quot;, a novel that explores a female protagonist&#x27;s experiences in both rural and urban Canadian spaces, was the first winner of the Seal First Novel Award (C$50,000) from McClelland and Stewart, which granted the book international distribution throughout North America and Europe. In 2018, &quot;Judith&quot; was adapted to the stage by Heather Davies. The play, titled &quot;Judith: Memories of a Lady Pig Farmer&quot;, premiered at the Blyth Festival in Blyth, Ontario on 27 June 2018.

With her second novel, &quot;The Tent Peg&quot; (1981), van Herk continued to focus on issues of both female experience and the Canadian wilderness in a narrative where the female protagonist disguises herself as a man in order to get a job as a cook in a northern geological bush-camp.

Van Herk challenged literary conventions with her third novel, &quot;No Fixed Address: An Amorous Journey&quot; (1986), a parody of the picaresque genre in which underwear saleswoman Arachne Manteia traverses the Canadian prairies in her vintage Mercedes-Benz. The novel, nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award, won the Writers&#x27; Guild of Alberta Award for Fiction.

Like &quot;No Fixed Address&quot;, van Herk&#x27;s fourth novel &quot;Restlessness&quot; (1998) is written in an a-typical narrative form, and features another female character on the fly. In this reversed Sheherazade tale, Dorcas, a nomadic protagonist, divulges her life story to the man whom she has contracted to kill her.

==Criticism==
Van Herk has published a number of works blending fiction and criticism, often set in the Canadian west and the far north. In 1990, she initiated a new genre she called geografictione, with &quot;Places Far From Ellesmere&quot;. As a travel narrative that analyzes the concepts of both travel and narrative, &quot;Places Far From Ellesmere&quot; questions the journeys that take place within fiction itself, including Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. Van Herk wrote the afterword for the 1990 New Canadian Library edition of Marian Engel&#x27;s novel &quot;Bear&quot; and the introduction to the 2000 University of Alberta Press edition of Robert Kroetsch&#x27;s &quot;The Studhorse Man&quot;.

Van Herk has also published two collections of essays and ficto-criticism, &quot;In Visible Ink (crypto-frictions)&quot; (1991) and &quot;A Frozen Tongue&quot; (1992). Both works combine aspects of fiction, memoir, poetry, and criticism.

==Non-fiction==
Van Herk&#x27;s more recent work has focused on the history of Alberta, with &quot;Mavericks: an Incorrigible History of Alberta&quot; (2001), winner of the Grant MacEwan Author&#x27;s Award. &quot;Mavericks&quot; led to a permanent exhibition by the same name. It opened at Calgary&#x27;s Glenbow Museum in 2007, was nominated for an Alberta Tourism Award in the category of Alberta Pride, and won the White Hat of the Year Award from the city of Calgary. &quot;Audacious and Adamant: the Story of Maverick Alberta&quot; (2007) was published to correspond with the Mavericks Exhibition.

==Periodical writing and professional work==
Van Herk&#x27;s short stories, essays, articles, and book reviews regularly appear in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, &quot;Alberta Views&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Chatelaine&quot;, &quot;Canadian Fiction Magazine&quot;, &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot;, and &quot;The Walrus&quot;, as well as other national and international periodicals and newspapers.

Van Herk is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada since 1997, and has served on juries, including the Governor General&#x27;s Award and the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize. As a university professor she has taught graduate students who have gone on to literary success, including Anita Rau Badami, Thomas Wharton, and Jessica Grant.

Van Herk continues to present her creative and critical work in venues in many countries.

<doc id="575573" wikidata="Q7604153" url="?curid=575573" title="Static analysis">
<text>Static analysis, static projection, or static scoring is a simplified analysis wherein the effect of an immediate change to a system is calculated without regard to the longer-term response of the system to that change. If the short-term effect is then extrapolated to the long term, such extrapolation is inappropriate.

Its opposite, dynamic analysis or dynamic scoring, is an attempt to take into account how the system is likely to respond to the change over time. One common use of these terms is budget policy in the United States, although it also occurs in many other statistical disputes.

== Examples ==
A famous example of extrapolation of static analysis comes from overpopulation theory. Starting with Thomas Malthus at the end of the 18th century, various commentators have projected some short-term population growth trend for years into the future, resulting in the prediction that there would be disastrous overpopulation within a generation or two. Malthus himself essentially claimed that British society would collapse under the weight of overpopulation by 1850, while during the 1960s the book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; made similar dire predictions for the US by the 1980s.

For economic policy discussions, predictions that assume no significant change of behavior in response to change in incentives are often termed static projection (and in the US Congressional Budget Office, &quot;static scoring&quot;).

However, when applied to dynamically responsive systems, static analysis improperly extrapolated tends to produce results that are not only incorrect but opposite in direction to what was predicted, as shown in the following applications.

==Applications==

===Technological singularity===

Some have criticized the notion of a technological singularity as an instance of static analysis: accelerating change in some factor of information growth, such as Moore&#x27;s law or computer intelligence, is projected into the future, resulting in exponential growth or hyperbolic growth (to a singularity), that suggests that everything will be known by a relatively early date.

<doc id="575575" wikidata="Q17081436" url="?curid=575575" title="List of irregularly spelled English names">
<text>This is a set of lists of English personal and place names having spellings that are counterintuitive to their pronunciation because the spelling does not accord with conventional pronunciation associations. Many of these are degenerations in the pronunciation of names that originated in other languages. Sometimes a well-known namesake with the same spelling has a markedly different pronunciation. These are known as heterophonic names or heterophones (unlike heterographs, which are written differently but pronounced the same).

Excluded are the numerous spellings which fail to make the pronunciation obvious without actually being at odds with convention: for example, the pronunciation of &quot;Schenectady&quot; is not immediately obvious, but neither is it counterintuitive.

See for guides to the IPA symbols used, and variations depending on dialect.

==Place names==
Boldened names indicate place names where only one part is pronounced irregularly, italicized pronunciations are uncommon. Exonyms are listed among examples.

=== General rules ===
=== Specific places ===
This list does not include place names in the United Kingdom or the United States, or places following spelling conventions of non-English languages. For UK place names, see List of irregularly spelled places in the United Kingdom. For US place names, see List of irregularly spelled places in the United States.

This list includes territories of the United Kingdom and the United States not wholly annexed into either country.
== Personal names ==
Bold names are common; so, while not intuitive, they are among the most well-used. Names in italics are names of non-English origin common among English speakers and only irregular in English pronunciation.

<doc id="575577" wikidata="Q3486427" url="?curid=575577" title="Sky (New Zealand)">
<text>Sky Network Television Limited, more commonly known as Sky, is a New Zealand broadcasting company that provides pay television services via satellite, media streaming services, and broadband internet services. Sky had 1,023,378 residential television subscribers consisting of 517,003 satellite subscribers and 506,375 streaming subscribers. Additionally, Sky had 23,156 broadband customers. Despite the similarity of name, branding and services, such as &quot;Sky Go&quot; and &quot;MySky&quot; shared with its European equivalent, Sky Group, there is no connection between the companies.

==History==
The company was founded by Craig Heatley, Terry Jarvis, Trevor Farmer and Alan Gibbs in 1987 as Sky Media Limited. It was formed to investigate beaming sports programming into nightclubs and pubs using high performance 4-metre satellite dishes by Jarvis and an engineering associate Brian Green, but was redirected into pay television following successful bidding in early 1990 for four groups of UHF frequencies in the Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga regions. Initially operating only in the Auckland region, Sky contracted Broadcast Communications (now Kordia) to provide the broadcast service and transmission from its Panorama Road studios, formerly owned by defunct broadcaster Northern Television. The first Sky subscriber was former Speaker of the House of Representatives Jonathan Hunt, according to Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand.

The concept of a pay television service was new to New Zealand and Sky had early problems. These included viewer acceptance of subscriber television. It faced difficulty in educating retailers and customers on the use of the original decoders. However, this problem was eased with the introduction of easier-to-use decoders that allowed greater viewer flexibility.

===UHF service===
Sky originally launched on 18 May 1990 as an analogue UHF service. Subscribers required a VideoCrypt decoder and a UHF aerial, both of which were supplied upon joining Sky. The signal was sent with the picture scrambled using VideoCrypt technology; the decoder was used to unscramble the picture. Sky Movies was the only channel broadcast in NICAM stereo; Sky Sport and Sky News were broadcast in mono. The original decoder didn&#x27;t actually support stereo sound; if a subscriber wanted to watch Sky Movies in stereo, the subscriber had to feed the audio from another source such as a NICAM stereo capable VCR.

Free-to-air broadcasts were shown in the early morning hours on Sky News and between 5 pm and 6 pm on Sky Sport until mid-1991; however, those without a Sky subscription could view the broadcasts without a UHF decoder by tuning their TV to the Sky News or Sky Sport UHF channel, as the signals were not scrambled during those times.

The original channel lineup consisted of three channels, Sky Movies (later renamed to HBO before reverting to its original name), Sky Sport and Sky News. Sky rapidly won long term rights from US sports network ESPN (which became a 1% shareholder) as well as CNN and HBO providing it with a supply of sports, news and movies for the three channels. Sky News screened a mixture of CNN International and BBC news bulletins and a replay of the 6 pm &quot;One Network News&quot; bulletin from TVNZ, later changing to a replay of the &quot;3 News&quot; 6 pm bulletin from TV3. The Sky News channel was later discontinued and became branded as a CNN channel.

In 1994, Sky launched two further channels Discovery Channel and Orange; Orange later became known as &quot;Sky 1&quot; and then &quot;The Box&quot;. Discovery Channel broadcast on a channel already used by Trackside. The Trackside service was available free to air to anyone who could receive the UHF signal without the need for a Sky decoder, Discovery Channel screened outside of racing hours and was only available to Sky subscribers.

Orange broadcast from 10 am onwards each day with Juice TV screening outside of Orange&#x27;s broadcast hours, Juice TV was available originally free to air. Cartoon Network shared the same channel as Orange from 1997 to 2000 screening between 6 am and 4 pm with Orange screening after 4 pm. In 2000, Cartoon Network was replaced with Nickelodeon.

Later, funding allowed Sky to extend its coverage throughout most of New Zealand: In 1991, the company expanded to Rotorua, Wellington and Christchurch. Then in 1994, the company expanded to Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Manawatu, Southland and Otago, followed by the Wairarapa, Taupō, and Wanganui regions in 1995. Its final UHF expansion, in 1996, was to Taranaki, Whangārei, and eastern Bay of Plenty Region.

Following the launch of the digital satellite service in 1998 (see below), Sky began reducing services on the UHF platform. NICAM stereo was eventually removed from Sky Movies, the CNN channel was discontinued in 2004 with the UHF frequencies issued to Māori Television.

Sky switched off its analogue UHF TV service on 11 March 2010 at midnight.

Sky used a portion of the freed up UHF and radio spectrum to launch its joint venture, &quot;Igloo&quot;, in December 2012. The remaining unused spectrum was relinquished back to the Government and will be recycled to support new broadcasting ventures.

===Satellite service===

In April 1997, Sky introduced a nationwide analogue direct broadcasting via satellite (DBS) service over the Optus B1 satellite. This allowed it to offer more channels and interactive options, as well as nationwide coverage. It upgraded it to a digital service in December 1998.

While some channels on the UHF platform were shared with other channels, Sky Digital screened the same channels 24 hours a day. Orange (later known as Sky 1 and The Box) extended to screening 24 hours a day on Sky Digital but was only available to Sky UHF subscribers between 4 pm and 6 am. Discovery Channel was available to Sky Digital subscribers 24 hours a day but UHF subscribers could only receive the channel outside of Trackside&#x27;s broadcast hours.

Digital versions of free-to-air channels have always been available on Sky Digital meaning that some subscribers did not need to purchase any equipment to receive digital TV when New Zealand switched off its analogue service. While most free-to-air channels have been available on Sky Digital, TVNZ channels TVNZ 1 and TVNZ 2 did not become available until the end of 2001, when the two parties entered an agreement to carry the channels in November of that year.

A SkyMail email service was featured for a time starting November 2002, but was later pulled due to lack of interest (including the wireless keyboards they had produced for it).

The unreliability of the ageing Optus B1 satellite was highlighted when the DBS service went offline just before 7 p.m. NZST (8 a.m. London, 3 a.m. New York) on 30 March 2006. The interruption affected service to over 550,000 customers and caused many decoders to advise customers of &quot;rain fade.&quot; Due to excessive volume of calls to the Sky toll-free help-desk, Sky posted update messages on their website advising customers that they were working with Optus to restore service by midnight. Sky credited customers with one day&#x27;s subscription fees as compensation for the downtime at a cost to the company of NZ$1.5 million. Sky switched its DBS service to the Optus D1 satellite on 15 November 2006. It later expanded its transponder capacity on this satellite to allow for extra channels and HD broadcasts.

===My Sky launch===
In December 2005, Sky released its own digital video recorder (DVR), which essentially was an upgraded set top box similar to Foxtel IQ in Australia or TiVo in the United States. Called My Sky, it offered viewers the ability to pause live television, rewind television, record up to two channels at once straight to the set top box and watch the start of a recorded programme while still recording the end. It also gave viewers access to a revamped Guide and the new Planner, used to plan and access recordings at the touch of a button.

There was software in My Sky that after an hour of no signal from Sky then the decoder locks playback of pre-recorded programmes. This was discovered on 30 March 2006, after the ageing Optus B1 satellite was out of alignment for a 13-hour period and therefore unable to broadcast Sky to over 600,000 subscribers.

This generation of box was replaced by My Sky HDi when it launched on 1 July 2008. These boxes allow connection of up to four satellites which can work with its four TV tuner cards in any combination. The device has a 320GB HDD. The quality of My Sky HDi is 576i via component and 720/1080i via HDMI.

A new feature was released exclusive to My Sky HDi on 6 July 2010 called Record Me. This feature allows subscribers to press the green button on programme advertisements to record that advertised programme.

In May 2009, Sky introduced copy protection on My Sky and My Sky HDi decoders limiting the ability to copy material from My Sky/My Sky HDi to DVD/HDD recorders and to PCs. Sky Box Office channels, including adult channels are copy protected so DVD/HDD recorders and PCs will not record from these channels. Other channels are not copy protected. Copy protection technology is not built into other decoders.

On 1 July 2011, a version of the same decoder with a 1TB hard drive was launched as My Sky+.

===Purchase of Prime Television===
In November 2005, Sky announced it had purchased the free-to-air channel Prime TV for NZ$30 million. Sky uses Prime TV to promote its pay content and to show delayed sports coverage. New Zealand&#x27;s Commerce Commission issued clearance for the purchase on 8 February 2006. Prime was renamed to Sky Open in 2023.

===Purchase of Onsite Broadcasting===
In July 2010, Sky purchased Onsite Broadcasting, later Outside Broadcasting (OSB), from Australia&#x27;s Prime Media Group. The sale price was $35 million but once liabilities were taken into account the net amount was $13.5 million. Since 2001, OSB provided outside broadcast facilities for Sky&#x27;s sporting coverage and was also contracted out by Sky to other broadcasters like TVNZ, TV3, Warner Bros., Fox Sports, Channel 9, Ten Network, Channel 7 and BBC among others. It effectively replaced Moving Pictures, which was TVNZ&#x27;s outside broadcast division, that had dominated the market. Moving Picture&#x27;s assets were eventually sold when Sky&#x27;s sports rights increased in the mid 2000s and OSB took hold.

OSB owned the following vehicles (until 2020&#x27;s sale), based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch;
* HD1 and HD3: 14.3m semi-trailer production unit with expanding side, capable of holding 20+ cameras. They are supporter by tender vehicles. HD1 is based in Christchurch.
* HD2: 14.3m semi-trailer production unit with the capability of holding up to 16+ cameras. It is supported by a tender vehicle with extra production facilities. This unit is based in Wellington.
* HD4: 15m semi-trailer production unit with the capability of using 16+ cameras. It too is supported by a tender vehicle with additional production space.
* HD5: 12.5m rigid truck and can input 8+ cameras supported by a similar sized tender vehicle with additional production room. 
* HD6: Small van which is capable of 6+ cameras. It is supported by a similar sized van for storage and linking
* AUX1: Was an original outside broadcast production unit (OSB1), however it has been converted into a specialised production trailer (not a stand-alone OB trailer) for specialty cameras, additional graphics and houses any overflow production areas for larger broadcasts
* OSB2: An original standard definition 13.5m semi-trailer production unit capable of 14+ cameras. This is supported by a tender truck with additional production space. 
* HD/SD Fly Away kits: Suitable for broadcasts overseas

On 12 August 2020, Sky announced it had sold Outside Broadcasting to NEP New Zealand, part of American production company NEP Group. As part of the transaction, NEP will be Sky&#x27;s outsourced technical production partner in New Zealand until at least 2030. The sale was cleared by the Commerce Commission on 5 February 2021.

===News Corp sale===

In February 2013, News Corp announced it would be selling the 44 percent stake in Sky TV that it acquired via a merger with Independent Newspapers Ltd in 2005.

===Replacement of legacy hardware===
From November 2015, Sky started replacing the legacy standard digital decoders and original 2005 My Sky decoders with a new digital decoder, manufactured by Kaon.

The Kaon Sky box includes built-in Wi-Fi. A Sky Link adapter device can be ordered for free by customers, in order to use a Wi-Fi connection on current My Sky boxes. The Kaon box has an ability to block recording features and storage capacity. The decoder upgrade allowed Sky to cease broadcasting scrambled channels using H.262 video compression in favor of H.264, which means Sky roughly doubled its capacity on satellite for additional channels and possibly Ultra H.265 HD broadcasts in the future. The upgrade of transponders to H.264 was completed in March 2019. Free-to-air channels such as Prime, Edge TV and Bravo Plus 1 remain in H.262 to be accessible to non-Sky subscribers such as Freeview viewers.

Additionally, the My Sky HDi and My Sky + decoder software was upgraded to use the same system software as the new Kaon boxes. The new Sky software had features such as internet capability, search functionality, favourite channels, and a series stack function.

The software upgrade to My Sky boxes contained many bugs and caused thousands of customers to become disgruntled. The major issue was with the screen font which Sky later addressed in a future upgrade.

===Proposed merger with Vodafone New Zealand===
In June 2016, Sky TV and Vodafone New Zealand (now One NZ) agreed to merge, with Sky TV purchasing 100% of Vodafone NZ operations for a cash payment of $1.25 billion NZD and issuing new shares to the Vodafone Group. Vodafone UK will get 51% stake of the company. However, the proposed merger was rejected by the Commerce Commission which saw a plunge in Sky TV&#x27;s shares. Sky continued to be a wholesale channel provider to Vodafone until 31 March 2023.

===Unbundling, IVP project and departure of CEO===
In late February 2018, Sky TV announced that it would be splitting its existing Sky Basic service into two new packages called Sky Starter and Sky Entertainment, giving new and existing customers the option of building bundles. The Sky Starter package would cost $24.91 monthly, replacing the earlier Sky Basic service which cost $49.91 monthly with extra charges for sports, movie, and other premier channels. The price reduction came in response to fierce competition from streaming services such as Netflix, Lightbox, and Amazon Prime Video, which had caused the loss of 38,000 satellite subscribers the previous year. Unlike its competitors, Sky TV was dependent on a linear broadcasting model and its exclusive rights to rugby union, rugby league, netball, and cricket content. While Sky had TV hoped that this change would attract new customers, the company&#x27;s stock market shares dropped by 10% in response to investor concerns about future revenue, knocking NZ$100 million off its market value.

In early March 2018, it was reported that Sky TV CEO John Fellet was pursuing talks with Netflix and Amazon Prime to share content and services. Fellet hoped to mimic the UK-based television company Sky plc&#x27;s success in negotiating a bundling package with Netflix.

On 26 March 2018, John Fellet announced his intention to step down from his position, after being CEO for 17 years. Fellet had been with the company since 1991, first as chief operating officer before taking on the chief executive role in January 2001. On 21 February 2019, Martin Stewart replaced John Fellet as CEO. He had previously worked for BSkyB, The Football Association and OSN. On 1 December 2020, Stewart left the company to return home to Europe. Sophie Maloney was immediately appointed to the CEO position.

===Focus on streaming===
In February 2015, Sky launched its own subscription-based video streaming service called Neon to allow New Zealanders to stream various HBO films and shows and to compete with US-based streaming service Netflix, which launched in New Zealand in March 2015. Sky had initially planned to launch Neon in 2014 but was delayed by systems bugs.

On 16 August 2019, Sky announced it had purchased Coliseum Sports Media&#x27;s global rugby streaming service RugbyPass for approximately US$40 million.

On 19 December 2019, it was announced that Sky would be purchasing Spark New Zealand&#x27;s streaming service Lightbox. On 14 June 2020, Sky confirmed that Lightbox would be merged into the Neon app on 7 July 2020. The merged service retains the Neon brand but uses Lightbox&#x27;s interface and includes content drawn from both Neon and the old Lightbox.

===Launch of broadband service===
On 21 May 2020, Sky announced its plans to launch fibre broadband internet plans in 2021. Sky raised $157 million from investors with a discounted share issue to cover the cost of entering the broadband market. On 10 September 2020, Sky announced that a number of its staff members including Sky&#x27;s then CEO, Martin Stewart, were trialing the broadband service in their homes. This testing was later expanded to a small group of customers in December 2020.

On 24 March 2021, Sky launched the broadband service initially for existing satellite customers only. Sky later expanded the offering to new customers on 17 May 2021.

===Pursuing partnerships===
On 22 August 2019, it was announced that Sky had signed a six-year agreement to take over from Westpac as the naming sponsor of Wellington Regional Stadium, effective 1 January 2020.

On 28 November 2019, Sky announced that TVNZ would be its free-to-air broadcast partner for the 2020 Summer Olympics, instead of its own free-to-air channel Prime.

On 27 October 2020, Sky announced a partnership with Spark, where the Sky Sport Now streaming service would be bundled with Spark Sport for a NZ$49.99 monthly subscription.

On 9 June 2021, Sky announced an exclusive partnership with Disney to provide Sky Broadband customers with a 12-month subscription to the Disney+ streaming service.

On 24 June 2021, Sky announced a partnership with Discovery New Zealand to provide coverage of The Championships, Wimbledon for free-to-air channel Three.

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sky removed Russian state TV channel RT from its programming. Sky spokesperson Chris Major stated that their decision to remove RT came following complaints from customers and consultation with the Broadcasting Standards Authority.

In July 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery renewed its HBO Max programme supply agreement with Sky but decline to confirm whether it would launch its own streaming service in New Zealand. On 22 October 2024, Sky and Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed a new partnership that would allow Sky to remain the exclusive distributor of HBO and Max content in New Zealand. SoHo would also be revamped as a linear HBO channel showing HBO Original content. The Max hub and the revamped HBO channel would be hosted on Sky Box, Sky Pod and Sky Go. The Neon streaming service would also host the Max hub.

===MySky===
All Sky customers have the option to subscribe to the MySky service, per each Sky box in order to activate PVR features on that box. This allows the customer to pause and rewind live television, as well as record three channels while watching a fourth live, on their Sky box. The current Kaon Sky boxes have 500GB and 1TB of storage space. Another one of the advertised features of MySky is the ability to record series of programs using the &quot;Series Link&quot; feature. An older Pace MySky box is also still in circulation with 320GB storage and a &quot;+&quot; version of this box with a 1TB hard drive.

===Streaming services===

====Sky On Demand====
Sky announced late 2006 that it will be using the 30% reserved disk space in the PVR to offer a video on demand service to its My Sky customers. This service commenced in 2007 offering 12−15 movies at any one time. New titles were downloaded automatically from the Optus D1 satellite to the PVR and listed only when they are available for purchase and instant playback.

In November 2015, the Sky On Demand offering was extended to allow all Sky customers to watch subscribed content at a time that suits them, rather than according to the linear schedule. This removes the need to pre-record certain TV shows or films, because viewers can connect the updated decoder to their home broadband and choose stream content from the catalogue of options depending on which channels they subscribe to. This is more akin to on-demand services offered by TVNZ and Netflix, and is designed to give viewers more freedom.

====Sky Go====

Sky Go is Sky&#x27;s video on demand and live streaming service, which was launched in 2011 as iSky. It can be accessed via the Sky Go website on PC or via a device via the Sky Go app.

====Remote record====
In August 2009 an online service was launched where customers can log on and set their My Sky boxes to record programmes. The instruction to record a programme is sent to the set-top boxes via satellite.

====Sky TV Guide app====
Sky has released a mobile app which works on iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad and iPod Touches, Android devices &amp; Windows 8. The app contains an electronic programme guide, remote record capabilities (for My Sky boxes), Facebook &amp; Twitter social functions and automatic programme reminders. The app had over 50,000 downloads from the iTunes App Store in four weeks.

====Sky Sport Now====
In 2015, Sky launched an online streaming service called Fan Pass (branded as FAN PASS), which provided access to Sky Sport channels 1–4, including highlights on demand. Pay-Per-View events could be purchased separately when available. This service was offered at a discount to Spark customers with unlimited broadband.

On 14 August 2019, Sky re-branded Fan Pass as Sky Sport Now, featuring live streams for all 10 Sky Sport channels, highlights, on demand, match statistics and points tables. Three passes are available for purchase: a week pass, a month pass and a 12-month Pass. Pay-Per-View events can be purchased separately when they become available.

On 27 October 2020, Sky announced that it would be bundling its Sky Sport Now streaming service with Spark Sport for a NZ$49.99 monthly subscription from 16 November 2020 onwards.

====Neon====
In February 2015, Sky launched Neon (branded as NEON), a subscription video on demand service. It is the only online streaming service in New Zealand where HBO shows, including &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, can be legally streamed. Neon is available for streaming on desktop or laptop on all major browsers, apps for select iPad, iPhone and Android devices, as well as PlayStation 4 and Samsung Smart TV. Chromecast and Airplay functionality are available too. Prior to September 2019, Neon offered two packages: the TV package, which came with a free 14-day trial, or the TV &amp; Movies package. In September 2019, Neon shifted to a single TV &amp; Movies package worth $13.95 in order to compete with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Spark New Zealand&#x27;s Lightbox.

In mid December 2019, it was announced that Sky would be purchasing rival streaming service Lightbox. For that period, Spark will continue to provide services to Lightbox customers while Sky will be footing the operational costs. On 7 July 2020, Sky formally merged the Lightbox app into Neon. This revamped streaming service allows users to stream on two devices, download films and shows onto devices, rent movies, and create multiple user profiles.

===Discontinued products and services===
====Igloo====

On 24 November 2011 Sky announced they had formed a partnership with Television New Zealand to launch a new low-cost pay television service during the first half of 2012. This was called Igloo and Sky had a 51% share in the venture. Details were announced on 8 December via a press release. Sky offered a selection of channels on a pre-pay basis.

The Igloo service was provided through DVB-T and was available in areas of New Zealand where Freeview&#x27;s terrestrial service is available. Customers required an Igloo set top box and UHF aerial to use the Igloo service. Unlike Sky Digital and Sky &#x27;s former UHF service customers purchased their decoder from a retailer and the customer owned the equipment, the customer was also responsible for the installation of the equipment including the UHF aerial. Sky subscribers do not own their Sky decoders and are required to return the decoder on cancellation of their service, Sky will also arrange for a technician to install any equipment in the customers home including the satellite dish.
Igloo worked on a prepay system where the customer purchased basic channels for 30 days, the customer was able to discontinue their service at any time and could continue to be able to access free-to-air channels. Customers could also purchase one-off shows such as movies or sport events.

The Igloo service was closed on 1 March 2017, and Igloo boxes can still be used to access free-to-air channels by updating the system software of the box.

====Fatso====
Sky also owned an Online DVD and video game rental service called Fatso. It discontinued business in December 2017.

====Magazine publishing====
Sky provided a &quot;Skywatch&quot; monthly magazine to all its customers, published by Stuff and printed by Ovato. Skywatch once had a readership of 965,000 which made it the largest magazine read in New Zealand, and the largest monthly magazine. The magazine provided monthly listings for Sky channels, as well as highlights and features. The publication moved to digital only in April 2020 and was discontinued in August 2020.

In January 2007, Sky launched &quot;Sky Sport: The Magazine&quot;, as the published extension of the Sky Sport television package. The magazine featured articles by local and international sports writers, as well as sports photography. Sky TV Rugby commentator Scotty Stevenson was the editor. Publication ceased in June 2015.

==Technical==
Sky satellite subscribers receive a standard 60-centimetre satellite dish installed on their home along with set-top boxes as part of the installation.

Sky switched from the ageing Optus B1 to the Optus D1 satellite for its DBS service on 15 November 2006. Initially, Sky used vertically polarised transponders on Optus D1 (as it had on Optus B1). However, on 31 July 2007 it moved its programming to horizontally polarised transponders with New Zealand-specific beams to be consistent with Freeview and to gain access to more transmission capacity. Sky have also purchased some of the capacity of Optus D3, which was launched mid August 2009, this gives Sky the ability to add more channels and upgrade existing channels to HD in the future. However, due to the LNB switching that would be required the single D3 transponder lease was later dropped in 2011.

A set-top box (STB) is used to decrypt the satellite signals. Digital broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-4 AVC. Interactive services and the EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system.

==Equipment ownership==
When a customer subscribes to Sky they will have a decoder professionally installed and a satellite dish installed if one isn&#x27;t already available. Sky maintains ownership of the equipment and part of the customers monthly subscription cost includes the rental of the decoder. Customers who have My Sky pay an additional cost per month. If a customer wants to discontinue their Sky service on a temporary basis the customer can switch to a decoder rental option which allows the customer to receive free-to-air channels only.

When the customer cancels a Sky subscription the customer is required to return the equipment but not the satellite dish. If the customer moves to another address the customer is required to leave the satellite dish behind and arrange for a new satellite dish to be installed at the new address, at the customers expense, if a satellite dish has not already been installed at the new address. The satellite dish can be used to receive the Freeview satellite service using a Freeview set top box.

==Reputation==
The 2016 NZ Corporate Reputation Index placed Sky in last place. The Corporate Reputation Index lists the top 25 companies in New Zealand based on revenue sourced from the 2015 Deloitte Top 200 list, and is judged by consumers with no company input. In the 2016 list Sky had dropped two places to number 25 from 2015.

In the 2020 Brand Reputation Index, Sky came in at Number 9 in the Top 10 Brands Delivering Brand Purpose.

<text>Independent Newspapers Limited (INL) was a newspaper publisher in New Zealand. Started as the Wellington Publishing Company in 1906 to publish &quot;The Dominion&quot;, it began taking over other newspapers in the 1970s and was renamed Independent Newspapers in 1972. It accumulated more than 80 publications before selling them all to Fairfax in 2003. INL then merged into Sky Network Television in 2005.
INL was part-owned by News Limited since early in 1964, when Rupert Murdoch made his first overseas newspaper investment – a 29.57 percent stake in the Wellington Publishing Company. The News Limited holding in INL fluctuated over the years and was just over 49 percent in 1997.

==History==
The company sprang out of the Wellington Publishing Company Limited that had been founded in 1906 to publish Wellington&#x27;s morning daily, &quot;The Dominion&quot;. In 1970 Wellington Publishing Company made a successful takeover bid for Truth (NZ) Ltd and the following year acquired Independent Publishers Ltd, owner of the Waikato Times. In 1972 it took over Blundell Bros Limited, publisher of Wellington&#x27;s Evening Post which had started in 1865.

Later in 1972 the company changed its name to Independent Newspapers Limited. Around this time INL Print Limited (later Inprint Ltd) was formed to combine the printing and publishing operations of the commercial printing companies which operated prior to the various mergers.

Some of the oldest newspapers in New Zealand joined the INL stable in the next two decades. In 1980 it took over The Manawatu Standard Limited, publisher of the Evening Standard since 1880. Four years later the company shifted its sights to the South Island, acquiring 122-year-old The Southland Times. The following year, 1985, it took over The Timaru Herald, founded in 1864 and a daily newspaper since 1878. In 1987 the Christchurch Press Co Ltd, publisher of The Press since 1861, joined the INL group.

INL moved north again in 1989, buying Taranaki Newspapers Limited and part of NZ News Limited, including the Auckland Star, the Sunday Star and Suburban Newspapers (Auckland), New Zealand&#x27;s largest group of free community newspapers. The Auckland Star was subsequently closed down.

In 1993 INL moved south again, acquiring the Nelson Evening Mail (since renamed The Nelson Mail). The Marlborough Express was bought in 1998 and a number of small community newspapers have also been acquired in recent times, including South Otago Newspapers.

INL&#x27;s New Zealand divisions eventually published more than 80 daily, Sunday, community, suburban and weekly newspaper titles, magazines and specialist publications. New Zealand growth was complemented by offshore expansion. Independent News Corp (Inc) was formed in the United States and acquired a string of suburbans in Houston Texas and a number of newspapers on the West Coast. INL&#x27;s US interests were sold in July 1998.

In 1990 INL invested $200 million in Gordon and Gotch magazine distributors in Australia and New Zealand, their allied business and regional newspapers in Victoria, Australia. These operations were bought from major INL shareholder News Ltd. In 1993 it divested itself of Wiljef Stationery and its computer consumables company Microtronix, acquired as part of the Gordon and Gotch deal but regarded as outside INL&#x27;s &quot;core&quot; business. It also sold its large commercial printing division (Adams Print) to Pacific Magazine and Printing Limited. Late in 1999 INL announced it was selling its Australian Gordon and Gotch division, but was retaining Gordon and Gotch (NZ) Ltd.

Early in 1964 Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Limited made his first overseas newspaper investment - a 29.57 percent stake in the Wellington Publishing Company. The News Limited holding in INL fluctuated over the years and was just over 49 percent in 1997.

Having established a strong newspaper publishing network, INL turned its interests to building a magazine division in New Zealand with publications focusing on home, family and outdoor leisure activities - homes, gardening, fishing, boating - along with motoring magazines.

INL took a 25% interest in Terabyte, a web design and development company, in 1994. This was increased to 51% in June 1995. INL sold its interest in Terabyte Interactive in 1999.

INL bought 48% of Sky Network Television in 1997. INL started Stuff.co.nz, a news website, in 2000.

It sold its publishing assets, including Wellington&#x27;s &quot;Dominion Post&quot;, to the John Fairfax conglomerate of Australia on 30 June 2003. This left it with a 78% stake in Sky Network Television as its main asset. In July 2005, Independent Newspapers merged with Sky Network Television into a new company, MergeCo, which was renamed Sky Network Television Limited. Most of the publications now belong to Stuff.

<doc id="575590" wikidata="Q5975887" url="?curid=575590" title="Navy blue">
<text>Navy blue is a dark shade of the color blue.

Navy blue got its name from the dark blue (contrasted with naval white) worn by officers in the Royal Navy since 1748 and subsequently adopted by other navies around the world. When this color name, taken from the usual color of the uniforms of sailors, originally came into use in the early 19th century, it was initially called &quot;marine blue&quot;, but the name of the color soon changed to &quot;navy blue&quot;.

An early use of &quot;navy blue&quot; as a color name in English was in 1840 though the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; has a citation from 1813.

== Variations ==
=== Indigo dye ===

Indigo dye is the color that is called &quot;Añil&quot; (the Spanish word for &quot;indigo dye&quot;) in the &quot;Guía de coloraciones&quot; (&quot;Guide to colorations&quot;) by Rosa Gallego and Juan Carlos Sanz, a color dictionary published in 2005 that is widely popular in the Hispanophone realm.

Indigo dye is the basis for all the historical navy blue colors, since in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, almost all navy uniforms were made by dyeing them with various shades of indigo dye.
=== Navy blue (Crayola) ===
The Crayola color named &quot;navy blue&quot; is not as dark a shade as the blues actually used by navies.

This tone of navy blue was formulated as a Crayola color in 1958.
=== Peacoat ===
The source of this color is the Pantone textile cotton extended color list, color #19-3920 TCX—peacoat.

=== Persian indigo ===

The color Persian indigo is displayed at right. Another name for this color is regimental because in the 19th century it was commonly used by many nations for navy uniforms, though it is seldom used in modern times.

&quot;Persian indigo&quot; is named for an association with a product from Persia: Persian cloth dyed with indigo.

The first recorded use of &quot;regimental&quot; (the original name for the color now called Persian indigo) as a color name in English was in 1912.
=== Space cadet ===

&quot;Space cadet&quot; is one of the colors on the Resene Color List, a color list widely popular in Australia and New Zealand. The color was formulated in 2007.

This color is apparently a formulation of an impression of the color that cadets in space navy training would wear.
== In culture ==

=== Computers ===

* The color &quot;navy&quot; was one of the original 16 HTML/CSS colors initially formulated for standardized computer display in the late 1980s.

=== Military ===
* In many world navies, including the United States Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy, uniforms which are called &quot;navy blue&quot; are, in actuality, colored black, as the uniforms became progressively darker over time to counter fading of the dye, though for modern dyes are fade resistant. The Canadian Forces dress instructions specify that navy blue&#x27; is a tone of black&quot;. (See also uniforms of the United States Navy and uniforms of the Canadian Forces.)

=== Music ===
* &quot;Navy Blue&quot; is an album by Diane Renay (all the songs are about sailors).
