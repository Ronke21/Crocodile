<text>Frithjof Schuon ( ; ; 18 June 1907 – 5 May 1998) was a Swiss metaphysician of German descent, belonging to the Traditionalist School of Perennialism. He was the author of more than twenty works in French on metaphysics, spirituality, religion, anthropology and art, which have been translated into English and many other languages. He was also a painter and a poet.
With René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy, Schuon is recognized as one of the major 20th-century representatives of the &quot;philosophia perennis&quot;. Like them, he affirmed the reality of an absolute Principle – God – from which the universe emanates, and maintained that all divine revelations, despite their differences, possess a common essence: one and the same Truth. He also shared with them the certitude that man is potentially capable of supra-rational knowledge, and undertook a sustained critique of the modern mentality severed, according to him, from its traditional roots. Following Plato, Plotinus, Adi Shankara, Meister Eckhart, Ibn Arabī and other metaphysicians, Schuon sought to affirm the metaphysical unity between the Principle and its manifestation.

Initiated by Sheikh Ahmad al-Alawī into the Sufi Shādhilī order, he founded the &quot;Tarīqa Maryamiyya&quot;. His writings strongly emphasize the universality of metaphysical doctrine, along with the necessity of practising a religion; he also insists on the importance of the virtues and of beauty.

Schuon cultivated close relationships with a large number of personages of diverse religious and spiritual horizons. He had a particular interest in the traditions of the North American Plains Indians, maintaining firm friendships with a number of their leaders and being adopted into both a Lakota Sioux tribe and the Crow tribe. Having spent a large part of his life in France and Switzerland, at the age of 73 he emigrated to the United States.

==Life and work==

===Basel, Switzerland (1907–1920)===
Frithjof Schuon was born in Basel, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, on 18 June 1907. He was the younger of the two sons of Paul Schuon and Margarete Boehler, both of whom were of German origin (the former from Swabia and the latter from Alsace). His father, an amiable and distinguished man, was a concert violinist, and the household was one in which not only music but literary and spiritual culture were present. The Schuons, themselves raised as Catholics, brought their sons up as Protestants, though not in hostility to the Catholic Church.

At primary school, Schuon met the future metaphysician and art specialist Titus Burckhardt, who remained a lifelong friend. From the age of ten, his search for truth led him to read not only the Bible but also the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavad-Gītā&quot; and the &quot;Quran&quot;, as well as Plato, Emerson, Goethe and Schiller. Schuon would later say that in his early youth four things had always moved him most profoundly: &quot;the holy, the great, the beautiful, the childlike&quot;.

===France (1920–1940)===
In 1920, Schuon&#x27;s father died and his mother decided to return with her young sons to her family in nearby Mulhouse, France, where Schuon became a French citizen, consequent upon the Treaty of Versailles. One year later, when he was 14, he was baptized as a Catholic. In 1923 his brother entered a Trappist monastery, and Schuon left school in order to provide for the family, finding work as a textile designer.

He then immersed himself in the world of the &quot;Bhagavad-Gītā&quot; and the &quot;Vedānta&quot;; this call of Hinduism sustained him for ten years, though he was perfectly aware that he could not become Hindu himself. In 1924, while still living in Mulhouse, he discovered the works of the French philosopher René Guénon, which served to confirm his intellectual intuitions and provided support for the metaphysical principles he had begun to discover. Schuon would later say of Guénon that he was &quot;the profound and powerful theoretician of all that he loved&quot;.

In 1930, after 18 months in Besançon on military service in the French army, Schuon settled in Paris. There he resumed his profession as a textile designer, and began to study Arabic in the local mosque school. Living in Paris also gave him the opportunity to be exposed to various forms of traditional art to a much greater degree than before, especially the arts of Asia with which he had had a deep affinity since his youth.

At the end of 1932 he completed his first book, &quot;Leitgedanken zur Urbesinnung&quot;, which would be published in 1935 and later translated into English under the title &quot;Primordial Meditation: Contemplating the Real&quot;. His desire to leave the West, whose modern values were so contrary to his nature, combined with his growing interest in Islam, prompted him to go to Marseilles, the great port of departure for the East. There he made the acquaintance of two key personages, both of them disciples of Sheikh Ahmad al-Alawī, a Sufi in Mostaganem, Algeria. Schuon saw the sign of his destiny in these encounters, and embarked for Algeria. In Mostaganem he entered Islam, and spent nearly four months in the Sheikh&#x27;s &quot;zāwiya&quot;. The Sheikh gave him initiation and named him `Īsā Nūr ad-Dīn. However, Schuon was soon forced to return to Europe under pressure from the French colonial authorities.

Schuon did not consider his affiliation to Islam as a conversion, since he did not disavow Christianity; in each revelation he saw the expression of one and the same truth, in different forms. But for him, in the Guenonian perspective that he held at the time, Western Christianity no longer seemed to offer the possibility of following a &quot;path of knowledge&quot; under the guidance of a spiritual master, whereas such a path was still open within the framework of Sufism, Islamic esoterism.

Schuon reported that one night in July 1934, while immersed in reading the &quot;Bhagavad-Gītā&quot;, he experienced an extraordinary spiritual event. He said that the divine Name &quot;Allāh&quot; took possession of his being, and that for three days he could do nothing but invoke it ceaselessly. Shortly afterwards, he learned that his Sheikh had died on the same day.

In 1935 he returned to the &quot;zāwiya&quot; of Mostaganem, where Sheikh Adda ben Tounes, Sheikh al-Alawī&#x27;s successor, conferred on him the function of &quot;muqaddam&quot;, thus authorizing him to initiate aspirants into the Alawī brotherhood. Returning to Europe, Schuon founded a &quot;zāwiya&quot; in Basel, another in Lausanne and a third in Amiens. He resumed his profession as a textile designer in Alsace for the next four years.
One night towards the end of 1936, after a spiritual experience, Schuon sensed, without a shadow of a doubt, that he had been invested with the function of spiritual master, of sheikh. This was confirmed, he later related, by visionary dreams that several of his disciples reported having had the same night. The differences of perspective between Schuon and the Mostaganem &quot;zāwiya&quot; gradually led to Schuon&#x27;s assuming independence, supported by Guénon.

In 1938, Schuon traveled to Egypt, where he met Guénon, with whom he had been in correspondence for 7 years. In 1939, he embarked for India with two disciples, making a long stopover in Cairo, where he saw Guénon again. Shortly after his arrival in Bombay, World War II broke out, forcing him to return to Europe. Serving in the French army, he was interned by the Nazis, who were planning to incorporate all soldiers of Alsatian origin into the German army to fight on the Russian front. Schuon escaped to Switzerland, which was to be his home for forty years.

===Lausanne, Switzerland (1941–1980)===
He settled in Lausanne, where he continued contributing to the Guénonian journal &quot;Études Traditionnelles&quot;, as he had done since 1933. In 1947, after reading &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; by John G. Neihardt, Schuon, who had always been deeply interested in the North American Indians, was convinced that Black Elk knew much more about Sioux tradition than was contained in the book. He asked his American friends to seek out the old chief. Following this initiative, the ethnologist Joseph E. Brown collected from Black Elk the description of the seven Sioux rites which would form the content of &quot;The Sacred Pipe&quot;.

In 1948 Schuon published his first book in French, &quot;De l&#x27;Unité transcendante des religions&quot;. Of this book, T. S. Eliot wrote: &quot;I have met with no more impressive work in the comparative study of Oriental and Occidental religion.&quot; All his subsequent works – more than twenty – would be written in French, apart from a major reworking in German of the text of &quot;The Transcendent Unity of Religions&quot; (&quot;Von der Inneren Einheit der Religionen&quot;), published in 1982.
In 1949 Schuon married Catherine Feer, a German Swiss with a French education who, besides being deeply interested in religion and metaphysics, was also a gifted painter. He received Swiss citizenship shortly after his marriage. While always continuing to write, Schuon and his wife travelled widely. Between 1950 and 1975, the couple visited Morocco about ten times, as well as numerous European countries, including Greece and Turkey, where they visited the house near Ephesus presumed to be the last home of the Virgin Mary.

In the winter of 1953, Schuon and his wife travelled to Paris to attend performances organized by a group of Crow dancers. They formed a friendship with Thomas Yellowtail, the future medicine man and Sun Dance Chief. Five years later, the Schuons visited the Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, where 60 Sioux were giving performances on the theme of the Wild West. New friendships were made on this occasion also. Thus it was that in 1959 and again in 1963, at the invitation of their Indian friends, the Schuons journeyed to the American West, where they visited various Plains tribes and had the opportunity to witness many aspects of their sacred traditions. During the first of these visits, Schuon and his wife were adopted into the Sioux family of Chief James Red Cloud, grandson of Chief Red Cloud, and a few weeks later, at an Indian festival in Sheridan, Wyoming, they were officially received into the Sioux tribe. Schuon&#x27;s writings on the central rites of Native American religion and his paintings of their way of life attest to his particular affinity with their spiritual universe.

The 1970s saw the publication of three works considered as particularly important by his biographers composed of articles previously published in the French journal &quot;Études Traditionnelles&quot;. These works have been translated under the titles &quot;Logic and Transcendence&quot;, &quot;Form and Substance in the Religions&quot;, and &quot;Esoterism as Principle and as Way&quot;.

Throughout his life, Schuon had great respect for and devotion to the Virgin Mary, and expressed this in his writings. As a result, his teachings and paintings are imbued with a particular Marian presence. His reverence for the Virgin Mary has been studied in detail by American professor James Cutsinger, who relates the two episodes in 1965 when Schuon experienced an especial Marian grace. Hence the name &quot;Maryamiyya&quot; (&quot;Marian&quot; in Arabic) of the Sufi &quot;tarīqa&quot; he founded as a branch of the &quot;Alawiyyah&quot;-&quot;Darqawiyyah&quot;-&quot;Shadhiliyyah&quot; order.

===United States (1980–1998)===
In 1980, Schuon and his wife emigrated to the United States, settling in Bloomington, Indiana, where there was already a large community of disciples. The first years in Bloomington saw the publication of a number of important works including &quot;From the Divine to the Human&quot;, &quot;To Have a Center&quot;, &quot;Survey of Metaphysics and Esoterism&quot;, and &quot;Roots of the Human Condition&quot;.

According to Patrick Laude, Schuon became known, through his many books, articles and letters, &quot;as the principal spokesman of the intellectual current sometimes referred to in English speaking countries as perennialism&quot;, or the Traditionalist School. During his years in Lausanne and Bloomington he regularly received visits from &quot;practitioners and representatives of diverse religions&quot;.

Thomas Yellowtail remained Schuon&#x27;s intimate friend until his death in 1993, visiting him every year and adopting him into the Crow tribe in 1984. During these sojourns, Schuon and some of his followers organized what they called &quot;Indian Days&quot;, in which Native American dances were performed, leading some to accuse him of practising ritual nudity. These gatherings were understood by disciples as a sharing in Schuon&#x27;s personal insights and realization, not as part of the initiatic method he transmitted, centered on Islamic prayer and the &quot;dhikr&quot;. 
In 1991, one of Schuon&#x27;s followers accused him of misconduct during collective gatherings. A preliminary investigation was begun, but the chief prosecutor concluded that there was no proof, noting that the plaintiff was of extremely dubious character and had been previously condemned for making false statements in another similar affair in California. The prosecutor declared that there were no grounds for prosecution, and the local press made amends. Some articles and books, including Mark Sedgwick&#x27;s &quot;Against the Modern World&quot;, discuss this event and the related &quot;primordial&quot; practices of the Bloomington community.

Schuon continued to receive visitors and maintain a correspondence with followers, scholars and readers. At the very end of his life, he wrote a major collection of over three thousand lyrical &quot;teaching-poems&quot; (&quot;Lehrgedichte&quot;), which combine metaphysics and spiritual counsel, as well as reminiscences of his life. Like the poems of his youth, these were written in his native German, following a series in Arabic and another in English. They are a poetic synthesis of his philosophical and spiritual message, which is articulated around four key elements: &quot;truth, prayer, virtue and beauty&quot;. Less than two months before his death on May 5, 1998 at the age of 90, Frithjof Schuon wrote his last poem:&lt;br&gt;&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:0em; float:left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Ich wollte dieses Buch schon lang beschließen –&quot; 
&quot;Ich konnte nicht; ich musste weiter dichten.&quot; 
&quot;Doch diesmal legt sich meine Feder nieder,&quot;
&quot;Denn es gibt andres Sinnen, andre Pflichten;&quot; 
&quot;Wie dem auch sei, was wir auch mögen tun:&quot;
&quot;Lasst uns dem Ruf des Höchsten Folge leisten –&quot;
&quot;Lasst uns in Gottes tiefem Frieden ruhn.&quot;
 &lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;I have for long wished to end this book —
I could not do so; I had to write more poems.
But this time my pen lies down of itself,
For there are other preoccupations, other duties;
Be that as it may, whatever we may wish to do:
Let us follow the call of the Most High —
Let us repose in God&#x27;s deep Peace.
 &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:3em; float:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Views based on his written works==
For Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Schuon is at once &quot;metaphysician, theologian, traditional philosopher and logician&quot;, versed in &quot;comparative religion&quot;, in &quot;traditional art and civilization&quot;, as well as in &quot;the science of man and society&quot;; he is also known as &quot;a critic of the modern world in not only its practical but also its philosophical and scientific aspects&quot;.
In his writings, Schuon&#x27;s principal themes are &quot;essential and hence universal metaphysics with its cosmological and anthropological ramifications, spirituality in the broadest sense, intrinsic morals and aesthetics, traditional principles and phenomena&quot;, religions and their esotericisms, sacred art. 

===Doctrinal foundation===
====Perennialism====
The traditionalist or perennialist spiritual perspective was initially enunciated in the 1920s by René Guénon and in the 1930s by Frithjof Schuon. The metaphysicians and art specialists Ananda Coomaraswamy and Titus Burckhardt also became prominent advocates of this intellectual current. According to the perennialist writer William Stoddart, &quot;the central idea of the perennial philosophy is that Divine Truth is one, timeless and universal, and that the different religions are but different languages expressing that one Truth&quot; – hence the title given by Schuon to his first book in French, &quot;De l&#x27;unité transcendante des religions&quot;. For Patrick Laude, a perennialist author is &quot;one who claims the universality and primordiality of fundamental metaphysical principles and the perennity of the wisdom that actualizes these principles in man, as expressed in all great revelations and major teachings of sages and saints throughout the ages&quot;.

According to Harry Oldmeadow, this primordial truth or wisdom has &quot;carried many names: &quot;Philosophia Perennis&quot;, &quot;Lex Aeterna&quot;, &quot;Hagia Sophia&quot;, &quot;Dīn al-Haqq&quot;, &quot;Akālika Dhamma&quot;, &quot;Sanātana Dharma&quot;&quot;, etc. Schuon points out that primordial wisdom is expressed in the work of Adi Shankara, Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus and several other representatives of quintessential esoterism.

In &quot;Survey of Metaphysics and Esoterism&quot;, Schuon comments on the three notions of perennial philosophy (&quot;philosophia&quot;), perennial wisdom (&quot;sophia&quot;) and perennial religion (&quot;religio&quot;) to show both their concordance and their particularities: The term &quot;philosophia perennis&quot;, which appeared as early as the Renaissance and was used extensively by neo-scholasticism, designates the science of the fundamental and universal ontological principles; a science that is immutable like these principles themselves, and primordial by the very fact of its universality and infallibility. We would readily use the term &quot;sophia perennis&quot; to indicate that this is not a matter of &quot;philosophy&quot; in the standard and approximative meaning of the word – suggesting mere mental constructions springing from ignorance, doubt, and conjectures, indeed from the taste for novelty and originality – or we could also use the term &quot;religio perennis&quot; when referring to the operative side of this wisdom, thus its mystical or initiatic aspect.
For Laude, it is not the notion of the &quot;transcendental unity of religions&quot; that primarily characterizes Schuon&#x27;s teaching, but rather &quot;a reformulation of the &quot;sophia perennis&quot;, or &quot;religio perennis&quot;, conceived as the conjunction of a metaphysical doctrine and a means of spiritual realization&quot;.

====Metaphysics====
Schuon characterizes &quot;pure&quot; metaphysics as 1) &quot;essential&quot;, i.e. &quot;independent of all religious formulation&quot;; 2) &quot;primordial&quot;, namely &quot;the truth that existed before all dogmatic formalism&quot;; and 3) &quot;universal&quot;, in that it &quot;encompasses all intrinsically orthodox symbolism&quot; and &quot;can therefore be combined with any religious language&quot;. For him, pure metaphysics can be summarized by the following vedantic statement: (Brahman is real, the world is illusory, the individual soul is not different from Brahman).

The metaphysics expounded by Schuon is based on the doctrine of what the Hindu &quot;Advaita Vedānta&quot; refers to as &quot;Ātmā&quot; and &quot;Māyā&quot;. &quot;Ātmā&quot; (&quot;Ātman&quot;) is the Self, both transcendent and immanent; in correlation with &quot;Māyā&quot;, &quot;Ātmā&quot; designates the Real, the Absolute, the Principle, Beyond Being, &quot;Brahma&quot; (&quot;Brahman&quot;); and &quot;Māyā&quot; the illusory, the relative, manifestation. Schuon develops this metaphysical principle, notably in &quot;Form and Substance in the Religions&quot;, basing himself on the Sufi doctrine of the degrees of reality, known as &quot;The Five Divine Presences&quot;:

1. &quot;Ātmā&quot;: Beyond-Being, Impersonal Divinity, Supreme Principle, Absolute Reality, Essence, &quot;nirguna Brahman&quot;.

2. &quot;Māyā in divinis&quot; (the &quot;relative Absolute&quot;, &quot;&quot;Ātmā&quot; as &quot;Māyā&quot;&quot;): Being, Personal God, creating Principle, uncreated Spirit, &quot;saguna Brahman&quot;, &quot;Īshvara&quot;.

3. Supra-formal manifestation: created Spirit (Intellect, &quot;Logos&quot;, &quot;Buddhi&quot;), paradise, angels.

4. Subtle or animic manifestation: the world of the soul and the &quot;spirits&quot; (jinns, sylphs, salamanders, gnomes, etc.).

5. Gross or material manifestation: the visible world.

In the human being (the microcosm) the five degrees, ordered inversely, correspond to the body and the sensorial, mortal soul (5); the supra-sensorial, immortal soul (4); the created spirit (or intellect) (3); the uncreated spirit (or intellect) (2); the absolute and infinite Self (1). The presence of the three superior degrees in man &quot;made in the image of God&quot; confers upon him the possibility of a knowledge that transcends the limitations of subjectivity, thus in principle allowing him to &quot;see things as they are&quot;, that is, objectively: this is gnosis.

As did Plato in ancient Greece, Adi Shankara in Hinduism, Meister Eckhardt and St Gregory Palamas in Christianity and Ibn Arabī in Islam – to name some examples –, Schuon attests that the essential discernment in metaphysics is that between the Real and the non-real (the illusory), &quot;Ātmā&quot; and &quot;Māyā&quot;. He emphasizes that the Real, or Beyond Being, which is absolute and infinite, is the essence of all good (the Sovereign Good). As St Augustine reminds us, it is in the nature of the Good (&quot;Agathôn&quot;) to radiate, hence the projection of &quot;Māyā&quot;, which is simultaneously divine (&quot;Īshvara&quot;), celestial (&quot;Buddhi&quot; and &quot;Svarga&quot;) and &quot;earthly&quot;, the latter including the domain of transmigration (&quot;samsâra&quot;). Every good offered by the world comes from the radiation of the Sovereign Good, every evil comes from Its remoteness. &quot;Mâyâ&quot; both veils and reveals God, the Absolute.

====Quintessential esoterism====
Most religions comprise an exoteric and an esoteric dimension. This religious esoterism is qualified as &quot;relative&quot; by Schuon, to differentiate it from &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;quintessential&quot; esoterism, which is neither limited nor totally expressed by a particular religious form.&lt;br&gt;

For Schuon, integral metaphysics – which starts from the distinction between &quot;Ātmā&quot; and &quot;Māyā&quot; (the Absolute and the relative) – is the very substance of pure esoterism, To the metaphysical doctrine must be joined a method of realization because, as Patrick Laude points out :
The esoteric perspective is not reducible to a conceptual understanding, since it is essentially an intellective and &quot;existential&quot; conformity to Reality or a spiritual and moral assimilation of the nature of things. As Frithjof Schuon has often reminded us, to know is to be. Lived esoterism is, at its apex, the wisdom in which being and knowing coincide.

There is therefore continuity between exoterism and esoterism when the latter appears as the inner dimension of the former and consequently adopts its &quot;language&quot;, and there is discontinuity when esoterism transcends all religion: this is the &quot;religio perennis&quot;, the timeless, essential, primordial and universal esoterism. It constitutes &quot;the transcendent unity of religions&quot; and is based, methodically, on one of the revelations while having as its object the one Truth common to all of them.

====Sufism====
For Schuon, Sufism (&quot;tasawwuf&quot;, in Arabic) – &quot;the marrow of Islam&quot; – is essentially &quot;sincerity of faith&quot;. &quot;On the doctrinal level&quot; this sincerity arises from an &quot;intellectual vision&quot; which draws &quot;from the idea of Unity its most rigorous consequences; its ultimate conclusion is not only the idea of the nothingness of the world but also that of supreme Identity&quot;. Patrick Laude underlines the distinction made by Schuon between a &quot;quintessential&quot;, purely esoteric, Sufism and a &quot;moderate&quot; Sufism which, though tending towards esoterism, remains dependent on the exoteric mentality, whence a propensity to the &quot;intensification of pious acts, emotional exteriorization, obediential zeal, and an inordinate emphasis on formal scruples and the perspective of fear&quot;. For Laude, &quot;the most accurate and succinct definition&quot; of quintessential Sufism – as of every other spirituality in its essential dimension – is &quot;Schuon&#x27;s fundamental doctrinal dyad, entailing discernment between the Absolute and the relative, along with the corresponding method of exclusive concentration on the Absolute&quot;.

Schuon considers that &quot;the whole of Sufism [...] [can be] summed up in these four words: &quot;Haqq&quot;, &quot;Qalb&quot;, &quot;Dhikr&quot;, &quot;Faqr&quot; : &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Heart&quot;, &quot;Remembrance&quot;, &quot;Poverty&quot;.

* &quot;al-haqq&quot; (truth, reality) &quot;coincides with the &quot;Shahādah&quot;, the twofold testimony (&quot;&quot;lā ilāha illā Llāh, Muhammadun rasūlu Llāh&quot;: there is no god but God, Muhammad is the envoy of God&quot;), which enounces &quot;metaphysical, cosmological, mystical and eschatological Truth&quot;. Summarizing Schuon, Laude notes that the first testimony means theologically or exoterically that there is only one God, and metaphysically, that He is the only reality. This latter meaning – that of the Sufis – signifies for Schuon not only &quot;that God alone is real, in contrast to the world, which, being contingent, is illusory&quot;, but also &quot;that no existence can be situated outside God, that everything that exists &#x27;is not other than He&#x27;, otherwise the world would not exist&quot;. Laude notes that this second meaning also emerges from the second testimony, which esoterically enounces the unitive relationship between &quot;the conditioned and the Unconditioned, the relative and the Absolute&quot;.
* &quot;al-qalb&quot; (the heart) &quot;is the existential and intellectual centre&quot; of the human being, &quot;the seat of the divine Presence and thus also of metaphysical certitude&quot;, and also, more commonly, the seat of faith. &quot;It represents the Intellect with respect to both knowledge and love&quot; and &quot;thanks to the miracle of immanence, it opens onto the divine Self and onto the infinitude, both extinctive and unitive, of the knowable, hence of the Real&quot;. Thus truth (&quot;al-haqq&quot;) &quot;must not be accepted with the mind alone but with the Heart, thus with all that we are&quot;.
* &quot;al-dhikr&quot; (remembrance, mention, invocation) is for Schuon &quot;the actualization of faith or gnosis by means of the sacramental word&quot;, whose seat is the heart. Although the word &quot;dhikr&quot; encompasses all practices directed towards God, Harry Oldmeadow emphasizes that Schuon, when he speaks of Sufism, always uses this term in its highest sense: the invocation of the name &quot;Allāh&quot;. According to Laude, this rite – subject to authorization –, is considered by Schuon, in accordance with the Sufi tradition, to be &quot;the central practice of &quot;tasawwuf&quot;&quot;. To the question &quot;why invoke?&quot;, Schuon answers: &quot;the most profound reason would no doubt be &#x27;because I exist&#x27;, for Existence is in a certain way the Word of God, by which He names Himself. God pronounces His Name in order to manifest Himself – to &#x27;create&#x27; – in the direction of &#x27;nothingness&#x27;, and the relative being pronounces this Name in order to &#x27;be&#x27;, that is to say, to &#x27;become once again what he is&#x27; in the direction of Reality&quot;. &quot;The supreme Name&quot;, whatever the spiritual path practised, &quot;is both metaphysical Truth and saving Presence&quot;.
* &quot;al-faqr&quot; (spiritual poverty) is &quot;simplicity and purity of soul, rendering possible&quot; the actualization of faith or gnosis &quot;by conferring upon it the sincerity without which no act is valid&quot;. For Laude, commenting on the Schuonian perspective, &quot;al-faqr&quot; is &quot;humility as the absence of all egocentricity and an emptiness for God.&quot; Schuon sees &quot;spiritual virtue par excellence&quot; in this attitude of &quot;holy poverty&quot; or &quot;effacement&quot;, an attitude that implies &quot;detachment, sobriety, patience, contentment&quot;, &quot;resignation to the Will of God and trust in His Mercy&quot;; it is &quot;like an anticipation of extinction in God&quot;.

===Spiritual practice===

====Spiritual path====
According to the writer Ali Lakhani, &quot;Schuon emphasizes that the meaning of life is nothing less than the quest for [...] God, [...] for the Truth that resides within each of us; [...] it is the return to the heart-consciousness of the Divine Presence.&quot; For Schuon, man is &quot;a bridge between Earth and Heaven&quot;; on the other hand, &quot;the notion of the Absolute and the love of God constitute the very essence of [his] subjectivity; this subjectivity [...] is a proof both of [his] immortality and of God; [it] is, properly speaking, a theophany.&quot;

Schuon reminds us that religious or spiritual life offers three fundamental paths, which correspond to as many human temperaments: 1) the path of action, works, asceticism, fear (the &quot;karma-mārga&quot; or &quot;karma-yoga&quot; of Hinduism); 2) the path of love, of devotion (&quot;bhakti-mārga&quot;); and 3) the path of gnosis, of unitive contemplation (&quot;jñāna-mārga&quot;); in Sufism: &quot;makhāfah&quot;, &quot;mahabbah&quot;, &quot;ma`rifah&quot;. The first two are dualistic and exoteric, and are based on revelation, whereas the path of knowledge is monistic and esoteric, and based on intellection supported by revelation. Just as the path of love cannot do without good works and reverential fear, so the esoteric or metaphysical path cannot exclude the two other modes.

According to Schuon, the path of knowledge or of gnosis, which is present at the heart of every religion, is essentially: 1) discernment between the Real and the illusory, &quot;ātmā&quot; and &quot;māyā&quot;, &quot;nirvāna&quot; and &quot;samsāra&quot;, the Absolute and the relative, God and the world; 2) concentration on the Real, and 3) intrinsinc morality, virtue. This discernment would remain purely mental in the absence of concentration on the Real through rites and prayer, i.e. without an effective link with God, the Sovereign Good, based on an authentic piety and sufficient detachment from the ego and from the world. The way towards God, as Schuon points out, &quot;always involves an inversion: from outwardness one must pass to inwardness, from multiplicity to unity, from dispersion to concentration, from egoism to detachment, from passion to serenity.&quot;

Schuon emphasizes that the exoteric and esoteric rites of the religion practised – and of that one alone – are the basis for the spiritual method. Prayer is its central element, for without it – and without divine grace – the heart cannot assimilate or realize what the mind has been able to grasp. Schuon recalls the three modes of prayer: personal prayer in which the worshipper opens himself spontaneously and informally to God; canonical, impersonal prayer, prescribed by his tradition; and invocatory prayer or &quot;prayer of the heart&quot; (&quot;japa&quot;, &quot;dhikr&quot;), which &quot;is already a death and a meeting with God and places us already in Eternity; it is already something of Paradise and even, in its mysterious and &#x27;uncreated&#x27; quintessence, something of God&quot;. This form of prayer is the invocation of a divine name, a sacred formula, a &quot;mantra&quot;; it reconciles the transcendence and the immanence of Truth, because if, on the one hand, Truth transcends us infinitely, the gnostic, asserts Schuon, knows that it is also &quot;inscribed in an eternal script in the very substance of [his] spirit&quot;; God is both the highest and the deepest, and the knowledge the realized being has of God is in reality the knowledge that God has of Himself through that being.

====Virtue====
In his writings, Schuon insists that the two requirements of doctrine and method would remain inoperative without a third element, virtue, since the spiritual path must necessarily integrate the three fundamental human faculties, namely intelligence (doctrine, truth, discernment), will (method, prayer, concentration) and soul (character, virtue, moral conformity). For Schuon, virtue is indeed &quot;the initial form of spiritual union; without it, our knowing and our willing are of no use to us.&quot; According to him, to have a virtue is above all to be without the fault that is contrary to it, for God created us virtuous. He created us in His image; faults are superimposed. Moreover, it is not we who possess virtue, it is virtue which possesses us. [...] Virtue is like a reverberation of the Sovereign Good, in which we participate through our nature or through our will, easily or with difficulty, but always by the grace of God.
For Schuon, humility, charity and veracity, that is to say effacement of the ego, gift of self and attachment to truth, are essential virtues, corresponding to the three stages of the spiritual path: purification, expansion and union. Moreover, the sense of our littleness, the sense of the sacred and piety are indispensable conditions for the blossoming of the virtues. Summarizing the author, James Cutsinger notes that perfect virtues coincide with metaphysical truths; they realize these truths existentially. In other words, as Schuon points out: &quot;truth is necessary for the perfection of virtue, just as virtue is necessary for the perfection of truth&quot;.

====Beauty====
Although Schuon considers that the foundations of any spiritual path are truth, prayer and virtue, he also insists upon the importance of a fourth element: beauty. For him, the interiorization of beauty presupposes nobility of character and at the same time produces it. Its function &quot;is to actualize in the intelligent and sensitive creature the recollection of essences, and thus to open the way to the luminous Night of the one and infinite Essence&quot;.

To the awareness of divine beauty must correspond not only inner beauty, that is to say virtues, but also the sense of outer beauty, whether in the contemplation of nature or in artistic sensibility, without forgetting the interiorizing role of a traditional home ambiance made of beauty and serenity, foreign to the whims of modernity. &quot;Beauty, whatever use man may make of it, belongs fundamentally to its Creator, Who thereby projects into the world of appearances something of His Being.&quot; For Schuon, these considerations find their source and justification in the theomorphic nature of man, a changeless, non-evolutive nature, contrary to what modern science may think.

===Developments===

====Criticism of modernism====
Summarizing Schuon&#x27;s thought, Seyyed Hossein Nasr reminds us that it was in Europe, during the Renaissance, that the &quot;modernist&quot; or reductionist vision of the human condition and the universe took shape, before it affected the other continents a few centuries later. By reducing man more and more to his rational and animal aspects, to the detriment of his spiritual dimension and the purpose of earthly life, modernism has influenced philosophy as much as religion, science or art. According to Schuon, its main characteristics are rationalism, which denies the possibility of a supra-rational knowledge, materialism, according to which only matter gives meaning to life, psychologism, which reduces the spiritual and the intellectual to the psychic, skepticism, relativism, existentialism, individualism, progressivism, evolutionism, scientism and empiricism, without forgetting agnosticism and atheism.&lt;br&gt;

Regarding modern science, in spite of the scale of its discoveries on the physical plane, Schuon reproaches it for being &quot;a totalitarian rationalism, which eliminates both Revelation and Intellect, and at the same time a totalitarian materialism, which ignores the metaphysical relativity of matter and the world; it does not know that the supra-sensible, which is beyond space and time, is the concrete principle of the world, and that it is consequently also at the origin of that contingent and changeable coagulation called &#x27;matter&#x27;&quot;. Thus, still according to Schuon, the contradiction of scientism is to &quot;want to give an account of reality without the help of this initial science that is metaphysics, thus ignoring that only the science of the Absolute gives meaning and discipline to the science of the relative&quot;. This conception of a universe which ignores as much the principle of &quot;creative emanationism&quot; as much as that of the &quot;hierarchy of the invisible worlds&quot;, has engendered &quot;that most typical offspring of the modern spirit&quot;, the theory of evolution, with its corollary: the illusion of &quot;human progress&quot;.

Schuon&#x27;s criticism extends to philosophy – &quot;the love of wisdom&quot; – which was originally the fact of &quot;thinking according to the immanent Intellect and not by reason alone&quot;. It &quot;is the science of all fundamental principles&quot;. It operates with intellectual intuition – intellection – &quot;which &quot;perceives&quot;, and not with reason alone, which &quot;concludes&quot;&quot;, hence the abyss that separates the certainty of the sage from the opinion of the modern philosopher.&lt;br&gt;

For Schuon, there are ultimately only two possibilities: &quot;integral, spiritual civilization, implying abuses and superstitions, and fragmentary, materialistic, progressivist civilization, implying – quite provisionally – certain earthly advantages, but excluding that which constitutes the sufficient reason and final end of all human existence&quot;.

====Sacred art====

Along with Ananda Coomaraswamy and Titus Burckhardt, Frithjof Schuon reminds us that &quot;sacred art is first of all the visible and audible form of Revelation and then also its indispensable liturgical vesture&quot;. This art communicates &quot;on the one hand, spiritual truths and, on the other hand, a celestial presence&quot;. James Cutsinger emphasizes that, for Schuon, an art is sacred &quot;not through the personal aims of the artist, but through its content, its symbolism, and its style, that is, through objective elements&quot;, which must respect the canonical rules specific to the religion of its author. The latter, according to Martyn Amugen quoting Schuon, must be &quot;sanctified or in a state of grace&quot; because the language of the sacred &quot;cannot spring simply from profane tastes, nor from genius, but must proceed essentially out of religion&quot;, which &quot;cannot be replaced, far less can it be surpassed, by human resources&quot;. Icon painters, for example, &quot;were monks who, before setting to work, prepared themselves by fasting, prayer, confession, and communion&quot;, in order to overcome the two pitfalls that threaten every artist: &quot;a virtuosity tending towards the outward and the superficial, and a conventionalism without intelligence and without soul&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

Echoing Schuonian thought, Cutsinger notes that the various forms of sacred art have as their object the &quot;transmission of intellectual intuitions&quot;, thus conferring &quot;a direct aid to spirituality&quot;, and he notes that this art &quot;is able to transmit simultaneously metaphysical truths, archetypal values, historical facts, spiritual states, and psychological attitudes&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

Evoking the transition from the Middle Ages – with its Byzantine, Romanesque and primitive Gothic arts – to the Renaissance, Schuon notes that &quot;Christian art, which formerly was sacred, symbolical, spiritual&quot;, gave way to the advent of neo-classical art, with its naturalistic and sentimental character, which only responded &quot;to collective psychic aspirations&quot;. Amugen, referring to Schuon, reports that art, having broken with tradition, became &quot;human, individualistic, and therefore arbitrary&quot;, infallible signs of decline, and any desire to restore its sacred character must necessarily involve abandoning individualistic relativism in order to go back to its sources, which lie in the timeless and the immutable.

====Sacred nudity====

Author of a study on human theomorphism in Schuon&#x27;s oeuvre, Timothy Scott notes this initial comment by Schuon: &quot;The distinction between the Absolute and the Infinite expresses the two fundamental aspects of the Real, that of essentiality and that of potentiality; this is the highest principial prefiguration of the masculine and feminine poles&quot;. Schuon sees in the human body a &quot;message of ascending and unitive verticality [...]; in rigorous, transcendent, objective, abstract, rational and mathematical mode&quot; in man, &quot;and in gentle, immanent, concrete, emotional and musical mode&quot; in woman. As Patrick Laude points out, feminine beauty &quot;plays a preponderant role in the spiritual alchemy that issues from the oeuvre and spiritual personality of Schuon&quot;. This role answers to &quot;the highest expressions of gnostic Sufism&quot;, as evidenced by &quot;Ibn Arabī and Rūzbehān among many others&quot;.

Summarizing Schuon, Scott reminds us that nudity represents the norm – primordial man was naked, primitive peoples are also naked – and that it &quot;symbolizes quintessential esoterism [...], the Truth unveiled&quot;, the ordinary garment then representing exoterism. In his biography of Schuon, after noting the convergences of views that unite Schuon, Rūzbehān, Omar Khayyam, and Henri Corbin regarding the spiritual significance of nudity, Jean-Baptiste Aymard quotes this excerpt from a letter by Schuon: &quot;Given the spiritual degeneration of humanity, the highest possible degree of beauty, which belongs to the human body, could not play a part in ordinary piety; however this theophany may be a support in esoteric spirituality, and this is shown in the sacred art of the Hindus and the Buddhists. Nakedness signifies inwardness, essentiality, primordiality and consequently universality [...]; the body is the form of the Essence and thus the essence of form&quot;.

In an interview published in 1996 by the American magazine &quot;The Quest: Philosophy, Science, Religion, The Arts&quot;, Schuon develops the sacredness of nudity:
In an altogether general way, nudity expresses – and virtually actualizes – a return to the essence, the origin, the archetype, thus to the celestial state: &quot;And it is for this that, naked, I dance&quot;, as Lallā Yogishvarī, the great Kashmiri saint, said after having found the Divine Self in her heart. To be sure, in nudity there is a &quot;de facto&quot; ambiguity because of the passional nature of man; but there is not only the passional nature, there is also the gift of contemplativity, which can neutralize this, as is precisely the case with &quot;sacred nudity&quot;. Thus there is not only the seduction of appearances, there is also the metaphysical transparency of phenomena which permits us to perceive the archetypal essence through the sensory experience. When the saintly bishop Nonnos beheld St. Pelagia entering the baptismal pool naked, he praised God that He had not put into human beauty just a cause of downfall, but also an opportunity for elevation towards God.
In a published passage from his largely unpublished &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Schuon remarks &quot;how contemptible is the neo-pagan and atheistic cult of the body and of nudity. What is in itself noble in nature is good for us only in its function as a support for the supernatural; cultivated apart from God, it readily loses its nobility and becomes a humiliating fatuity, as the stupidity and ugliness of worldly nudism precisely prove&quot;.

<text>The crested treeswift (Hemiprocne coronata) is a species of tree swift. It was for some time considered the same species as its eastern relative, the gray-rumped treeswift (&quot;Hemiprocne longipennis&quot;), but they do not interbreed where their ranges overlap. It is distinct in flight, with long, bowed wings and a deeply forked tail that usually appears narrow and pointed.

==Description==
The crested treeswift is a large slender bird at length. This species is dove grey above and white below. The long swept-back wings are a darker grey above. This treeswift has a crest and a long, deeply forked tail. The adult male has orange cheeks and ear coverts with a narrow streak of white under the eye and a trace of a white supercilium. The female has a thin white stripe below the eye running along the cheek. Young birds have a dark grey head and wings but the feathers are edged in white and the rest of the soft plumage is much streakier than that of the adults. They are found in small groups that fly in wide circles in open forest, occasionally perching atop a tall and leafless tree. When perched they appear to sit very upright.

The call of this species is a harsh &quot;kee-kyew&quot; or three note &quot;kip-kee-kep&quot; with emphasis on the middle note.

== Taxonomy and systematics==
The species was first given a binomial name with a description by Samuel Tickell in 1833. He collected specimens during his travels in the Borabhum and Dholbhum area while serving as a lieutenant in the 31st regiment of native infantry. He called it &quot;Hirundo coronatus&quot; and gave it the trivial name of Dhudka Swallow. He noted that it was not found throughout the year. The genus &quot;Hemiprocne&quot; was erected by Christian Ludwig Nitzsch in 1829 but the species has variously been incorrectly treated in the past in &quot;Dendrochelidon&quot; and &quot;Macropteryx&quot;. Jerdon, a quinarian, considered the species to be a link between the swifts and swallows on the basis of their silky plumage, uncharacteristic of the swifts. James L. Peters considered &quot;coronata&quot; as a subspecies of &quot;longipennis&quot; but it was reinstated as a full species based on plumage and structural differences (Prigogine&#x27;s delta or distance between the fourth and fifth tail feather) and distributions of this and &quot;longipennis&quot; in the restricted sense. Dillon Ripley described a new subspecies &quot;dryas&quot; from a specimen obtained by Salim Ali from Rajpipla in southern Gujarat. He considered it to be paler grey on the upperparts than the known forms. This is however no longer considered a valid subspecies and represents variation within the widely distributed species. 

The genus is the sole member of the tribe Hemiprocnini which is, based on one morphological cladistics, considered to be more derived than the Cypseloidini (while some others have suggested that &quot;Hemiprocne&quot; is basal) and basal to the Collocaliini and more derived tribes Chaeturini and Apodini. The posterior portion of the sternum has two openings or foramina and the fifth secondary is absent (also known as diastataxic, a character shared with &quot;Cypseloides&quot;) whereas other swifts have the fifth secondary (and are said to be eutaxic). Like all swifts this species uses saliva to build its nest but it does not have all the toes facing forward as in the Apodini.

==Distribution and habitat==

The crested treeswift is a common resident breeder from the Indian subcontinent. It is found in India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and China.
These are birds of open woodland and deciduous forests. They are also found in open areas near trees and in parks and gardens. Most birds live in the lowlands below 1000 m.

==Behaviour==
The crested treeswift builds a tiny and thin-walled and shallow nest made up of pieces of bark and feathers which is glued with saliva to the side of an exposed tree branch. It lays one blue-grey egg which is incubated by both sexes. The nest is so small that incubating birds may just appear as if just normally perched on a branch having a knot. Adults may also sit along the branch when incubating. Nearly half the egg is visible above the edge of the nest and is covered by the down feathers of their breast and belly when incubating. The breeding season is during the hottest part of summer from March to July and nests may be positioned on the eastern side of a branch so that the adult would have the sun on its back during the afternoon. Females were observed to incubate more while males sat nearby or captured insects. The nestlings are cryptically patterned in grey and freeze when threatened with the head held low and beak held slightly upward and appear like a knot on a tree branch or when sitting horizontally appear like a chameleon.

The crested treeswift feeds in the air, capturing insects (including honey bees) on the wing with its bill. They are known to sometimes roost communally.

==Status==
The crested treeswift has a very large range, the population size seems stable and it is considered relatively common. For these reasons, the IUCN has listed it as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

<text>James Eric Lloyd (born 17 July 1954) is an Australian former politician who served with the Liberal Party of Australia member of the Australian House of Representatives from the March 1996 election until the November 2007 election, representing the Division of Robertson in New South Wales.

==Biography==
Lloyd was born in Sydney and educated at Homebush Boys High School and worked in a variety of occupations, including milkman, ferry and cruise boat crew member, manager of a marina and service station proprietor before entering politics.

Lloyd was the Liberal Party candidate for the safe Labor seat of Peats at the 1984 New South Wales state election, gathering 33.40% of the vote. His lobbying work prior to entering politics included collecting 60,000 signatures which resulted in the re-opening of the Cheero Point section of the Pacific Highway, which had been closed for several years following landslides.

Lloyd was Chief Government Whip from 2001 to 2004 before his appointment as Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in July 2004. He was defeated in the 2007 election by Labor member Belinda Neal.

<doc id="577213" wikidata="Q1457247" url="?curid=577213" title="Assembly of First Nations">
<text>The Assembly of First Nations (, AFN) is an assembly of Canadian First Nations (Indian bands) represented by their chiefs. Established in 1982 and modelled on the United Nations General Assembly, it emerged from the National Indian Brotherhood, which dissolved in the late 1970s.

The aims of the organization are to protect and advance the aboriginal and treaty rights and interests of First Nations in Canada, including health, education, culture and language. It represents primarily status Indians.

The Métis and non-status Indians have organized in the same period as the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP). Reflecting changes in where Aboriginal peoples are living, it represents primarily urban Indians, including off-reserve status Indians and Inuit.

==History==

Indigenous peoples of North America have created a variety of political organizations. Examples preceding European contact include the Iroquois Confederacy, or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, the Blackfoot Confederacy, and Powhatan Confederacy in three different regions. There were other confederacies in New England, New York, and in the Southeast British colonies. Other groups formed later to enter into treaties with colonial governments led by ethnic French, Spanish and English.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of regional Indigenous organizations were formed in Canada, such as the Grand Indian Council of Ontario and Quebec, and the Allied Tribes of B.C. After World War II, additional provincial and territorial organizations were founded and continued to expand their memberships in an effort to assert their rights to land and to protect their cultures.

Indigenous activists under the leadership of controversial lawyer William Wuttunee from Red Pheasant First Nation founded the National Indian Council (NIC) in 1961 to represent their peoples of Canada, including treaty/status Indians, non-status Indians, and the Métis, though not the Inuit, who took a different path. This organization, however, collapsed in 1967 as the three groups failed to achieve consensus on their positions.

At the same time, other Indigenous activism was rising. Following the government&#x27;s publication of its 1969 White Paper, George Manuel, Noel Doucette, Andrew Delisle, Omer Peters, Jack Sark, Dave Courchene, Roy Sam, Harold Sappier, Dave Ahenakew, Harold Cardinal, and Roy Daniels founded and incorporated the National Indian Brotherhood in 1970. It was intended as an umbrella organization for the various provincial and territorial organizations of status Indians, such as the Indian Association of Alberta.

The Métis and non-status Indians set up a separate organization in 1971, known as the Native Council of Canada (NCC). It originally was made up of regional and provincial associations of these peoples. By the late 20th century, an increasing number of Aboriginal peoples were living in urban areas. With further development and led by Jim Sinclair, in 1993 it became the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP), representing urban and off-reserve Métis, non-status and status Indians. It also represents some Inuit.

===National Indian Brotherhood===
The National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) was a national political body made up of the leadership of the various provincial and territorial organizations (PTOs); it lobbied for changes to federal and provincial policies to support Indigenous rights and sovereignty.

The following year, the NIB launched its first major campaign, which opposed the assimilationist proposals of the 1969 White Paper. In that, the Minister of Indian Affairs, Jean Chrétien, had proposed abolition of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, rejection of Aboriginal land claims, and assimilation of First Nations people into the Canadian population, with the status of other ethnic minorities, who were largely descendants of immigrants, rather than as a distinct group reflecting Indigenous peoples history in North America.

Supported by a churches, labour, and other citizen groups, the NIB mounted massive opposition to the government plan. On June 3, 1970, the NIB presented the response by Harold Cardinal and the Indian Chiefs of Alberta (entitled &quot;Citizens Plus&quot; but commonly known as &quot;The Red Paper&quot;) to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and ministers of his Cabinet. Startled by the strong opposition to the White Paper, the Prime Minister told the delegation that the White Paper recommendations would not be imposed against their will.

In 1972, the NIB submitted their policy paper &quot;Indian Control of Indian Education&quot; to the federal government, which generally accepted this proposal to devolve control of Indigenous education to the bands and reserves. The NIB gained national recognition on the issue of Indigenous education in Canada. Their work contributed to the government&#x27;s ending the Canadian Residential School System, which had been long opposed by Indigenous people. It was also a first step in the push for Indigenous self-governance.

In 1973, the Calder case decision was issued. &quot;You have more rights than I thought you did,&quot; Prime Minister Trudeau told the NIB leaders.

The NIB gained consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 1974, until such time as an international Indigenous organization could be formed. When the World Council of Indigenous Peoples was formed on Nuu-chah-nulth territory the following year, under the leadership of George Manuel, it took the place of the NIB at the United Nations.

===Shift toward representation for chiefs===
The NIB began to have its own tensions. Individual chiefs and regional groupings begin to chafe because their only access to the national scene was through their respective PTOs. The chiefs complained they were not being heard.

In 1978, in an effort to enable more opinions to be heard, NIB President Noel Starblanket organized an &quot;All Chiefs Conference&quot; on &quot;Indian Self-Government&quot;. The Chiefs were delighted with the opportunity. At a second All Chief Conference, the Chiefs announced that the All Chief Conference would be &quot;the one and only voice of Indian people in Canada.&quot;

That same year Prime Minister Trudeau announced that Canada would patriate its constitution; essentially take over its governance. NIB and other groups questioned what would happen to the Treaty and aboriginal rights that had been guaranteed by the Imperial Crown, if Canada took over its own governance. They believed that strong national leadership from the Chiefs was essential. The Chiefs formalized their governance structure, compromised by incorporating a &quot;Confederacy&quot; composed largely of the NIB leadership, and made the NIB, an incorporated body, its administrative secretariat. They used the United Nations General Assembly as a model in conceiving how the new Assembly of First Nations would be structured and operate.

The Chiefs held their first assembly as &quot;the Assembly of First Nations&quot; (AFN) in Penticton, British Columbia, in April 1982. The new structure gave membership and voting rights directly to individual chiefs representing First Nations, rather than to representatives of their provincial/territorial organizations. This structure was adopted in July 1985, as part of the Charter of the Assembly of First Nations.

==Public perceptions==
The AFN depends upon the federal government for most of its funding. First Nations activists have sometimes accused it of being obsequious to the government as a result, and not sufficiently representative of the larger First Nations community. But there is also widespread Indigenous support for continued operation of the AFN.

In early 2013, the press reported that documents revealed that the AFN had been operating together with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to provide information and conduct surveillance on members of First Nations communities. This was in response to their joint concerns over disruptions due to mass protests over issues of sovereignty, land claims, and related tensions. Reporters acquired the documents through access to information requests. &quot;The Star&quot; reported that heads of the RCMP, and of the Ontario and Quebec provincial police met in the summer of 2007 with AFN national chief Phil Fontaine to &quot;facilitate a consistent and effective approach to managing Aboriginal protests and occupations.&quot;

<text>The Presidential Range is a mountain range in the Green Mountains of the U.S. state of Vermont. All of the summits of the peaks in the range are located in Addison County but the eastern slopes in the northern part of the range extend into Washington County. The major peaks in the range are named for several U.S. presidents from the period of the American Civil War through World War I.

All of the peaks in the Presidential Range are above and all but one are above . The highest peak in the range is Mount Abraham at , while the second highest peak is Mount Wilson at . Both peaks are among the one hundred highest peaks in New England.

==Description==

From north to south (which corresponds to the chronological order of the corresponding presidencies), the Presidential Range includes:

* Mount Abraham, , named after Abraham Lincoln, U.S. President, 1861–1865
* Mount Grant, , named after Ulysses S. Grant, U.S. President, 1869–1877
* Mount Cleveland, , named after Grover Cleveland, U.S. President, 1885–1889 and 1893–1897
* Mount Roosevelt, , named after Theodore Roosevelt, U.S. President, 1901–1909
* Mount Wilson, , named after Woodrow Wilson, U.S. President, 1913–1921

The three northernmost summits are in the town of Lincoln while the other two are in Ripton (all in Addison County). Except for Mount Abraham, the major peaks of the range are in the Breadloaf Wilderness in the Green Mountain National Forest. Mount Abraham is separated from the other peaks by Lincoln Gap, the highest vehicle-accessible mountain pass in Vermont.

==Drainage basin==

Most of Presidential Range lies within the watershed of Lake Champlain, which drains into the Richelieu River in Québec, the Saint Lawrence River, and then eventually into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Portions of Mount Roosevelt and Mount Wilson lie within the watershed of the Connecticut River, which drains into Long Island Sound in Connecticut.

==Trails==

The Long Trail, a hiking trail running the length of Vermont, traverses the major peaks of the Presidential Range. The trail enters the southern edge of the Breadloaf Wilderness at Middlebury Gap on Vermont Route 125 and winds northward along the ridge of the Green Mountains to Appalachian Gap on Vermont Route 17:








Apart from the Presidential Range, there are five peaks above on this section of the Long Trail. North of Mount Abraham, there are four such peaks: Lincoln Peak, Nancy Hanks Peak, Mount Ellen, and Stark Mountain. South of Mount Wilson, the only such peak is Bread Loaf Mountain.

Thru hikers traverse of trail between Mount Wilson and Mount Abraham. Along the way, four side trails provide access to the Long Trail (Emily Proctor Trail, Clark Brook Trail, Cooley Glen Trail, and Battell Trail) with limited off-road parking at each trailhead. There are three shelters on this section of the Long Trail: Emily Proctor Shelter, Cooley Glen Shelter, and Battell Shelter. Each shelter is at the intersection of the Long Trail and the corresponding side trail.

A popular day hike begins and ends where the Long Trail crosses Lincoln Gap Road in the town of Lincoln. From Lincoln Gap, the summit of Mount Abraham is north on the Long Trail. Alternatively, the Battell Trail, whose trailhead is also in Lincoln, terminates at the Battell Shelter after . From the shelter, the summit is north on the Long Trail.

The Emily Proctor Trail and the Cooley Glen Trail share the same trailhead. A popular loop hike begins and ends at this trailhead. The loop hike takes in three peaks of the Presidential Range: Mount Wilson, Mount Roosevelt, and Mount Cleveland. A fourth president, Mount Grant, is just off the main loop, north of the Cooley Glen Shelter on the Long Trail.

<text>Circular Quay railway station is a heritage-listed elevated railway station that is located on the City Circle line, serving the Circular Quay precinct of the Sydney central business district in New South Wales, Australia. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line, T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line and T8 Airport &amp; South Line services.

It is adjacent to the Circular Quay ferry wharf complex, which serves as an interchange to Sydney Ferries. It is also adjacent to Circular Quay light rail station which is the terminus of the L2 Randwick Line and L3 Kingsford Line of Sydney&#x27;s light rail network.

==History==

Circular Quay is an area of historical significance for Sydney, as it was for a long time the central harbour of a settlement which relied on shipping for its connection to the outside world. By the 20th century, ferry commuter wharves began to eclipse commercial shipping wharves as the dominant feature of the Quay area. The area became a transport hub as it served as the terminus of both ferry and tram services.

Planning for a railway station here to complement this transport hub began in 1909, and work was authorised in 1915. Tunnels to link the surrounding stations to the future Circular Quay station were built from Central between 1917 and 1926 to St James (eastern section) and 1932 to Wynyard (western section). Work on the section of the railway through Circular Quay began in 1936, was interrupted by World War II, and recommenced in 1945. Work was again interrupted between 1951 and 1953 with the viaduct finally completed in 1954. The supporting beams were fabricated at Chullora Railway Workshops in the 1930s. They were used during the construction of the Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge in the 1940s, before being returned to Chullora.
Designs for the station building itself commenced in 1927, revised in 1937, and the station was finally completed and opened on 20 January 1956 by State Premier Joseph Cahill, with the first regular train services beginning on 22 January. The completion of Circular Quay station marked the completion of the City Circle railway as originally envisaged by John Bradfield making it the newest station on the line.

The construction and placement of the station was always controversial due to its prominent location at the head of Circular Quay, an important natural and cultural landmark and visitors&#x27; attraction. When the Cahill Expressway opened above the station in 1958, the controversy over the entire structure only intensified. There have been various proposals to relocate the station underground in conjunction with the demolition of the Cahill Expressway, however these have not come to fruition.

Along with Central station, Circular Quay received one of the first easy access upgrades which included lift access prior to September 1998.

In 2006, RailCorp performed maintenance and cleaning of the station&#x27;s 50-year-old facade. A refurbishment in 2007 introduced sun-shading awnings on the platforms, removed advertising hoarding between the tracks, and improved facilities on the concourse level.

==Design==
Circular Quay station features a ground-level central concourse, and elevated platforms on a second level. Both platforms feature sections of open galleries, offering views to Circular Quay, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House on one side, and Customs House and the Alfred Street plaza on the other. Viaducts lead from the elevated platforms to tunnels through surrounding elevated terrain that lead to neighbouring stations.

The station has two main, double-storey facades, facing Circular Quay to the north, and Customs House to the south respectively. The northern facade is faced with polished granite tiles, while the southern one features polished granite and sandstone. The station name is featured in steel lettering on both sides. The upper storey of the facades correspond to the central sections of the platforms, and feature steel-framed windows. The exterior of the remainder of the platform feature open, glass-railed galleries, supported on the lower level by a continuation of the central facade. The top of the northern, harbour-facing facade is incorporated into the viewing platform and rest area located above the station alongside the Cahill Expressway roadway. This platform can be reached from the pedestrian walkway on the Cahill Expressway.

The station platforms are reached from the ground level concourse via stairs, escalators and lifts. The central concourse is surrounded on either side by retail and food shops and public toilets located under the elevated platforms. The concourse is decorated with brass details in an aquatic animal motif, seen in sculpted grills above stairways and doorways. Glass bricks are used extensively in various parts.

The station is in an inter-war functionalist style, as seen in the strong horizontal lines presented by the windows and galleries, with art deco details.

==Platforms and services==

==Transport links==
South-east of the railway station is the Alfred Street bus terminus. A number of Transdev John Holland routes originate from there while two Big Bus Tours routes depart from George Street just north of Alfred Street.

Adjacent to the station to the north lies Circular Quay wharf that is served by Captain Cook Cruises, Manly Fast Ferry and Sydney Ferries services.

West of the bus terminus and also at Alfred Street is the Circular Quay light rail stop, which is the northern terminus for the L2 Randwick and L3 Kingsford lines.

<text>Milton Arthur Paul Caniff (; February 28, 1907 – April 3, 1988) was an American cartoonist known for the &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; and &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; comic strips.

==Biography==
Caniff was born in Hillsboro, Ohio. He was an Eagle Scout and a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Caniff did cartoons for local newspapers while studying at Stivers High School (now Stivers School for the Arts) in Dayton Ohio. At Ohio State University, Caniff joined the Sigma Chi fraternity and later illustrated for &quot;The Magazine of Sigma Chi&quot; and &quot;The Norman Shield&quot; (the fraternity&#x27;s pledgeship/reference manual). Graduating in 1930, Caniff began at the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; where he worked with the noted cartoonists Billy Ireland and Dudley Fisher, but Caniff&#x27;s position was eliminated during the Great Depression. Caniff related later that he had been uncertain of whether to pursue acting or cartooning as a career and that Ireland said, &quot;Stick to your inkpots, kid, actors don&#x27;t eat regularly.&quot;

He died on April 3, 1988, and was buried in the Mount Repose Cemetery, Haverstraw, New York.

===Comic strips===
In 1932, Caniff moved to New York City to accept an artist job with the Features Service of the Associated Press. He did general assignment art for several months, drawing the comic strips &quot;Dickie Dare&quot; and &quot;The Gay Thirties&quot;, then inherited a panel cartoon named &quot;Mister Gilfeather&quot; in September 1932 when Al Capp quit the feature.

Caniff was also hired by his friend Bil Dwyer when Dwyer took over the Chic Young-created comic strip &quot;Dumb Dora&quot; in 1932, and needed help while learning the routines of a daily cartoon strip. Caniff ghost-wrote and drew a number of strips, working closely with Dwyer for the first year and a half of Dwyer&#x27;s tenure on the strip. While some critics claimed that Caniff was largely responsible for the strip&#x27;s quality at this time, Caniff himself took credit only for some of the art and none of the writing, calling Dwyer &quot;a good gag man.&quot;

Caniff continued &quot;Gilfeather&quot; until the spring of 1933, when it was retired in favor of a generic comedy panel cartoon called &quot;The Gay Thirties&quot;, which he produced until he left AP in the autumn of 1934. In July 1933, Caniff began an adventure fantasy strip, &quot;Dickie Dare&quot;, influenced by series such as &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Brick Bradford&quot;. The eponymous main character was a youth who dreamed himself into adventures with such literary and legendary persons as Robin Hood, Robinson Crusoe and King Arthur. In the spring of 1934, Caniff changed the strip from fantasy to &quot;reality&quot; when Dickie no longer dreamed his adventures but experienced them as he traveled the world with a freelance writer, Dickie&#x27;s adult mentor, &quot;Dynamite Dan&quot; Flynn.

====&quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;====

In 1934, Caniff was hired by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; to produce a new strip for the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. &quot;Daily News&quot; publisher Joseph Medill Patterson wanted an adventure strip set in the mysterious Orient, what Patterson described as &quot;the last outpost for adventure,&quot; Knowing almost nothing about China, Caniff researched the nation&#x27;s history and learned about families for whom piracy was a way of life passed down for generations. The result was &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, the strip which made Caniff famous. Like Dickie Dare, Terry Lee began as a boy who is traveling with an adult mentor and adventurer, Pat Ryan. But over the years the title character aged, and by World War II he was old enough to serve in the Army Air Force. During the 12 years that Caniff produced the strip, he introduced many fascinating characters, most of whom were &quot;pirates&quot; of one kind or another.

Introduced during the early days of the strip was Terry and Pat&#x27;s interpreter and manservant Connie. They were later joined by the mute Chinese giant Big Stoop. Both he and Connie provided the main source of comic relief. Other characters included: Burma, a blonde with a mysterious, possibly criminal, past; Chopstick Joe, a Chinese petty criminal; Singh Singh, a warlord in the mountains of China; Judas, a smuggler; Sanjak, a lesbian; and then boon companions such as Hotshot Charlie, Terry&#x27;s wing man during the War years; and April Kane, a young woman who was Terry&#x27;s first love.

But Caniff&#x27;s most memorable creation was the Dragon Lady, a pirate queen; she was seemingly ruthless and calculating, but Caniff encouraged his readers to think she had romantic yearnings for Pat Ryan.

====&quot;Male Call&quot;====

During the war, Caniff began a second strip, a special version of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; without Terry but featuring the blonde bombshell, Burma. Caniff donated all of his work on this strip to the armed forces—the strip was available only in military newspapers. After complaints from the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; about the military version of the strip being published by military newspapers in the Herald&#x27;s circulation territory, the strip was renamed &quot;Male Call&quot; and given a new star, Miss Lace, a beautiful woman who lived near every military base and enjoyed the company of enlisted men, whom she addressed as &quot;Generals&quot;. Her function, Caniff often said, was to remind service men what they were fighting for, and while the situations in the strip included much &#x27;double entendre&#x27;, Miss Lace was not portrayed as being promiscuous.

Much more so than civilian comic strips which portrayed military characters, &quot;Male Call&quot; was notable for its honest depiction of what the servicemen encountered; one strip displays Lace dating a soldier on leave who had lost an arm (she lost her temper when a civilian insulted him for that disability). Another strip had her dancing with a man in civilian clothes; a disgruntled GI shoved and mocked him for having an easy life, but Lace&#x27;s partner was in fact an ex-GI blinded in battle. Caniff continued &quot;Male Call&quot; until seven months after V-J Day, ending it in March 1946.

In 1946, Caniff ended his association with &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. While the strip was a major success, it was not owned by its creator but by its distributing syndicate, the Chicago Tribune-New York Daily News, a common practice with syndicated comics at the time. And when Caniff, growing more and more frustrated with the lack of rights to the comic strip he produced, was offered the chance to own his own strip by Marshall Field, publisher of the Chicago Sun, the cartoonist quit Terry to produce a strip for Field Enterprises. Caniff produced his last strip of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; in December 1946 and introduced his new strip &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; the following month. At the time, Caniff was one of only two or three syndicated cartoonists who owned their creations, and he attracted considerable publicity as a result of this circumstance.

====&quot;Steve Canyon&quot;====
Like his previous strip, &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; was an action strip with a pilot as its main character. Canyon was portrayed originally as a civilian pilot with his own one-airplane cargo airline, but he re-enlisted in the Air Force during the Korean War and remained in the Air Force for the remainder of the strip&#x27;s run.

While &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; never achieved the popularity that &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; had as a World War II military adventure, it was a successful comic strip with a greater circulation than &quot;Terry&quot; ever had. A short-lived &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; television series was produced in 1958. Steve Canyon was often termed the &quot;unofficial spokesman&quot; for the Air Force. The title character&#x27;s dedication to the military produced a negative reaction among readers during the Vietnam War, and the strip&#x27;s circulation decreased as a result. Caniff nonetheless continued to enjoy enormous regard in the profession and in newspapering, and he produced the strip until his death in 1988. The strip was published for a couple of months after he died, but was ended in June 1988, due to Caniff&#x27;s decision that no one else would continue the feature.

The character of Charlie Vanilla, who appeared frequently with an ice cream cone, was based on Caniff&#x27;s long-term friend Charles Russhon, a former photographer and Lieutenant in the US Air Force who later worked as a James Bond movie technical adviser. The character of Madame Lynx was based on Madame Egelichi, the femme fatale spy played by Ilona Massey in the 1949 Marx Brothers movie &quot;Love Happy&quot;. The character stirred Caniff&#x27;s imagination, and he hired Ilona Massey to pose for him. Caniff designed Pipper the Piper after John F. Kennedy and Miss Mizzou after Marilyn Monroe.

==Recognition and awards==
Caniff was one of the founders of the National Cartoonists Society and served two terms as its president, 1948 and 1949. He also received the Society&#x27;s first Cartoonist of the Year Award in 1947 for work published during 1946, which included both &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; and &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; as well. Caniff would be named Cartoonist of the Year again, receiving the accompanying trophy, the Reuben, in 1972 for 1971, again for &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;. He was awarded an Inkpot Award in 1974.

He was inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1988. He received the National Cartoonists Society Elzie Segar Award in 1971, the Award for Story Comic Strip in 1979 for &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, the Gold Key Award (the Society&#x27;s Hall of Fame) in 1981, and the NCS has since named the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in his honor.

In 1977, the Milton Caniff Collection of papers and original art became the foundation for what is known presently as the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum. Covering , the collection fills 526 boxes, plus 12,153 art originals and 59 oversized items. In addition to the original artwork, the collection includes Caniff&#x27;s personal and business papers, correspondence, research files, photographs, memorabilia, merchandise, realia, awards, audio/visual material and scrapbooks.

In 1987, he was made the first honorary member of the Eighth Air Force Historical Society in recognition for the &quot;Male Call&quot; strip that he did for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; during World War II.

==Influence==
Caniff died in New York City in 1988. Along with Hal Foster and Alex Raymond, Caniff&#x27;s style had a tremendous influence on the artists who drew American comic books and adventure strips during the mid-20th century. Evidence of his influence can be seen in the work of comic book/strip artists such as Jack Kirby, Frank Robbins, Lee Elias, Bob Kane, Mike Sekowsky, John Romita, Sr., Johnny Craig, William Overgard and Doug Wildey to name just a few. European artists were also influenced by his style, including Belgian artists Jijé, Hubinon and Italian artist Hugo Pratt.

The Caniff estate hired special effects artist John R. Ellis to restore for release the 34 episodes of the 1958–59 NBC television series &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; featuring Dean Fredericks in the title role.

==Caniff as comic character==
From 1995, Dargaud has published a series of Franco-Belgian comics, &quot;Pin-Up&quot;, intended mainly for adults, written by Yann Le Pennetier and drawn by Philippe Berthet. The series describes the adventures of artist&#x27;s model Dottie Partington during and after World War II. The strip features a number of real-life characters and situations, albeit in a fictional setting, including Gary Powers and the U-2 Crisis and Hugh Hefner. During World War II, Dottie is the model for Milton, an artist who has been commissioned to draw a strip to raise the morale of the troops. He creates &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;, a strip-within-a-strip, in which the titular character is a combination of Lace of &quot;Male Call&quot; and Mata Hari (though she fights with the Yanks against the Japanese). Milton is later shown working on &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;.

This version of Caniff is not a particularly sympathetic one, depicting him in a loveless marriage while obsessed with Dottie who has rejected him.

<doc id="577221" wikidata="Q912835" url="?curid=577221" title="1971 San Fernando earthquake">
<text>The 1971 San Fernando earthquake (also known as the 1971 Sylmar earthquake) occurred in the early morning of February 9 in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California. The unanticipated thrust earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5 on the scale and 6.6 on the scale, and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (&quot;Extreme&quot;). The event was one in a series that affected Los Angeles County during the late 20th century. Damage was locally severe in the northern San Fernando Valley and surface faulting was extensive to the south of the epicenter in the mountains, as well as urban settings along city streets and neighborhoods. Uplift and other effects affected private homes and businesses.

The event affected a number of health-care facilities in Sylmar, San Fernando, and other densely populated areas north of central Los Angeles. The Olive View Medical Center and Veterans Hospital both experienced very heavy damage, and buildings collapsed at both sites, causing the majority of deaths that occurred. The buildings at both facilities were constructed with mixed styles, but engineers were unable to thoroughly study the buildings&#x27; responses because they were not outfitted with instruments for recording strong ground motion; this prompted the Veterans Administration to later install seismometers at its high-risk sites. Other sites throughout the Los Angeles area had been instrumented as a result of local ordinances, and an unprecedented amount of strong motion data was recorded, more so than any other event up until that time. The success in this area spurred the initiation of California&#x27;s Strong Motion Instrumentation Program.

Transportation around the Los Angeles area was severely afflicted with roadway failures and the partial collapse of several major freeway interchanges. All 4,084 square miles of Los Angeles County were declared a disaster area by California Governor Ronald Reagan. The near-total failure of the Lower Van Norman Dam resulted in the evacuation of tens of thousands of downstream residents, though an earlier decision to maintain the water at a lower level may have contributed to saving the dam from being overtopped. Schools were affected, as they had been during the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, but this time amended construction styles improved the outcome for the thousands of school buildings in the Los Angeles area. Another result of the event involved the hundreds of various types of landslides that were documented in the San Gabriel Mountains. As had happened following other earthquakes in California, legislation related to building codes was once again revised, with laws that specifically addressed the construction of homes or businesses near known active fault zones.

== Tectonic setting ==
The San Gabriel Mountains are a long portion of the Transverse Ranges and are bordered on the north by the San Andreas Fault, on the south by the Cucamonga Fault, and on the southwest side by the Sierra Madre Fault. The San Bernardino, Santa Ynez, and Santa Monica Mountains are also part of the anomalous east–west trending Transverse Ranges. The domain of the ranges stretches from the Channel Islands offshore to the Little San Bernardino Mountains, to the east. The frontal fault system at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains extends from the San Jacinto Fault Zone in the east to offshore Malibu in the west, and is defined primarily by moderate to shallow north-dipping faults, with a conservative vertical displacement estimated at .

Paleomagnetic evidence has shown that the western Transverse Ranges were formed as the Pacific plate moved northward relative to the North American plate. As the plate shifted to the north, a portion of the terrane that was once parallel with the coast was rotated in a clockwise manner, which left it positioned in its east–west orientation. The Transverse Ranges form the perimeter of a series of basins that begins with the Santa Barbara Channel on the west end. Moving eastward, there is the Ventura Basin, the San Fernando Valley, and the San Gabriel Basin, with active reverse faults (San Cayetano, Red Mountain, Santa Susana, and Sierra Madre) all lining the north boundary. A small number of damaging events have occurred, with three in Santa Barbara (1812, 1925, and 1978) and two in the San Fernando Valley (1971 and 1994), though other faults in the basin that have high Quaternary slip rates have not produced any large earthquakes.

== Earthquake ==

The San Fernando earthquake occurred on February 9, 1971, at 6:00:41 am Pacific Standard Time (14:00:41 UTC) with a strong ground motion duration of about 12 seconds as recorded by seismometers, although the whole event was reported to have lasted about 60 seconds. The origin of faulting was located five miles north of the San Fernando Valley. Considerable damage was seen in localized portions of the valley and also in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains above the fault block. The fault that was responsible for the movement was not one that had been considered a threat, and this highlighted the urgency to identify other similar faults in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The shaking surpassed building code requirements and exceeded what engineers had prepared for, and although most dwellings in the valley had been built in the prior two decades, even modern earthquake-resistant structures sustained serious damage.

Several key attributes of the event were shared with the 1994 Northridge earthquake, considering both were brought about by thrust faults in the mountains north of Los Angeles, and each resulting earthquake being similar in magnitude, though no surface rupture occurred in 1994. Since both occurred in urban and industrial areas and resulted in significant economic impairment, each event drew critical observation from planning authorities, and has been thoroughly studied in the scientific communities.

=== Surface faulting ===
Prominent surface faulting trending N72°W was observed along the San Fernando Fault Zone from a point south of Sylmar, stretching nearly continuously for east to the Little Tujunga Canyon. Additional breaks occurred farther to the east that were in a more scattered fashion, while the western portion of the most affected area had less pronounced scarps, especially the detached Mission Wells segment. Although the complete Sierra Madre Fault Zone had previously been mapped and classified by name into its constituent faults, the clusters of fault breaks provided a natural way to identify and refer to each section. As categorized during the intensive studies immediately following the earthquake, they were labeled the Mission Wells segment, Sylmar segment, Tujunga segment, Foothills area, and the Veterans fault.

All segments shared the common elements of thrust faulting with a component of left-lateral slip, a general east–west strike, and a northward dip, but they were not unified with regard to their connection to the associated underlying bedrock. The initial surveyors of the extensive faulting in the valley, foothills, and mountains reported only tectonic faulting, while excluding fissures and other features that arose from the effects of compaction and landslides. In the vicinity of the Sylmar Fault segment, there was a low possibility of landslides due to a lack of elevation change, but in the foothills and mountainous area a large amount of landslides occurred and more work was necessary to eliminate the possibility of misidentifying a feature. Along the hill fronts of the Tujunga segment, some ambiguous formations were present because some scarps may have had influence from downhill motion, but for the most part they were tectonic in nature.

In repeated measurements of the different fault breaks, the results remained consistent, leading to the belief that most of the slip had occurred during the mainshock. While lateral, transverse, and vertical motions were all observed, the largest individual component of movement was of left lateral slip near the middle of the Sylmar segment. The largest cumulative amount of slip of occurred along the Sylmar and Tujunga segments. The overall fault displacement was summarized by geologist Barclay Kamb and others as &quot;nearly equal amounts of north–south compression, vertical uplift (north side up), and left lateral slip and hence may be described as a thrusting of a northern block to the southwest over a southern block, along a fault surface dipping about 45° north.&quot;

=== Landslides ===
The USGS commissioned a private company and the United States Air Force to take aerial photographs over of the mountainous areas north of the San Fernando Valley. Analysis revealed that the earthquake triggered over 1,000 landslides. Highly shattered rock was also documented along the ridge tops, and rockfalls (which continued for several days) were the result of both the initial shock and the aftershocks. Few of the slides that were logged from the air were also observed from the ground. The greatest number of slides were centered to the southwest of the mainshock epicenter and close to the areas where surface faulting took place. The slides ranged from in length, and could be further categorized as rock falls, soil falls, debris slides, avalanches, and slumps. The most frequently encountered type of slide was the surficial (less than thick) debris slides and were most often encountered on terrain consisting of sedimentary rock.

=== Strong motion ===
In early 1971, the San Fernando Valley was the scene of a dense network of strong-motion seismometers, which provided a total of 241 seismograms. This made the earthquake the most documented event, at the time, in terms of strong-motion seismology; by comparison, the 1964 Alaska earthquake did not provide any strong motion records. Part of the reason there were so many stations to capture the event was a 1965 ordinance that required newly constructed buildings in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles over six stories in height to be outfitted with three of the instruments. This stipulation ultimately found its way into the Uniform Building Code as an appendix several years later. One hundred seventy-five of the recordings came from these buildings, another 30 were on hydraulic structures, and the remainder were from ground-based installations near faults, including an array of the units across the San Andreas Fault.

The instrument that was installed at the Pacoima Dam recorded a peak horizontal acceleration of 1.25 &quot;g&quot;, a value that was twice as large as anything ever seen from an earthquake. The extraordinarily high acceleration was just one part of the picture, considering that duration and frequency of shaking also play a role in how much damage can occur. The accelerometer was mounted on a concrete platform on a granite ridge just above one of the arch dam&#x27;s abutments. Cracks formed in the rocks and a rock slide came within of the apparatus, and the foundation remained undamaged, but a small (half-degree) tilt of the unit was discovered that was apparently responsible for closing the horizontal pendulum contacts. As a result of what was considered a fortunate accident, the machine kept recording for six minutes (until it ran out of paper) and provided scientists with additional data on 30 of the initial aftershocks.

== Damage ==
The areas that were affected by the strongest shaking were the outlying communities north of Los Angeles that are bounded by the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. The unincorporated districts of Newhall, Saugus, and Solemint Junction had moderate damage, even to newer buildings. The area where the heaviest effects were present was limited by geographical features on the three remaining margins, with the Santa Susana Mountains on the west, the Santa Monica Mountains and the Los Angeles River to the south, and along the Verdugo Mountains to the east. Loss of life that was directly attributable to the earthquake amounted to 58 (a number of heart attacks and other health-related deaths were not included in this figure). Most deaths occurred at the Veterans and Olive View hospital complexes, and the rest were located at private residences, the highway overpass collapses, and a ceiling collapse at the Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles.

The damage was greatest near and well north of the surface faulting, and at the foot of the mountains. The hospital buildings, the freeway overpasses, and the Sylmar Juvenile Hall were on coarse alluvium that overlay thousands of feet of loosely consolidated sedimentary material. In the city of San Fernando, underground water, sewer, and gas systems suffered breaks too numerous to count, and some sections were so badly damaged that they were abandoned. Ground displacement damaged sidewalks and roads, with cracks in the more rigid asphalt and concrete often exceeding the width of the shift in the underlying soil. Accentuated damage near alluvium had been documented during the investigation of the effects of the 1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes. A band of similarly intense damage further away near Ventura Boulevard at the southern end of the valley was also identified as having been related to soil type.

Federal, county, and private hospitals suffered varying degrees of damage, with four major facilities in the San Fernando Valley suffering structural damage, and two of those collapsing. The Indian Hills Medical Center, the Foothill Medical Building, and the Pacoima Lutheran Professional building were heavily damaged. Nursing homes also were affected. The one-story Foothill Nursing Home sat very close to a section of the fault that broke the surface and was raised up three feet higher than the street. Scarps ran along the sidewalk and across the property. The building was not in use and remained standing. Though the reinforced concrete block structure was afflicted by the shock and uplift, the relatively good performance was in stark contrast to that of the Olive View and Veterans Hospital complexes.

=== Olive View Hospital ===
Most of the buildings at the Los Angeles County–owned, 880-bed hospital complex had been built before the adoption of new construction techniques that had been put in place after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. The group of one-story structures 300 feet west of the new facility, and some other buildings, were not damaged. The damaged buildings variously were wood-frame and masonry structures. The five-story, reinforced-concrete Medical Treatment and Care Building was one of three new additions to the complex (all three of which sustained damage), was assembled with earthquake-resistant construction techniques, and was completed in December 1970. The hospital was staffed by 98 employees and had 606 patients at the time of the earthquake; all three deaths that occurred at the Olive View complex were in this building. Two deaths were due to power failure of life-support systems and one employee was struck by part of the collapsing building while trying to exit the building.

The Medical Treatment and Care Building included a basement that was exposed (above grade) on the east and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade on the north side of the building, the variation being due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external staircases, could be considered five separate buildings, because the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building&#x27;s second through fifth floors consisted of shear walls, but a rarely used slip joint technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor kept them from being part of that system. Damage to the building, including ceiling tiles, telephone equipment, and elevator doors, was excessive at the basement and the first floor, with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. Because the first floor almost collapsed, the building was leaning to the north by almost two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.

On the grounds, there were cracks in the pavement and soil, but no surface faulting. In addition to the collapse of the stairways, the elevators were out of commission. Electrical power and communications failed at the hospital at the time of the earthquake, but very few people occupied the lower floors and the stairways at the early hour. Casualties in these highly affected areas might have increased had the shock occurred later in the day. The duration of strong ground motion at that location was probably similar to the 12 seconds observed at the Pacoima Dam, and it is thought that another few seconds&#x27; shaking might have been enough to bring the building to collapse.

=== Veterans Administration Hospital ===
The Veterans Administration Hospital entered into service as a tuberculosis hospital in 1926 and became a general hospital in the 1960s. By 1971, the facility comprised 45 individual buildings, all lying within of the fault rupture in Sylmar, but the structural damage was found to have occurred as a result of the shaking and not from ground displacement or faulting. Twenty-six buildings that were built prior to 1933 had been constructed following the local building codes and did not require seismic-resistant designs. These buildings suffered the most damage, with four buildings totally collapsing, which resulted in a large loss of life at the facility. Most of the masonry and reinforced concrete buildings constructed after 1933 withstood the shaking and most did not collapse, but in 1972 a resolution came forth to abandon the site and the remaining structures were later demolished, the site becoming a city park.

Few strong motion seismometer installations were present outside of the western United States prior to the San Fernando earthquake but, upon a recommendation by the Earthquake and Wind Forces Committee, the Veterans Administration entered into an agreement with the Seismological Field Service (then associated with NOAA) to install the instruments at all VA sites in Uniform Building Code zones two and three. It had been established that these zones had a higher likelihood of experiencing strong ground acceleration, and the plan was made to furnish the selected VA hospitals with two instruments. One unit would be installed within the structure and the second would be set up as a free-field unit located a short distance away from the facility. As of 1973, a few of the highest risk (26 were completed in zone 3 alone) sites that had been completed were in Seattle, Memphis, Charleston, and Boston.

=== Van Norman Dam ===

Both the Upper and Lower Van Norman Dams were severely damaged. The lower dam was very close to breaching, and approximately 80,000 people were evacuated for four days while the water level in the reservoir was lowered. This was done as a precaution to accommodate further collapse due to a strong aftershock. Some canals in the area of the dams were damaged and not usable, and dikes experienced slumping but these did not present a hazard. The damage at the lower dam consisted of a landslide that dislocated a section of the embankment. The earthen lip of the dam fell into the reservoir and brought with it the concrete lining, while what remained of the dam was just above the water level. The upper lake subsided and was displaced about as a result of the ground movement, and the dam&#x27;s concrete lining cracked and slumped.

The upper dam was constructed in 1921 with the hydraulic fill process, three years after the larger lower dam, which was fabricated using the same style. An inspection of the lower dam in 1964 paved the way towards an arrangement between the State of California and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power that would maintain the reservoir&#x27;s water level that was reduced 10 feet lower than was typical. Since the collapse of the dam lowered its overall height, the decision to reduce its capacity proved to be a valuable bit of insurance.

Differential ground motion and strong shaking (MMI VIII (&quot;Severe&quot;)) were responsible for serious damage to the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility and the Sylmar Converter Station (both located close to the Upper Van Norman lake). The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, as well as the County of Los Angeles, investigated and verified that local soil conditions contributed to the ground displacement and resulting destruction. The area of surface breaks on the ground at the site was (at its widest) and stretched down a 1% grade slope towards the southwest. As much as of lateral motion was observed on either end of the slide, and trenches that were excavated during the examination at the site revealed that some of the cracks were up to deep. The two facilities, located near Grapevine and Weldon canyons that channel water and debris off the Sierra Madre Mountains, are lined by steep ridges and have formed alluvial fans at their mouths. The narrow band of ground disturbances were found to have been the result of settling of the soft soil in a downhill motion. Soil liquefaction played a role within confined areas of the slide, but it was not responsible for all the motion at the site, and tectonic slip of faults in the area was also excluded as a cause.

=== Transportation ===
Substantial disruption to about 10 miles of freeways in the northern San Fernando Valley took place, with most of the damage occurring at the Foothill Freeway / Golden State Freeway interchange, and along a five-mile stretch of Interstate 210. On Interstate 5, the most significant damage was between the Newhall Pass interchange on the north end and the I-5 / I-405 interchange in the south, where subsidence at the bridge approaches and cracking and buckling of the roadway made it unusable. Several landslides occurred between Balboa Boulevard and California State Route 14, but the most significant damage occurred at the two major interchanges. The Antelope Valley Freeway had damage from Newhall Pass to the northeast, primarily from settling and alignment issues, as well as splintering and cracking at the Santa Clara River and Solemint bridges.

;Golden State Freeway – Antelope Valley Freeway Interchange

While the Newhall Pass interchange was still under construction, the requisite components of the overpass were complete. Vibration caused two of the bridge&#x27;s 191-foot sections to fall from a maximum height of , along with one of the supporting pillars. The spans slipped off of their supports at either end due to lack of proper ties and insufficient space (a seat was provided) on the support columns. Ground displacement at the site was ruled out as a major cause of the failure, and in addition to the fallen sections and a crane that was struck during the collapse, other portions of the overpass were also damaged. Shear cracking occurred at the column closest to the western abutment, and the ground at the same column&#x27;s base exhibited evidence of rotation.

;Golden State Freeway – Foothill Freeway Interchange

This interchange is a broad complex of overpasses and bridges that was nearly complete at the time and not all portions were open to traffic. Several instances of failure or collapse at the site took place and two men were killed while driving in a pickup truck as a result. The westbound I-210 to southbound I-5, which was complete except for paving at the ramp section, collapsed to the north, likely because of vibration that moved the overpass off its supports due to an inadequate seat. Unlike the situation at the Antelope Valley Interchange, permanent ground movement (defined as several inches of left-lateral displacement with possibly an element of thrusting) was observed in the area. The movement contributed to heavy damage at the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility, Sylmar Converter Station, and the Metropolitan Water District Treatment Plant, but its effects on the interchange was not completely understood as of a 1971 report from the California Institute of Technology.

=== Schools ===
A large number of public school buildings in the Los Angeles area displayed mixed responses to the shaking, and those that were built after the enforcement of the Field Act clearly showed the results of the reformed construction styles. The Field Act was put into effect just one month following the destructive March 1933 Long Beach earthquake that damaged many public school buildings in Long Beach, Compton, and Whittier. The Los Angeles Unified School District had 660 schools consisting of 9,200 buildings, with 110 masonry buildings that had not been reinforced to meet the new standards. More than 400 portable classrooms and 53 wood frame pre-Field Act buildings were also in use. All these buildings had been previously inspected with regard to the requirements of the Act, and many were reinforced or rebuilt at that time, but earthquake engineering experts recommended further immediate refurbishment or demolition after a separate evaluation was done after the February 1971 earthquake, and within a year and a half the district followed through with the direction with regard to about 100 structures.

At Los Angeles High School ( from Pacoima Dam) where the exterior walls of the main pre-Field Act building (constructed 1917) were unreinforced brick masonry, long portions of the parapet and the associated brick veneer broke off and some fragments fell through the roof to a lower floor, while other material landed on an exit stairway and into a courtyard area. The main building was demolished at a cost of $127,000, and none of the various post-Field Act buildings were damaged at the site. Except for the concrete gymnasium, all of the buildings at Sylmar High School ( from Pacoima Dam) were post-Field Act, one-story, wood construction. Abundant cracks formed in the ground at the site, and some foundations and many sidewalks were also cracked. The estimate for repairs at the site was $485,000. At , Hubbard Street Elementary School was the closest school to Pacoima Dam and was also less than a mile from the Veterans Hospital complex. The wood-frame buildings (classrooms, a multipurpose building, and some bungalows) were built after the Field Act, and damage and cleanup costs there totaled $42,000. Gas lines were broken and separation of the buildings&#x27; porches was due to lateral displacement of up to six inches.

== Aftermath ==
Following many of California&#x27;s major earthquakes, lawmakers have acted quickly to develop legislation related to seismic safety. After the M6.4 1933 Long Beach earthquake, the Field Act was passed the following month, and after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act and Senate Bill 1953 (hospital safety requirements) were established. Following the San Fernando event, earthquake engineers and seismologists from established scientific organizations, as well as the newly formed Los Angeles County Earthquake Commission, stated their recommendations that were based on the lessons learned. The list of items needing improvements included building codes, dams and bridges being made more earthquake resistant, hospitals that are designed to remain operational, and the restriction of development near known fault zones. New legislation included the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act and the development of the Strong Motion Instrumentation Program.

Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act
Introduced as Senate Bill 520 and signed into law in December 1972, this legislation was originally known as the Alquist-Priolo Geologic Hazard Zones Act, and had the goal of reducing damage and losses due to surface fault ruptures or fault creep. The act restricts construction of buildings designed for human occupancy across potentially active faults. Since it is presumed that surface rupture will likely take place where past surface displacement has occurred, the state geologist was given the responsibility for evaluating and mapping faults that had evidence of Holocene rupture, and creating regulatory zones around them called Earthquake Fault Zones. State and local agencies (as well as the property owner) were then responsible for enforcing or complying with the building restrictions.

California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program

Prior to the San Fernando earthquake, some structural engineers had already believed that the existing groundwork for seismic design required enhancement. Although instruments had recorded a force of 0.33 &quot;g&quot; during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, building codes only required structures to withstand a lateral force of 0.1 &quot;g&quot; as late as the 1960s. Even at that time, engineers were against the idea of constructing buildings to resist the high forces that were seen in the El Centro shock, but after a 1966 earthquake peaked at 0.5 &quot;g&quot;, and a maximum of 1.25 &quot;g&quot; was observed at the Pacoima Dam during the San Fernando event, a debate began as to whether that low requirement was sufficient.

Despite the compelling seismogram from the 1940 event in El Centro, strong-motion seismology was not explicitly sought until later events occurred—the San Fernando earthquake made evident the need for more data for earthquake engineering applications. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and ground response stations. By the late 1980s, the program had instrumented more than 450 structures, bridges, dams, and power plants. The 1979 Imperial Valley and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were presented as gainful events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully instrumented government building that was shaken to the point of failure.

<text>Mount Marcy is the highest point in the Adirondack Mountains and the U.S. state of New York, with an elevation of . It is located in the town of Keene in Essex County. The mountain is in the heart of the High Peaks Wilderness Area in Adirondack Park. Like the surrounding Adirondack Mountains, Marcy was heavily affected by large glaciers during recent ice ages, which deposited boulders on the mountain slopes and carved valleys and depressions on the mountain. One such depression is today filled by Lake Tear of the Clouds, which is often cited as the highest source of the Hudson River. The majority of the mountain is covered by hardwood and spruce-fir forests, although the highest few hundred feet are above the tree line. The peak is dominated by rocky outcrops, lichens, and alpine plants. The mountain supports a diverse number of woodland mammals and birds.

Mount Marcy&#x27;s stature and expansive views make it a popular destination for hikers, who crowd its summit in the summer months. Multiple approaches to the summit are available from the north and south, with the most popular route being the Van Hoevenberg Trail. The first recorded ascent of the mountain was made by a party led by Ebenezer Emmons on August 5, 1837, who named it after New York governor William L. Marcy. One of the mountain&#x27;s most notable ascents was made in 1901, when Theodore Roosevelt climbed it with his family, and learned during his descent that William McKinley was dying and he was to become President of the United States.

== Name ==
The mountain was known as &quot;Wah-um-de-neg&quot;, meaning &quot;always white&quot;, in the Missisquoi Abenaki Tribe. Another Abenaki name for it and the surrounding mountains was &quot;Wawobadenik&quot;, meaning &quot;white mountains&quot;. The contemporary name Mount Marcy was provided by Ebenezer Emmons following his ascent of the mountain in August 1837. The mountain is named after William L. Marcy, the 19th-century Governor of New York, who authorized the environmental survey that explored the area. In September 1837, the area was visited by poet and author Charles Fenno Hoffman, who proposed the alternative name &quot;Tahawus&quot;, a Seneca term which has been translated as &quot;cloud-splitter&quot; or &quot;he splits the sky&quot;. The alternative name became popular during the 19th century, and the nearby village at Lower Works was renamed Tahawus in 1847. Many New Yorkers advocated for it to become the official name. A misconception arose that this was an original indigenous name for the peak, although there is no documented use of it prior to Hoffman.

== Geography ==
Mount Marcy is the highest point in New York, the highest peak in the Adirondack Mountains, and the highest of the Adirondack High Peaks, with an elevation of . The mountain is located in the High Peaks Wilderness Area, in the town of Keene in Essex County. Three shorter peaks are located on the flanks of Marcy: Gray Peak to the west, Little Marcy to the northeast, and an unnamed peak to the northwest. Lake Tear of the Clouds, at the col between Mounts Marcy and Skylight, is often cited as the highest source of the Hudson River. Between Mount Marcy and Mount Haystack lies Panther Gorge. A large rock slide on the southern slope of the mountain, now called the Old Slide, was incorporated into the first cut trail to the summit, which approached from Panther Gorge.

=== Geology ===
Mount Marcy is composed of anorthosite rock formed approximately 1.1 billion years ago. During the Pleistocene Epoch, large glaciers formed across the Adirondack Mountains, carving new valleys and depositing erratic rocks across the mountains. The last glacial retreat of the Pleistocene occurred 12,000 years ago. Numerous cirques were left on the mountain slopes by water as it repeatedly froze and thawed, including a depression on the northeast slope known as the snowbowl, and another on the south slope which has now been filled by Lake Tear of the Clouds. The mountain, along with the surrounding Adirondack region, is currently rising at a rate of 2-3 millimeters per year.

== History ==
The earliest recorded ascent of Mount Marcy was on August 5, 1837, by a large party led by state geologist Ebenezer Emmons measuring the highest peaks in the region. Interest in recreational climbs of the mountain increased after 1849, when mountain guide Orson Schofield Phelps moved to the area. Phelps would ascend the mountain over 100 times and cut the first two trails to the peak.

Surveying teams led by Verplanck Colvin made several important ascents of Mount Marcy in the 1870s. Colvin&#x27;s team measured the mountain&#x27;s elevation by leveling in 1875, and a signal tower was erected at the summit in 1877. After observing the effects of deforestation during his travels in the Adirondacks, Colvin proposed the creation of a park in the mountains. Most of the Adirondack region, including Mount Marcy, had been sold to private landowners shortly after the American Revolution. In 1922, the state of New York acquired the land containing the summit to add to the state forest preserve.

Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was on a vacation in the Adirondacks when President William McKinley was shot by an assassin on September 6, 1901. Roosevelt rushed to Buffalo to see the president, but believed he would recover and resumed his trip. On September 13, when it became clear McKinley was dying, Roosevelt was staying at Tahawus, and spent the morning ascending Mount Marcy with his family. A messenger had to be dispatched to deliver the news and reached the party at Lake Tear of the Clouds during their descent. They hiked back to their lodge, where Roosevelt hired a stage coach to take him to the North Creek train station. There, Roosevelt was informed that McKinley had died, and the new president took the train to Buffalo to be sworn in. The route from Long Lake to North Creek has been designated as the Roosevelt-Marcy Trail.

Marcy&#x27;s popularity as a hiking destination has steadily increased in recent decades, conflicting with the goal of keeping the mountain and the surrounding area as wilderness. The number of registered visitors at trailheads in the High Peaks Wilderness increased from 57,016 in 1988 to 139,663 in 1998, prompting the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to formulate the High Peaks Unit Management Plan in March 1999. A 2021 study by Otak observed significant crowds on the summit of the mountain on popular summer days.

== Routes ==

The shortest and most frequently used route up the mountain is from the northwest on the Van Hoevenberg Trail. The trail starts at the Adirondak Loj near Heart Lake and proceeds to the summit. Marcy Dam is located on the route from the trailhead along with campsites. This route involves a gain of in elevation from the trailhead to summit. Portions of the trail can be used for alpine skiing in the winter.

A second ascent route approaches from the northeast, via the Phelps Trail in Johns Brook Valley, which merges with the Van Hoevenberg Trail shortly before the peak. Beginning at the Garden parking lot in Keene Valley, this route is to the summit. The Johns Brook Lodge, the closest lodging to the mountain, is located from the trailhead. This route involves a gain of in elevation. The mountain can also be ascended at the end of the Great Range Trail, which begins at the Rooster Comb trailhead in Keene Valley. This route is much more challenging and crosses the summits of the Great Range before merging with the Van Hoevenberg Trail, for a total distance of one way and of cumulative elevation gain.

A lengthier southern approach can be made from the Upper Works trailhead via the Calamity Brook Trail. The route passes Lake Colden and Lake Tear of the Clouds on the way to the summit, and can also be used for skiing in the winter. This approach is to the summit and there several campsites along the route. Less commonly, a southern approach can be made from the Elk Lake parking lot on the Elk Lake-Marcy Trail. This trail crosses private land and is closed during the big-game hunting season. The route is to the summit and involves a gain of of elevation. A lean-to is available for camping at Panther Gorge, located from the trailhead. The two southern routes meet at the Four Corners intersection at the col between Mounts Marcy and Skylight, from which both peaks can be accessed.

On clear days, 43 of the other 45 High Peaks are visible from the peak of Marcy. Lake Champlain can be seen to the east, and Mount Royal in Quebec can be seen to the north, away.

== Climate ==
Mount Marcy has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) as defined by the Köppen climate classification system, closely bordering on subarctic.

== Ecology ==

=== Flora ===

The lower slopes of Mount Marcy are covered by hardwood forests containing American beech, sugar maple, and yellow birch trees. The upper slopes contain balsam fir and red spruce. Above an elevation of , only the balsam fir grows. The cold and windy climate near the summit creates a krummholz zone with short, crooked trees and large areas of exposed rock where no plants can take root, although lichens will grow on the rocks.

About near the summit is covered by alpine tundra vegetation where trees cannot grow, a remnant of the tundra ecosystem which covered the entire region at the end of the last ice age and retreated uphill as the climate warmed. This small ecosystem is primarily covered by sphagnum moss and is home to other alpine plants, including alpine bilberry, cottongrass, Labrador tea, Lapland rosebay, and leatherleaf. Botanist Edwin Ketchledge conducted an ecological study of the summits in the late 1960s and concluded the alpine plants were being destroyed by litter and trampling from hikers, after which habitat restoration projects were carried out in the 1970s. The Summit Steward program was established to educate hikers against wandering off the trails and to mark the trails to the summit with cairns. A long term study between 1957 and 1981 found that away from the hiking trails and direct human impact, the alpine ecosystem was stable over long periods of time.

=== Fauna ===
A variety of birds can be found in the spruce-fir forests of the upper slopes, including black-backed woodpeckers, golden-crowned kinglets, and white-winged crossbills, as well as mammals such as pine martens, porcupines, and red squirrels. Despite the harsh climate, the summit of Marcy is still home to many animals. Birds that frequent the alpine zone of the High Peaks include common ravens, dark-eyed juncos, white-throated sparrows, winter wrens, and several species of warbler. Mammals that live in the alpine zone include American ermines, long-tailed shrews, and snowshoe hares. The alpine meadows support pollinating insects, and bees, butterflies, flies, and wasps can be found in the summer. Several species of leafhopper have been identified, some of which are endemic to alpine environments.

<doc id="577231" wikidata="Q4708326" url="?curid=577231" title="Alapana">
<text>In Carnatic classical music, alapana is a form of manodharmam, or improvisation, that introduces and develops a raga (musical scale). It communicates the permitted notes and phrases of the raga, setting the mood for the composition that follows. As a term that is Sanskrit in language, alapana means &quot;to speak, address, discourse, communicate&quot;. It is the first part of Ragam Tanam Pallavi (RTP), which showcases a Carnatic musician&#x27;s ability to understand a raga and improvise music set to it. 

== Overview ==
The flavor of the raga is outlined in the alapana by rendering the raga&#x27;s permitted notes in structures and phrases unique to the raga (known as &quot;raga lakshanam&quot;). Alapana typically precedes a song that is going to be sung in the same raga. It demonstrates proper knowledge of the raga by highlighting key phrases common to it. Alapana is rendered in different speeds, with a gradual increase in tempo. Likewise, the complexity of the patterns increases steadily as the alapana progresses.

Alapana, also referred to as ragam, is the exposition of a raga or tone. It is a slow improvisation with no rhythm, where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment. In performing alapana, performers consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and consists somehow of sequences of thought.

In a Carnatic concert, the alapana introducing a major composition may last 45 minutes or more, while those preceding other compositions are proportionately shorter. Performers and instrumental accompanists often render the alapana together and individually (for example, vocalist&#x27;s phrases are shadowed by that of a violinist, and later the violinist may perform solo).

Raga Alapana is divided into three parts: akshipthika, ragavardhini, and magarini.

== Three Parts of Raga Alapana ==

=== Akshipthika ===
In Carnatic music, the Akshipthika is the first part or the introductory part of the alapana. It gives an idea about the raga (musical mode) in which the song is going to be sung. It is followed by the ragavardhini. Akshipthika is the introduction to the raga. It usually starts on a low note in the scale but then again the artist is permitted to start wherever they want on the scale and at whatever tempo they want. We must remember that the idea of raga alapana is to allow the musician to creatively express themselves and the raga without sticking to a particular scaffold as they must in a song. Thus, there is no particular order or manner in which it must be performed.

=== Ragavardhini ===
Ragavardhini is a major part of the alapana of a raga. The performer gives a step-by-step elaboration of the raga, pausing at each major note or swara.

=== Magarini ===
Magarini is the concluding section of the alapana. The artist sings brisks passages scaling across the entire range of raga.

<doc id="577235" wikidata="Q942440" url="?curid=577235" title="James–Younger Gang">
<text>The James–Younger Gang was a notable 19th-century gang of American outlaws that revolved around Jesse James and his brother Frank James. The gang was based in the state of Missouri, the home of most of the members.

Membership fluctuated from robbery to robbery, as the outlaws&#x27; raids were usually separated by many months. As well as the notorious James brothers, at various times it included the Younger brothers (Cole, Jim, John, and Bob), John Jarrett (married to the Youngers&#x27; sister Josie), Arthur McCoy, George Shepherd, Oliver Shepherd, William McDaniel, Tom McDaniel, Clell Miller, Charlie Pitts, William Chadwell (alias Bill Stiles), and Matthew &quot;Ace&quot; Nelson.

The James–Younger Gang had its origins in a group of Confederate bushwhackers that participated in the bitter partisan fighting that wracked Missouri during the American Civil War. After the war, the men continued to plunder and murder, though the motive shifted to personal profit rather than in the name of the Confederacy. The loose association of outlaws did not truly become the &quot;James–Younger Gang&quot; until 1868 at the earliest, when the authorities first named Cole Younger, John Jarrett, Arthur McCoy, George Shepherd and Oliver Shepherd as suspects in the robbery of the Nimrod Long bank in Russellville, Kentucky.

The James–Younger Gang dissolved in 1876, following the capture of the Younger brothers in Minnesota during the unsuccessful attempt to rob the Northfield First National Bank. Three years later, Jesse James organized a new gang, including Clell Miller&#x27;s brother Ed and the Ford brothers (Robert and Charles), and renewed his criminal career. This career came to an end in 1882 when Robert Ford shot Jesse James from behind, killing him.

For nearly a decade following the Civil War, the James–Younger Gang was among the most feared, most publicized, and most wanted confederations of outlaws on the American frontier. Though their crimes were reckless and brutal, many members of the gang commanded a notoriety in the public eye that earned the gang significant popular support and sympathy. The gang&#x27;s activities spanned much of the central part of the country; they are suspected of having robbed banks, trains, and stagecoaches in at least eleven states: Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and West Virginia.

==History==
===Origins===
From the beginning of the American Civil War, the state of Missouri had chosen not to secede from the Union but neither to fight for it nor against it: its position, as determined by an 1861 constitutional convention, was officially neutral. Missouri, however, had been the scene of much of the agitation leading up to the outbreak of the war, and was home to dedicated partisans from both sides. In the mid-1850s, local Unionists and Secessionists had begun to battle each other throughout the state, and by the end of 1861, guerrilla warfare erupted between Confederate partisans known as &quot;bushwhackers&quot; and the more organized Union forces. The Missouri State Guard and the newly elected Governor of Missouri, Claiborne Fox Jackson, who maintained implicit Southern sympathies, were forced into exile as Union troops under Nathaniel Lyon and John C. Frémont took control of the state. Still, pro-Confederate guerrillas resisted; by early 1862, the Unionist provisional government mobilized a state militia to fight the increasingly organized and deadly partisans. This conflict (fought largely, though not exclusively, between Missourians themselves) raged until after the fall of Richmond and the surrender of General Robert E. Lee, costing thousands of lives and devastating broad swathes of the Missouri countryside.

The conflict rapidly escalated into a succession of atrocities committed by both sides. Union troops often executed or tortured suspects without trial and burned the homes of suspected guerrillas and those suspected of aiding or harboring them. Where credentials were suspect, the accused guerrilla was often executed, as in the case of Lt. Col. Frisby McCullough after the Battle of Kirksville. Bushwhackers, meanwhile, frequently went house to house, executing Unionist farmers.

The James and Younger brothers belonged to families from an area known as &quot;Little Dixie&quot; in western Missouri with strong ties to the South. Zerelda Samuel, the mother of Frank and Jesse James, was an outspoken partisan of the South, though the Youngers&#x27; father, Henry Washington Younger, was believed to be a Unionist. Cole Younger&#x27;s initial decision to fight as a bushwhacker is usually attributed to the death of his father at the hands of Union forces in July 1862. He and Frank James fought under one of the most famous Confederate bushwhackers, William Clarke Quantrill, though Cole eventually joined the regular Confederate Army. Jesse James began his guerrilla career in 1864, at the age of sixteen, fighting alongside Frank under the leadership of Archie Clement and &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson.

At the war&#x27;s end, Frank James surrendered in Kentucky; Jesse James attempted to surrender to Union militia but was shot through the lung outside of Lexington, Missouri. He was nursed back to health by his cousin, Zerelda &quot;Zee&quot; Mimms, whom he eventually married. When Cole Younger returned from a mission to California, he learned that Quantrill and Anderson had both been killed. The James brothers, however, continued to associate with their old guerrilla comrades, who remained together under the leadership of Archie Clement. It was likely Clement who, amid the tumult of Reconstruction in Missouri, turned the guerrillas into outlaws.

===Early years: 1866 to 1870===
On February 12, 1866, a group of gunmen carried out one of the first daylight, peacetime, armed bank robberies in U.S. history when they held up the Clay County Savings Association in Liberty, Missouri. The outlaws stole some $60,000 in cash and bonds and killed a bystander named George Wymore on the street outside the bank. State authorities suspected Archie Clement of leading the raid, and promptly issued a reward for his capture. In later years, the list of suspects grew to include Jesse and Frank James, Cole Younger, John Jarrett, Oliver Shepherd, Bud and Donny Pence, Frank Greg, Bill and James Wilkerson, Joab Perry, Ben Cooper, Red Mankus, and Allen Parmer (who later married Susan James, Frank and Jesse&#x27;s sister).

Four months later, on June 13, 1866, two members of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders were freed from prison in Independence, Missouri; the jailer, Henry Bugler, was killed. The James brothers are believed to have been involved. The gang began a string of robberies, many of which were linked to Clement&#x27;s group of bushwhackers. The hold-up most clearly linked to the group was of Alexander Mitchell and Company in Lexington, Missouri, on October 30, 1866, which netted $2,011.50. Clement was also linked to violence and intimidation against officials of the Republican government that now held power in the state. On election day, Clement led his men into Lexington, where they drove Republican voters away from the polls, thereby securing a Republican defeat. A detachment of state militiamen was dispatched to the town. They convinced the bushwhackers to disperse, then attempted to capture Clement, who still had a price on his head. Clement refused to surrender and was shot down in a wild gunfight on the streets of Lexington.

Despite the death of Clement, his old followers remained together, and robbed a bank across the Missouri River from Lexington in Richmond, Missouri, on May 22, 1867, in which the town mayor John B. Shaw and two lawmen [Barry and George Griffin] were killed. This was followed on March 20, 1868, by a raid on the Nimrod Long bank in Russellville, Kentucky. In the aftermath of the two raids, however, the more senior bushwhackers were killed, captured or simply left the group. This set the stage for the emergence of the James and Younger brothers, and the transformation of the old crew into the James–Younger Gang. John Jarrett and Arthur McCoy were mentioned in numerous newspaper accounts, so they were likely active in gang activities up to 1875.

On December 7, 1869, Frank and Jesse James are believed to have robbed the Daviess County Savings Association in Gallatin, Missouri. Jesse is suspected of having shot down the cashier, John W. Sheets, in the mistaken belief that he was Samuel P. Cox, the Union militia officer who had ambushed and killed &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson during the Civil War. The James brothers were unknown up to this point; this may have been their first robbery. Their names were later added to previous robberies as an afterthought.

===1871 to 1873===

John Younger was almost arrested in Dallas County, Texas in January 1871. He killed two lawmen [Nichols and Mcmahan] during the attempt and escaped. On June 3, 1871, the gang robbed a bank in Corydon, Iowa; the James and Younger brothers were suspects. The bank contacted the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in Chicago, the first involvement of the famous agency in the pursuit of the James–Younger Gang. Agency founder Allan Pinkerton dispatched his son, Robert Pinkerton, who joined a county sheriff in tracking the gang to a farm in Civil Bend, Missouri. A short gunfight ended indecisively as the gang escaped. On June 24, Jesse James wrote a letter to the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot;, claiming Republicans were persecuting him for his Confederate loyalties by accusing him and Frank of carrying out the robberies. &quot;But I don&#x27;t care what the degraded Radical party thinks about me,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I would just as soon they would think I was a robber as not.&quot;

On April 29, 1872, the gang robbed a bank in Columbia, Kentucky. One of the outlaws shot the cashier, R. A. C. Martin, who had refused to open the safe. On September 23, 1872, three men (identified by former bushwhacker Jim Chiles as Jesse James and Cole and John Younger) robbed a ticket booth of the Second Annual Kansas City Industrial Exposition, amid thousands of people. They took some $900, and accidentally shot a little girl in the ensuing struggle with the ticket-seller. Apart from Chiles&#x27; testimony, there is no other evidence this crime was committed by the James or Younger brothers, and Jesse later wrote a letter denying his or the Youngers&#x27; involvement. Cole was furious over this, because neither he nor brother John had been linked to the crime before the letter. The crime was praised by &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; editor John Newman Edwards in a famous editorial entitled, &quot;The Chivalry of Crime.&quot; Edwards soon published an anonymous letter from one of the outlaws (believed to be Jesse) that referred to the approaching presidential election: &quot;Just let a party of men commit a bold robbery, and the cry is hang them. But [President Ulysses S.] Grant and his party can steal millions and it is all right,&quot; the outlaw wrote. &quot;They rob the poor and rich, and we rob the rich and give to the poor.&quot;

On May 27, 1873, the James–Younger Gang robbed the Ste. Genevieve Savings Association in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. As they rode off they fired in the air and shouted, &quot;Hurrah for Hildebrand!&quot; Samuel S. Hildebrand was a famous Confederate bushwhacker from the area who had recently been shot dead in Illinois. Arthur McCoy had lived in this area and knew it quite well; he was likely involved and may have been the planner and leader.

On July 21, 1873, the gang carried out what was arguably the first train robbery west of the Mississippi River, derailing a locomotive of the Rock Island Railroad near Adair, Iowa. Engineer John Rafferty died in the crash. The outlaws took $2,337 from the express safe in the baggage car, having narrowly missed a transcontinental express shipment of a large amount of cash.

On November 24, John Newman Edwards published a lengthy glorification of the James brothers, Cole and John Younger, and Arthur McCoy, in a twenty-page special supplement to his newspaper the &quot;St. Louis Dispatch&quot; (Edwards had moved from the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; to the &quot;Dispatch&quot; in 1873). Most of the supplement, entitled &quot;A Terrible Quintet,&quot; was devoted to Jesse James, the gang&#x27;s public face, and the article stressed their Confederate loyalties.

===1874 to 1876===
In January 1874, the outlaws were suspected of holding up a stagecoach in Bienville Parish, Louisiana. Later another suspected stage robbery took place between Malvern and Hot Springs, Arkansas. There, the gang returned a pocket watch to a Confederate veteran, saying that Northern men had driven them to outlawry and that they intended to make them pay for it. On January 31, the gang robbed a southbound train on the Iron Mountain Railway at Gads Hill, Missouri. For the first of two times in all their train robberies, the outlaws robbed the passengers. In both train robberies, their usual target, the safe in the baggage car belonging to an express company, held an unusually small amount of money. On this occasion, the outlaws reportedly examined the hands of the passengers to ensure that they did not rob any working men. Many newspapers reported this was actually done by the &quot;Arthur McCoy&quot; gang. To correct errors, the gang telegraphed a report of the Gads Hill robbery to the &quot;St. Louis Dispatch&quot; newspaper for publication.
The Adams Express Company, which owned the safe robbed at Gads Hill, hired the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. On March 11, 1874, Joseph W. Whicher, the agent who was sent to investigate the James brothers, was found shot to death alongside a rural road in Jackson County, Missouri. Two other agents, John Boyle and Louis J. Lull, accompanied by Deputy Sheriff Edwin B. Daniels to track the Youngers, posed as cattle buyers. On March 17, 1874, the trio was stopped and attacked by John and Jim Younger on a rural stretch of road near Monegaw Springs, Missouri. Daniels was killed instantly, Lull and John Younger shot and killed each other, while Boyle and Jim Younger escaped. Lull lived long enough to testify before a coroner&#x27;s inquest before succumbing to his wounds a few days later.

The Pinkerton deaths added to the growing embarrassment suffered by Missouri&#x27;s first post-war Democratic governor, Silas Woodson. He issued a $2,000 reward offer for the Iron Mountain robbers (the reward usually offered for criminals was $300). He also persuaded the state legislature to provide $10,000 for a secret fund to track down the famous outlaws. The first agent, J. W. Ragsdale, was hired on April 9, 1874. On August 30, three of the gang held up a stagecoach across the Missouri River from Lexington, Missouri, in view of hundreds of onlookers on the bluffs of the town. A passenger identified two of the robbers as Frank and Jesse James. The acting governor, Charles P. Johnson, dispatched an agent selected from the St. Louis police department to investigate.

The gang was observed during this period by William Eleroy Curtis, a journalist-turned-hostage. Curtis interviewed his captors, who allowed him to send dispatches to the &quot;Chicago Inter-Ocean&quot;.

The gang next robbed a train on the Kansas Pacific Railroad near Muncie, Kansas, on December 8, 1874. It was one of the outlaws&#x27; most successful robberies, gaining them $30,000. William &quot;Bud&quot; McDaniel was captured by a Kansas City police officer after the robbery, and later was shot during an escape attempt.

On the night of January 25, 1875, Pinkerton agents surrounded the James farm in Kearney, Missouri. Frank and Jesse James had been there earlier but had already left. When the Pinkertons threw an iron incendiary device into the house, it exploded when it rolled into a blazing fireplace. The blast nearly severed the right arm of Zerelda Samuel, the James boys&#x27; mother (the arm had to be amputated at the elbow that night), and killed their 9-year-old half-brother, Archie Samuel. On April 12, 1875, an unknown gunman shot dead Daniel Askew, a neighbor and former Union militiaman who may have been suspected of providing the Pinkertons with a base for their raid. Allan Pinkerton then abandoned the chase for the James–Younger Gang.

By September 1875, at least part of the gang had ventured east to Huntington, West Virginia, where they robbed a bank on September 7. Two new members participated: Tom McDaniel (brother of Bud) and Tom Webb (a Confederate veteran who had been at Lawrence with Frank and Cole). McDaniel was killed by a posse and Webb was caught. The other two robbers, Frank and Cole, escaped.

Also in 1875, the two James brothers moved to the outskirts of Nashville, Tennessee, probably to save their mother from further raids by detectives. Once there, Jesse James began to write letters to the local press, asserting his place as a Confederate hero and a martyr to Radical Republican vindictiveness.

On July 7, 1876, Frank and Jesse James, Cole and Bob Younger, Clell Miller, Charlie Pitts, Bill Chadwell and Hobbs Kerry robbed the Missouri Pacific Railroad at the &quot;Rocky Cut&quot; near Otterville, Missouri. The new man, Kerry, was arrested soon after and he readily identified his accomplices.

===Northfield, Minnesota Raid===

The Rocky Cut raid set the stage for the final act of the James–Younger Gang: the famous Northfield, Minnesota raid on September 7, 1876. The target was the First National Bank of Northfield, which was far outside the gang&#x27;s usual territory. The idea for the raid came from Jesse and Bob Younger. Cole tried to talk his brother out of the plan, but Bob refused to back down. Reluctantly, Cole agreed to go, writing to his brother Jim in California to come home. Jim Younger had never wanted anything to do with Cole&#x27;s outlaw activities, but he agreed to go out of family loyalty. The Northfield bank was not unusually rich. According to public reports, it was a perfectly ordinary rural bank, though rumors persisted that General Adelbert Ames, son of the owner of the Ames Mill in Northfield, had deposited $50,000 there.

Shortly after the robbery, Bob Younger declared that they had selected it because of its connection to two Union generals and Radical Republican politicians: Benjamin Butler and his son-in-law Adelbert Ames. General Ames had just stepped down as Governor of Mississippi, where he had been strongly identified with civil rights for freedmen. He had recently moved to Northfield, where his father owned the mill on the Cannon River and had a large amount of stock in the bank. One of the outlaws &quot;had a spite&quot; against Ames, Bob said. Cole Younger said much the same thing years later and recalled greeting &quot;General Ames&quot; on the street in Northfield just before the robbery.

Cole, Jim and Bob Younger, Frank and Jesse James, Charlie Pitts, Clell Miller and Bill Chadwell took the train to St. Paul, Minnesota, in early September 1876. After a layover in St. Paul they divided into two groups, one going to Mankato, the other to Red Wing, on either side of Northfield. They purchased expensive horses and scouted the terrain around the towns, agreeing to meet south of Northfield along the Cannon River near Dundas on the morning of September 7, 1876. The gang attempted to rob the bank about 2:00 p.m. on September 7. Northfield residents had seen the gang leave a local restaurant near the mill shortly after noon, where they dined on fried eggs. They testified at the Younger brothers&#x27; trial that the group smelled of alcohol and that the gang was obviously under the influence when they greeted General Ames.

Three of the outlaws (Bob Younger, Frank James and Charlie Pitts) crossed the bridge by the Ames Mill and entered the bank; the other five (Jesse James, Cole and Jim Younger, Bill Stiles and Clell Miller) stood guard outside. Two were standing outside the bank&#x27;s front door and the other three were waiting in Mills Square to guard the gang&#x27;s escape route. According to some reports, J. S. Allen shouted to the townspeople, “Get your guns, boys, they’re robbing the bank!” Once local citizens realized a robbery was in progress, several took up arms from local hardware stores. Shooting from behind cover, they poured deadly fire on the outlaws. During the gun battle, medical student Henry Wheeler killed Miller, shooting from a third-floor window of the Dampier House Hotel, across the street from the bank. Another civilian named A. R. Manning, who took cover at the corner of the Sciver building down the street, killed Stiles. Other civilians wounded the Younger brothers (Cole was shot in his left hip, Bob suffered a shattered elbow, and Jim was shot in the jaw). The only civilian fatality on the street was 30-year-old Nicholas Gustafson, an unarmed recent Swedish immigrant, who was killed by Cole Younger at the corner of 5th Street and Division.

Thirteen Swedish families lived west of Northfield in the Millersburg area in 1876, including Peter Gustafson, who had recently been joined by his brother Nicolaus and nephew Ernst from Sweden. West of Millersburg that morning, Peter Youngquist harnessed his mules and headed for Northfield to sell farm produce, accompanied by Gustafson and three others. The Swedes arrived in Northfield about 1:00 p.m. and set up their vegetable wagon along the Cannon River near 5th Street. About 2:00 p.m., they heard gunshots. Nicolaus Gustafson ran to the intersection of Division and 5th a block away, where he was shot in the head as the bank was being robbed. Gustafson died four days later. Another Swede named John Olson was an eyewitness to the Gustafson shooting and later testified against Cole Younger.

Inside the bank, the assistant cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe and was murdered for resisting. The two other employees in the bank were teller Alonzo Bunker and assistant bookkeeper Frank Wilcox. Bunker escaped from the bank by running out the back door despite being wounded in the right shoulder by Pitts as he ran. The three robbers then ran out of the bank after hearing the shooting outside and mounted their horses to make a run for it, having taken only several bags of nickels from the bank. Every year in September, Northfield hosts &quot;Defeat of Jesse James Days&quot;, a celebration of the town&#x27;s victory over the James–Younger Gang.

In addition to the death of Miller and Stiles, every one of the rest of the gang was wounded, including Frank James and Pitts, both shot in their right legs. Jesse James was the last one to be shot, taking a bullet in the thigh as the gang escaped. The six surviving outlaws rode out of town on the Dundas Road toward Millersburg where four of them had spent the night before.

===Aftermath===
Minnesotans joined posses and set up picket lines by the hundreds. After several days the gang had only reached the western outskirts of Mankato when they decided to split up (despite persistent stories to the contrary, Cole Younger told interviewers that they all agreed to the decision). The Youngers and Pitts remained on foot, moving west, until finally they were cornered in a swamp called Hanska Slough, just south of La Salle, Minnesota, on September 21, two weeks after the Northfield raid. In the gunfight that followed, Pitts was killed and the Youngers were again wounded. The Youngers surrendered and pleaded guilty to murder in order to avoid execution. Frank and Jesse secured horses and fled west across southern Minnesota, turning south just inside the border of the Dakota Territory. In the face of hundreds of pursuers and a nationwide alarm, Frank and Jesse escaped, but the infamous James–Younger Gang was no more.

On September 23, 1876, the Younger brothers were taken to the Rice County jail in Faribault. On November 16, a grand jury issued four indictmentsone each for the first-degree murders of Joseph Heywood and Nicolaus Gustafson, one for bank robbery, and one for assault with deadly weapons on the wounded bank clerk, Bunker. The three brothers pleaded guilty on November 20, 1876, and were sentenced to life terms in the Minnesota Territorial Prison at Stillwater.

Nicolaus Gustafson was buried in Northfield because the Millersburg Swedes had no cemetery in 1876. After his death, the Millersburg Swedes determined to establish their own church and burial ground. Peter Youngquist and Carl Hirdler donated an acre of land adjacent to their homes overlooking Circle Lake and in 1877 John Olson was hired to build the Christdala Evangelical Swedish Lutheran Church west of Millersburg. Today the church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and historical markers in front of the church tell the story of Nicolaus Gustafson and the founding of Christdala.

==Final years==

Having escaped, Frank James joined Jesse in Nashville, Tennessee, where they spent the next three years living peacefully. Frank in particular seemed to have thrived in his new life farming in the Whites Creek area. Jesse did not adapt well to peace; he gathered up recruits, formed a new gang and returned to a life of crime. On October 8, 1879, Jesse and his gang robbed the Chicago and Alton Railroad near Glendale, in Jackson County, Missouri. Unfortunately for Jesse, one of the men, Tucker Basham, was captured by a posse. He told authorities he had been recruited by Bill Ryan.

On September 3, 1880, Jesse James and Bill Ryan robbed a stagecoach near Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. On October 5, 1880, they robbed the store of John Dovey in Mercer, Kentucky. On March 11, 1881, Jesse, Ryan, and Jesse&#x27;s cousin Wood Hite robbed a federal paymaster at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, taking $5,240. Shortly afterward, a drunk and boastful Ryan was arrested in Whites Creek, near Nashville, and both Frank and Jesse James fled back to Missouri.
On July 15, 1881, Frank and Jesse James, Wood and Clarence Hite, and Dick Liddil robbed the Rock Island Railroad near Winston, Missouri, of $900. Train conductor William Westfall and passenger John McCullough were killed. On September 7, 1881, Jesse James carried out his last train robbery, holding up the Chicago and Alton Railroad. The gang held up the passengers when the express safe proved to be nearly empty.
With this new outbreak of train robberies, the new Governor of Missouri, Thomas T. Crittenden, convinced the state&#x27;s railroad and express executives to put up the money for a large reward for the capture of the James brothers. Creed Chapman and John Bugler were arrested for participating in the robbery on September 7, 1881. Though they were confirmed as having participated in the robbery by convicted members of the gang, neither was ever convicted.
In December 1881, Wood Hite was killed by Liddil in an argument over Martha Bolton, the sister of the Fords. Bob Ford, not yet a member of the gang, assisted Liddil in his gunfight. Ford and Liddil, with Bolton as an intermediary, made deals with Governor Crittenden. On February 11, 1882, James Timberlake arrested Wood Hite&#x27;s brother Clarence, who made a confession but died of tuberculosis in prison. Ford, on the other hand, agreed to bring down Jesse James in return for the reward.

On April 3, 1882, Ford fatally shot Jesse James behind the ear at James&#x27;s rented apartment in St. Joseph, Missouri. Bob and his brother Charley surrendered to the authorities, pleaded guilty, and were promptly pardoned by Crittenden. On October 4, 1882, Frank James surrendered to Crittenden. Accounts say that Frank surrendered with the understanding that he would not be extradited to Northfield, Minnesota. Only two cases ever came to trial: one in Gallatin, Missouri, for the July 15, 1881, robbery of the Rock Island Line train at Winston, Missouri in which a train crewman and a passenger were killed, and one in Huntsville, Alabama, for the March 11, 1881, robbery of a United States Army Corps of Engineers payroll at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Frank James was found not guilty by juries in both cases (July 1883 at Gallatin and April 1884 at Huntsville). Missouri kept jurisdiction over him with other charges but they never came to trial and they kept him from being extradited to Minnesota. Frank James died on February 8, 1915, at the age of 72.

The Youngers remained loyal to the Jameses when they were in prison and never informed on them. They ended up being model prisoners and in one incident helped keep other prisoners from escaping during a fire at the prison. Cole Younger also founded the longest-running prison newspaper in the United States during his stay at the Minnesota Territorial Prison in Stillwater. Bob Younger died in prison of tuberculosis on September 15, 1889, at the age of 36. After much legal dispute, Cole and Jim Younger were paroled in 1901 on the condition they remain in Minnesota. Jim committed suicide on October 19, 1902, while on parole in St. Paul, at the age of 54. Cole Younger received a pardon in 1903 on the condition that he leave Minnesota and never return. He traveled to Missouri where he joined a &quot;Wild West&quot; show with Frank James and died there on March 21, 1916, at the age of 72.

==Legacy==
Bill Ayers and Diana Oughton headed a splinter group of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) that called itself the &quot;Jesse James Gang&quot; and evolved into the Weather Underground.

<text>In an internal combustion engine, forced induction is where turbocharging or supercharging is used to increase the density of the intake air. Engines without forced induction are classified as naturally aspirated.

== Operating principle ==
=== Overview ===
Forced induction is often used to increase the power output of an engine. This is achieved by compressing the intake air, to increase the mass of the air-fuel mixture present within the combustion chamber. A naturally aspirated engine is limited to a maximum intake air pressure equal to its surrounding atmosphere; however a forced induction engine produces &quot;boost&quot;, whereby the air pressure is higher than the surrounding atmosphere. Since the density of air increases with pressure, this allows a greater mass of air to enter the combustion chamber.

Theoretically, the vapour power cycle analysis of the second law of thermodynamics would suggest that increasing the mean effective pressure within the combustion chamber would also increase the engine&#x27;s thermal efficiency. However, considerations (such as cooling the combustion chamber, preventing engine knock and limiting NOx exhaust emissions) can mean that forced induction engines are not always more fuel efficient, particularly in the case of high-performance engines.

=== Diesel engines ===
Four-stroke diesel engines are well suited to forced induction, since the lack of fuel in the intake air means that higher compression ratios can be used without a risk of pre-ignition. Therefore, the use of turbochargers on diesel engines is relatively commonplace.

Two-stroke diesel engines have a significantly different operating principle to two-stroke petrol engines, and require some form of forced induction - generally a supercharger - in order to function.

=== High altitude uses ===
A reduced density of intake air is caused by the loss of atmospheric density seen with elevated altitudes. Therefore, an early use of forced induction was in aircraft engines. At , the air is at half the pressure of sea level, which means that an engine without forced induction would produce less than half the power at this altitude. Forced induction is used to artificially increase the density of the intake air, in order to reduce the loss of power at higher altitudes.

Systems that use a turbocharger to maintain an engine&#x27;s sea-level power output are called &quot;turbo-normalized&quot; systems. Generally, a turbo-normalized system attempts to maintain a manifold pressure of .

== Types of compressors ==

The most commonly used forced-induction devices are turbochargers and superchargers. A turbocharger drives its compressor using a turbine powered by the flow of exhaust gases, whereas a supercharger is mechanically powered by the engine (usually using a belt from the engine&#x27;s crankshaft).

== Associated technologies ==
Intercooling is often used to reduce the temperature of the intake air after it is compressed. Another less commonly used method is water injection (or methanol injection).

<doc id="577240" wikidata="Q2224750" url="?curid=577240" title="Alap">
<text>The Alap (; ) is the opening section of a typical North Indian classical performance. It is a form of melodic improvisation that introduces and develops a raga. In dhrupad singing the alap is unmetered, improvised (within the raga) and unaccompanied (except for the tanpura drone), and started at a slow tempo.
For people unfamiliar with the raga form, it introduces the thaat to the listener. It defines the raga, its mood, and the emphasized notes and notes with a secondary role.

Instead of wholly free improvisation, many musicians perform alap schematically, for example by way of &quot;vistar&quot;, where the notes of the raga are introduced one at a time, so that phrases never travel further than one note above or below what has been covered before. In such cases, the first reach into a new octave can be a powerful event.

In instrumental music, when a steady pulse is introduced into the alap, it is called jor; when the tempo has been greatly increased, or when the rhythmic element overtakes the melodic, it is called jhala (dhrupad: &quot;nomtom&quot;). The jor and jhala can be seen as separate sections of the performance, or as parts of the alap; in the same way, jhala can be seen as a part of jor.

== Classifications ==
Several musicologists have proposed much more complicated classifications and descriptions of alap. In the same way as traditional four-part compositions have a &quot;sthai&quot;, &quot;antara&quot;, &quot;sanchar&quot; and &quot;abhog&quot;, some treat alap with a four-part scheme using the same names. Bengali researcher Bimalakanto Raychoudhuri in his &quot;Bharatiya Sangeetkosh&quot; suggests classification both by length (&quot;aochar&quot; being the shortest, followed by &quot;bandhan&quot;, &quot;kayed&quot; and &quot;vistar&quot;) and by performance style (according to the four ancient &quot;vanis&quot; or singing styles – &quot;Gohar&quot;, &quot;Nauhar&quot;, &quot;Dagar&quot; and &quot;Khandar&quot;), and proceeds to list thirteen stages:

# &quot;Vilambit&quot;
# &quot;Madhya laya&quot;
# &quot;Drut&quot;
# &quot;Jhala&quot;
# &quot;Thok&quot;
# &quot;Lari/Ladi&quot;
# &quot;Larguthav&quot;
# &quot;Larlapet&quot;
# &quot;Paran&quot;
# &quot;Sath&quot;
# &quot;Dhuya&quot;
# &quot;Matha&quot;
# &quot;Paramatha&quot;

Even though Raychoudhuri admits the 13th stage is wholly extinct, as we see we are in jhala already at the fourth stage; the sthai-to-abhog movement is all part of the first stage (vilambit). Stages six and up are for instrumentalists only. Other authorities have forwarded other classifications. For example, when alap is sung with lyrics or at least syllables, as in dhrupad, it is called &quot;sakshar&quot; as opposed to &quot;anakshar&quot;.

<doc id="577248" wikidata="Q1469453" url="?curid=577248" title="New riddle of induction">
<text>The new riddle of induction was presented by Nelson Goodman in &quot;Fact, Fiction, and Forecast&quot; as a successor to Hume&#x27;s original problem. It presents the logical predicates grue and bleen which are unusual due to their time-dependence. Many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but Hilary Putnam and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as &quot;green&quot;. For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are law-like and which are not. Goodman&#x27;s construction and use of &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in conceptual analysis.

==Grue and bleen==

Goodman defined &quot;grue&quot; relative to an arbitrary but fixed time &quot;t&quot;: an object is grue if and only if it is observed before &quot;t&quot; and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is &quot;bleen&quot; if and only if it is observed before &quot;t&quot; and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.

For some arbitrary future time &quot;t&quot;, say January 1, 10, for all green things observed prior to &quot;t&quot;, such as emeralds and well-watered grass, both the predicates &quot;green&quot; and &quot;grue&quot; apply. Likewise for all blue things observed prior to &quot;t&quot;, such as bluebirds or blue flowers, both the predicates &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; apply. On January 2, 10, however, emeralds and well-watered grass are &quot;bleen&quot;, and bluebirds or blue flowers are &quot;grue&quot;. The predicates &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; are not the kinds of predicates used in everyday life or in science, but they apply in just the same way as the predicates &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; up until some future time &quot;t&quot;. From the perspective of observers before time &quot;t&quot; it is indeterminate which predicates are future projectible (&quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot;).

==The new riddle of induction==
In this section, Goodman&#x27;s new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; and thereby illustrate their philosophical importance.

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses Hume&#x27;s problem of induction as a problem of the validity of the predictions we make. Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, there is no objective justification for these predictions. Deductive logic cannot be used to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences. Hume&#x27;s answer was that observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind). Predictions are then based on these regularities or habits of mind.

Goodman takes Hume&#x27;s answer to be a serious one. He rejects other philosophers&#x27; objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification. His view is that Hume has identified something deeper. To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a system of rules of deduction. For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice. The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences. Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman. However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations. It is with this turn that &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; have their philosophical role in Goodman&#x27;s view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===

The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish &quot;lawlike&quot; from &quot;non-lawlike&quot; generalizations. &quot;Lawlike&quot; generalizations are capable of confirmation while &quot;non-lawlike&quot; generalizations are not. &quot;Lawlike&quot; generalizations are required for making predictions. Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not &quot;lawlike&quot; but accidental. The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity. The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

The question, therefore, is what makes some generalizations &quot;lawlike&quot; and others accidental. This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in &quot;lawlike&quot; generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem is known as Goodman&#x27;s paradox: from the apparently strong evidence that all emeralds examined thus far have been green, one may inductively conclude that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is &quot;lawlike&quot; or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction. Goodman observed that (assuming &quot;t&quot; has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is &quot;grue&quot;. Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be &quot;grue&quot;. The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; from non-projectible predicates such as &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot;.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem. We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. &quot;Lawlike&quot; predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman&#x27;s solution is to argue that &quot;lawlike&quot; predictions are based on projectible predicates such as &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; and not on non-projectible predicates such as &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; and what makes predicates projectible is their &quot;entrenchment&quot;, which depends on their successful past projections. Thus, &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; function in Goodman&#x27;s arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
One response is to appeal to the artificially disjunctive definition of grue. The notion of predicate &quot;entrenchment&quot; is not required. Goodman said that this does not succeed. If we take &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; as primitive predicates, we can define green as &quot;&quot;grue&quot; if first observed before &quot;t&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; otherwise&quot;, and likewise for blue. To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to beg the question.

Another proposed resolution that does not require predicate &quot;entrenchment&quot; is that &quot;&quot;x&quot; is grue&quot; is not solely a predicate of &quot;x&quot;, but of &quot;x&quot; and a time &quot;t&quot;—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time &quot;t&quot;, but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect &quot;&quot;x&quot; is grue&quot; to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why &quot;&quot;x&quot; is green&quot; is &quot;not&quot; considered a predicate of a particular time &quot;t&quot;—the more common definition of &quot;green&quot; does not require any mention of a time &quot;t&quot;, but the definition &quot;grue&quot; does. Goodman also addresses and rejects this proposed solution as question begging because &quot;blue&quot; can be defined in terms of &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot;, which explicitly refer to time.

===Swinburne===
Richard Swinburne gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, &quot;can&quot; be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of &quot;x&quot; to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like &quot;grue&quot;, &quot;cannot&quot; be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of &quot;x&quot; to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether &quot;x&quot; is being observed before or after time &quot;t&quot;. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot;, this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas &quot;grue&quot; is merely locational. He concludes that if some &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time &quot;t&quot; shall appear grue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.

===Carnap===
Rudolf Carnap responded to Goodman&#x27;s 1946 article. Carnap&#x27;s approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of &quot;degree of confirmation&quot; &quot;c&quot;(&quot;h&quot;,&quot;e&quot;) of a given hypothesis &quot;h&quot; by a given evidence &quot;e&quot;. Both &quot;h&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are logical formulas expressed in a simple language &quot;L&quot; which allows for
* multiple quantification (&quot;for every &quot;x&quot; there is a &quot;y&quot; such that ...&quot;),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation &quot;=&quot;.
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions (&quot;like space-time points in our actual world&quot;) rather than extended physical bodies. A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe. Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other. In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals. Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components. Apparently, Carnap had in mind an irreflexive, partial, and well-founded order &quot;is simpler than&quot;.
* The set of primitive predicates in &quot;L&quot; must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in &quot;L&quot;.
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let &quot;x&quot; be a variable and &quot;a&quot; a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be &quot;&quot;x&quot; is blue or &quot;x&quot; is non-warm&quot;, an example of 2. &quot;&quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;, and an example of 3. &quot;x&quot; is red and not &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;.

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman&#x27;s notion of projectibility of a property &quot;W&quot; as follows: the higher the relative frequency of &quot;W&quot; in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property &quot;W&quot;. Carnap suggests &quot;as a tentative answer&quot; to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.

===Quine===
Willard Van Orman Quine discusses an approach to consider only &quot;natural kinds&quot; as projectible predicates.
He first relates Goodman&#x27;s grue paradox to Hempel&#x27;s raven paradox by defining two predicates &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim &quot;each &quot;F&quot; is a &quot;G&quot;&quot;. Then Hempel&#x27;s paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as &quot;is a raven&quot;, and &quot;is black&quot;) need not be projectible, while Goodman&#x27;s paradox shows that &quot;is green&quot; is projectible, but &quot;is grue&quot; is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of &quot;similarity&quot;. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a &quot;natural kind&quot;, but grue emeralds are not. Quine investigates &quot;the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind&quot;. Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. identity, negation, disjunction. However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to &quot;similarity&quot; or &quot;kind&quot;; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.


Relation between similarity and kind

Assuming finitely many &quot;kinds&quot; only, the notion of &quot;similarity&quot; can be defined by that of &quot;kind&quot;: an object &quot;A&quot; is more similar to &quot;B&quot; than to &quot;C&quot; if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; belong jointly to more kinds than &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; do.

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define &quot;kind&quot; by &quot;similarity&quot;. Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed &quot;paradigmatical&quot; red object than this is to another fixed &quot;foil&quot; non-red object (cf. left picture) isn&#x27;t satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness. (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by Carnap defines a natural kind to be a set whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.
However, Goodman argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind, while &quot;surely it is not what anyone means by a kind&quot;.

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if &quot;A&quot; is reassessed to be more similar to &quot;C&quot; than to &quot;B&quot; rather than the other way around, the assignment of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.

Basic importance of similarity and kind

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things referred to. Learning to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects. This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances. Already Heraclitus&#x27; famous saying &quot;No man ever steps in the same river twice&quot; highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

Genesis of similarity and kind

In a behavioral sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity. It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alienness to mathematics and logic, cf. bird example.

==== Habit formation ====
Induction itself is essentially animal expectation or habit formation. Ostensive learning is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man&#x27;s spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor&#x27;s. In contrast, the &quot;brute irrationality of our sense of similarity&quot; offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made. Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical problem of induction. Quine, following Watanabe, suggests Darwin&#x27;s theory as an explanation: if people&#x27;s innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through natural selection. However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one&#x27;s spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book &quot;Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language&quot;, Saul Kripke proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed &quot;Kripkenstein&quot; by some) of the private language argument. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called &quot;quus&quot;, which is identical with &quot;+&quot; in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::formula_1

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant &quot;+&quot;, I had not actually meant &quot;quus&quot;. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of Wittgenstein as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

<doc id="577251" wikidata="Q217323" url="?curid=577251" title="24p">
<text>In video technology, 24p refers to a video format that operates at 24 frames per second (typically, 23.976 frame/s when using equipment based on NTSC frame rates, but now 24.000 in many cases) frame rate with progressive scanning (not interlaced). Originally, 24p was used in the non-linear editing of film-originated material. Today, 24p formats are being increasingly used for aesthetic reasons in image acquisition, delivering film-like motion characteristics. Some vendors advertise 24p products as a cheaper alternative to film acquisition.

When working entirely within the digital non-linear domain, 24p material is more easily handled than material of higher frame rates. 24p material requires care when it is processed using equipment designed for standard video frame rates.

There are two common workflows for processing 24p material using video equipment, one using PAL frame rates, and the other using NTSC frame rates. Of these two, the PAL route is the simpler, but each has its own complications.

== 24p vs. PAL video ==
=== Converting 24p to PAL ===

24p material can be converted to the PAL format with the same methods used to convert film to PAL. The most popular method is to speed up the material by 1/24 (≈4.1%). Each 24p frame will take the place of two 50i fields. This method incurs no motion artifacts other than the slightly increased speed, which is typically not noticeable. As for audio, the ≈4.1% increase in speed raises the pitch by 0.707 of a semitone, which again typically is not noticed. Sometimes the audio is pitch shifted to restore the original pitch.

If 24p footage cannot be sped up (for example if it were coming through a live NTSC or HD feed), it instead can be converted in a pattern where most frames were held on screen for two fields, but every half second a frame would be held for three fields. Thus the viewer would see motion stutter twice per second. This was the common result when programs were shot on film or had film portions, edited on NTSC, and then shown in PAL countries (mostly music videos). NTSC to PAL conversion also tends to blur each film frame into the next, and so is seen as a sub-optimal way to view film footage.

30p can be preferable over 24p since performing a standards conversion to 25i PAL has fewer technical complexities – any NTSC–PAL converter will do. The larger differences between the 30p and 25i framerates will cause less noticeable motion artifacts upon conversion.

=== Non-linear editing and 24/25 telecine ===

The process of transferring 24 frame/s video at 25 frame/s rates is also the most common method for ingesting 24p film rushes into a non-linear editor. The resulting 25 frame/s video can then be transferred into a non-linear editing system at 25 frame/s, maintaining the 1:1 frame correspondence between film frames and video frames. Once in the non-linear editing system, the editing system, knowing that the material actually originated 24 frame/s rather than at 25 frame/s, will replay it at the correct speed.

The original film Keykode and 24 frame/s audio timecode can be then be reconciled with the 25 frame/s telecine timecode by the generation of a telecine log file containing this information. Again, once the non-linear editor has this information, editing can be performed entirely in terms of 24 frame/s timecode, and the Keykode information preserved for either film cutting or digital intermediate post-production of scanned film images.

Because sound is recorded separately from moving pictures in 24p projects, there are no problems regarding synchronization or audio pitch: the audio material is simply ingested separately from the moving picture material at its natural rate, and synchronized within the non-linear editor.

== 24p vs. NTSC video ==
=== Conversion of 24p to NTSC-based frame/field rates ===
Working with 24p material via video equipment working at NTSC frame rates has many of the same attributes as the 24 frame/s workflow, but is more complicated by the NTSC-rate practice of using telecine pull-down rather than the PAL practice of transferring 24 frame/s material at 25 frame/s.

At 525 lines analog NTSC video rates (30000/1001 frames per second) a full &quot;interlaced&quot; frame, unlike a progressive frame, is nearly 1/30th of a second and is composed of two separate &quot;fields,&quot; each field nearly 1/60 second. The first field (the odd field) contains visible scan lines 21-263 and the second field (the even field) contains visible scan lines 283–525 (though lines 263 and 283 are half-lines). What is seen onscreen is two of these fields, &quot;interlaced&quot; together, to produce a single full frame. This comes from the proper longhand designation being vertical resolution, followed by the interlaced/progressive notation, and then the frame rate. So typical DV video is correctly listed as 480i/30. The long hand for 24p is 480p/24. Often the resolution is dropped and the i/p designation moved after the frame rate for shorthand.

24p cameras do not, as NTSC video cameras do, shoot 30 interlaced frames per second (60 fields); they shoot 24 full progressive frames per second.

24p material can be recorded directly into formats that support the framerate. Some of high definition formats support the 24p framerate in addition to 60i and 50i (PAL). Previously, few formats supported 24p and the industry used workarounds to work with 24p footage with 60i equipment.

To record 24p material onto a 60i format (i.e. any NTSC-based format), pulldown is typically added to &#x27;pad&#x27; the 24 frames into 60 fields. This is done by taking every frame and splitting it into two fields. Then, every second frame has one of its fields duplicated, resulting in three fields. The fields are then played back in that pattern – 2-3-2-3-2-3-2-3-2-3-2-3-2-3 ... and so on. The resulting video becomes a 60i stream and can be displayed on NTSC monitors. However, the aesthetic of 24p motion is retained and the footage does not have the motion of typical 60i video.

This 3:2 pulldown is the same process that is used when transferring film into video.

Any editing application which supports NTSC video can be used to edit footage employing the 3:2 pulldown scheme. It can be captured as a standard 60i file and edited like footage from any other camera, while still retaining its 24p aesthetic. There can be issues when editing the footage as 60i, however, including choppiness in short transitions or fades, and also a mismatch in the motion characteristics of the footage and any graphics which may be added to it, such as text or logos. So, while 24p footage can be edited as 60i, it is usually better to edit the footage on a 24p timeline with the pulldown removed.

Most current -level editing applications which edit native 24p can remove the 3:2 pulldown for editing in native 24p, although some cannot. However, this is not ideal; the removal of the 3:2 pulldown involves reconstruction of every fourth frame from two different field groups, which can cause a generational loss and some banding problems if the application doesn&#x27;t interpret the footage properly. Therefore, using the 3:2 pulldown scheme is not ideal when planning to edit on a 24p timeline.

Note: &quot;3:2 pulldown&quot; has a cadence of 2-3-2-3-2-3..., but in the industry is called &quot;3:2 pulldown&quot;, even though the cadence is 2–3. Some people use the term &quot;2:3 pulldown&quot;, which corresponds to the cadence, but is not normally used in the industry for the technique.

=== Advanced pulldown ===
Another pulldown pattern is the &quot;advanced pulldown&quot; (&quot;24pA&quot;) pattern, first implemented in the Panasonic AG-DVX100 camcorder. Instead of padding the frames into a repeating 3:2 pattern, the frames are padded into a 2:3:3:2 pattern. This pattern is specific to the NTSC DV format, and would serve no purpose in native 24p formats.

It converts the first frame into two fields, the second into three fields, the third into three fields, and the fourth into two fields. It then repeats this pattern for every group of four frames that follows. This pulldown pattern is used to avoid segmenting a 24p frame into two different 60i fields that exist in two different 60i frames. When a 24p frame is split up and recorded into separate 60i fields, interlacing artifacts can exist in the 60i &quot;frames&quot; (i.e. two fields). These artifacts decrease the compression efficiency of DV and can result in cycles of efficient compression followed by less-efficient compression. The advanced pulldown scheme avoids this as every 24p frame can be found intact within the resulting sequence of 60i frames, yet the compression efficiency remains the same as with 3:2 pulldown.

When editing 24pA footage, conversion from 60i back to the original 24p is very efficient. It only requires blending the fields made from the frames back into full frames. Then, only every fifth frame will be made up of fields from two different frames, and that frame can be discarded, leaving only the other four full frames. In order for this to work properly, the DVX100 camera records video in chunks of five video frames. This ensures that each clip has regular and predictable cadence.

Because the 2:3:3:2 scheme was devised for efficient pulldown removal for editing, and because 24p editing applications more universally support its removal, it should always be used when planning to edit in native 24p.

Editing systems need specific support for the 24pA format to be able to detect and remove the pulldown properly so that the 24p frames can be edited in a 24p timeline. Many but not all prosumer and professional-level non-linear editing systems are able to recognize and remove this advanced pulldown scheme. However, among the editing applications able to remove pulldown and edit in native 24p, it is more common for them to have support for 24pA 2:3:3:2 pulldown than for standard 24p 3:2 pulldown removal.

Still other editing applications have the option for editing on a 24p timeline, and will accept footage where the pulldown has already been removed in another application.

Remember that although computer editing systems may refer to &quot;24p&quot;, usually the frame rate is 23.976 frame/s. To add to confusion, the popular editing program Final Cut Pro refers to 23.976 as &quot;23.98&quot; in menus and dialogs, even though it correctly works with the footage at the 23.976 frame rate. 23.976 is also not precise though, as the real frame rate is 24000/1001, so 23.98 is also a correct approximation.

Also because the 2:3:3:2 pulldown scheme was devised in order to make pulldown removal for editing in native 24p more efficient, the pulldown arrangement is not ideal for watching footage. There can be exaggerated stutters in motion, because the frames which are split into three fields are not only onscreen for 50% longer than the other frames, they are back-to-back. As such, 2:3:3:2 pulldown should be used only when a native 24p edit is planned, and not for final viewing. This includes when shooting the footage initially, and also when printing back to tape from an NLE.

=== 60i to 24p conversions ===

Another method of achieving the 24p aesthetic is to capture 60i footage and convert it into 24p. Various techniques can be used to perform this conversion. A simple scheme would blend the fields together. This can result in motion artifacts where comb-like jagged artifacts appear in areas of high motion. Deinterlacing can remove these artifacts, but certain methods will cause up to half the footage&#x27;s vertical resolution to be lost. Adaptive deinterlacing schemes only deinterlace areas of high motion, hence preserving resolution in stationary areas. More advanced techniques can be used to mitigate problems such as aliasing from the temporal displacement between the 60i fields.

=== The Optical Flow Method ===

This is currently the highest quality method of converting 60i footage to 24p. It involves using optical flow to extrapolate 24 frames of information from 60 frames while compensating for the time displacement between the two. For example, in one second of 60i footage, each image is captured at 1/60 second, which does not perfectly align with images that would have been captured 24 times per second. Simply &quot;cherry picking&quot; 24 images out of 60 does not present 24 frames with perfect temporal consistency, since more or less time may have elapsed between frames. The result is a slightly jittery picture, which appears to jitter in a cyclic fashion. Optical flow algorithms will analyze the footage and make corrections to the picture in order to better &quot;fit&quot; each frame into the new 24 frame sequence. The resulting footage is much smoother because it simulates equal exposure time between frames.

For best results, footage should be deinterlaced and frame-doubled to 60p. This preserves all of the footage&#x27;s temporal information, which is key in determining what the &quot;missing&quot; points in time should look like when converting to 24 frame/s.

The last step is to compensate for the lack of motion blur in the 60i footage. Since the images were captured at 1/60 second, there is less motion blur between images than there would have been if shot at 24 frame/s with a 180° shutter (i.e. 1/48 second exposure time). Optical flow is used to introduce motion blur between frames, mimicking the motion blur present when shooting the standard 180° shutter angle. This method of creating motion blur is far more realistic than simple frame blending, which is simple to implement and usually a standard feature in most non-linear editing programs.

The optical flow method also works with 30p footage and is currently the best option for 30p to 24p conversion.

=== 60i to 24p slow-motion conversions ===
==== Using Adobe After Effects ====
This method requires the use of Adobe After Effects and applies to any interlaced material. It uses all of the temporal information in 50i or 60i footage to create the equivalent of a slow motion sequence shot at 50 or 60 frames per second, respectively. It also does not require multiple render passes to achieve the effect, avoiding generation loss from multiple compression cycles.

==== Using VirtualDub + AviSynth ====
VirtualDub, along with AviSynth, can be used to perform a 60i to 24p conversion in a similar way to After Effects. AviSynth performs the deinterlacing, then frameserves the 60p half-resolution result to VirtualDub for further processing (specifically, adjusting field height using the &quot;field bob&quot; filter, resizing back to full resolution and then outputting at 24 frame/s). The reason AviSynth must be used is because VirtualDub cannot split the fields into a 60p sequence on its own, and this technique requires 60p input.

=== Displaying 24p material ===

With NTSC equipment, it is impossible to display a 24p signal directly as the monitors only support the 60i framerate. Hence, pulldown must be added to the 24p material to be displayed. Most editing systems will either add 3:2 pulldown or 2:2:2:4 pulldown. In the 2:2:2:4 pulldown scheme, used as a choice primarily by Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro v7 and earlier, every fourth frame is repeated. This scheme is easier for slower hardware to implement as it requires less processing, but it introduces significant judder due to frame duplication.

In HD production, the HD-SDI interface supports the 24p framerate in addition to the 60i and 50i framerates. Many HD monitors are able to receive a 24p signal (not a 60i signal with pulldown added) and can display the 24p material directly.

For end-user viewing of HD material, many digital formats are offering 24p support. Computer formats such as Windows Media, QuickTime, and RealVideo can play 24p video directly on a computer monitor. Many early NTSC plasma and LCD monitors operated at 60 Hz and only supported 1080i (60i) or 720p (60p) content sources, requiring input signals 24p to be converted by the external source. Later 60 Hz monitors could accept 1080p24 content but employed a 3:2 pulldown to display 24p content, creating judder. Many monitors now support signal processing at 120 Hz or higher, allowing 24p content to be displayed without judder by showing each frame for a fixed number of refresh cycles. For example, a 120 Hz display can show each 24p frame for exactly 5 display frames. This capability is independent of the motion interpolation features that are often associated with 120 Hz+ televisions.

=== 24p compared to 30p ===

As Charles Poynton explains, the 24 frame/s rate is not just a cinema standard, it is also &quot;uniquely suited to conversion to both 50 Hz systems (through 2:2 pulldown, 4% fast) and 59.94 Hz systems (through 2:3 pulldown, 0.1% slow). Choosing a rate other than 24 frame/s would compromise this widely accepted method of conversion, and make it difficult for film producers to access international markets&quot;.

== Native 24p ==
=== 24p on DVD ===

MPEG-2 stream on DVDs is capable of storing the 24000 ÷ 1001 frames losslessly packing them into fields in 30 ÷ 1001 interlaced stream using soft telecine flags. Most of movies are thus laid to disc as a 24000 ÷ 1001 soft telecined stream. With a progressive-scan DVD player and a progressive display, such as an HDTV, the inverse telecine is applied and progressive frames are restored. There is no conversion to an interlaced format, which eliminates the appearance of any interlace or deinterlacing artifacts. When displayed on a back then standard NTSC TV (which only displays 60i) the DVD player will read soft telecine flags and repeat frames, applying interlace to the signal.

In traditional back then television broadcast and VHS, the video stream has 3:2 pulldown already added. This material could not have been displayed progressively without the resolution loss of deinterlacing, unless the deinterlacer has accurate cadence detection and the rusulting framerate was two times more than frame rate of DVD. 

Soft telecine flags can be applied to only some portions of a stream. What that means is that part of the movie is progressive and should be inverse telecined and part of the movie is interlaced and should be deinterlaced or presented on interlaced display. That makes the movie variable frame rate (VFR). Moreover, even more complicated cadences can be present on DVDs and those should be also correctly handled.

=== 24p video production ===

Increasingly, 24p is used to acquire video. The most prolific use of this has been with HDTV and digital cinema such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy.

In 2002, Panasonic released the DV camera AG-DVX100 (followed by the updated models AG-DVX100A in 2004 and AG-DVX100B in 2005). This camera was the first DV camera that could switch between different frame rates, including 60i, 30p, and 24p with a choice between the 2:3:3:2 or 3:2 pulldown schemes. The 24p feature on the camera produces film-like video that is preferred by many narrative filmmakers. Canon soon followed suit with the Canon XL-2, offering the same frame rates and pulldown choices as the DVX100.

Following the success of the DVX100, in December, 2005, Panasonic released the Panasonic AG-HVX200, which offers 24p HD at the sub-$10,000 level. Basically an HD version of the DVX100 series, it heavily targets independent filmmakers, as HD has a much higher resolution than DV and will generally look superior on a film blow-up. It is also noteworthy that the camera records HD footage, complete with clip information, to static P2 memory cards instead of tape. This signified a radical change in the video editing workflow.

For recording 24p to tape in formats which typically do not support 24p, such as DV, options include PsF (Progressive segmented Frame), 2:3 Pulldown and advanced pulldown.

Some music videos and television series today are shot with 24p video.

=== 23.976p ===
Some 24p productions, especially those made only for NTSC TV and video distribution (e.g., in Canada or the USA), actually have a frame rate of 24000 ÷ 1001, or 23. frames per second. Many use the term &quot;24p&quot; as a shorthand for this frame rate, since &quot;23.976&quot; does not roll off the tongue as easily. This is because the &quot;30 frame/s&quot; frame rate of NTSC is actually 30/100.1%, also referred to as 29.97 frame/s – this frame rate is matched when video at 23.976 frame/s has a 3:2 pulldown applied. Similarly, 60i is shorthand for 60/100.1% fields per second. Some NLE programs may refer to 23.976 as 23.98, causing a small amount of confusion.

Note that with 23.976 fps time code, the &quot;second&quot; counter is still increased after 24 frames, even though 24 frames add up to slightly more than a real second. When working with other time sources, confusion can arise since a &quot;second&quot; in 23.976 fps time code notation is slightly longer than a real second, it is 1.001 (24 × 1 / (24000 / 1001)) seconds long. In other words, when a time code was reached of 00:16:40:00, this does not mean the video has played for 16 real minutes and 40 real seconds (1000 seconds), but that it has actually played for exactly 16 minutes and 41 seconds (1001 seconds).

Nevertheless, even in NTSC regions, film productions are often shot at exactly 24 frame/s (this is called integer frame rate), especially for DCI. This can be a source of confusion and technical difficulties. 4K Blu-rays for Europe also often use 24.000 frame rate. 

Material is treated as normal video, since the slightly differing frame rates can be problematic for video and audio sync. However, this is not a problem if the video material is merely treated as a carrier for material which is known by the editing system to be &quot;true&quot; 24 frame/s, and audio is recorded separately from moving images, as is normal film practice.

An added technical problem is that the popular Matroska (.mkv) video container format allows novice users to declare that 23.976 video is 24.000, and this can result in codec conversion errors with concomitant video stuttering (due to frame &quot;dropping&quot; and &quot;cloning&quot;) and loss of audio sync. On the other hand, some Netflix originals are encoded in 24.000 (such as &quot;The Witcher&quot;), which is problematic to play for some devices (e.g. via Apple TV, that was fixed 3 years later by Apple, and Xbox Series X).

=== 24p in high definition disc formats ===
Both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc support the 24p frame rate, but technical implementations of this mode are different among the two formats. Blu-ray Disc supports both 24.000p or 23.976p with its native timing, while HD DVD uses 60i timing for 24p (replacing &quot;missing&quot; frames with &quot;repeat field flags&quot;, the same as in DVD-Video).
=== Confusion with 23p, 29p, 59p, 119p in Windows ===
Old menus on Windows 10 used 23p for 24 ÷ 1.001, just like 29 for 30 ÷ 1.001, 59p for 60 ÷ 1.001 and 119p for 120 ÷ 1.001. Integer frame rates were just 24, 30, 60, 120. This was corrected in Windows 10 20H2, where in new display settings menu actual 23.976, 29.970, 59.940 and 119.880 are used.

==Disadvantages==

In general, 24 frames-per-second video has more trouble with fast camera motion than other, higher frame rates, sometimes showing a &quot;strobe&quot; or &quot;choppy&quot; motion, just like 24 frame/s film will if shot as if it is video, without slower camera panning and zooming motion. It is therefore not well-suited for programming requiring spontaneous camera action or &quot;reality&quot; camerawork. Nevertheless, effective &quot;smoothing&quot; high frame rate upscalers were created; the latest generation of those on AI do not introduce artifacts in frames.

==Future==
Digital cinema equipment is now capable of handling much higher frame rates, such as 48p, 60p and 120p frame rates even in 3D, along with the traditional 24p. 3D in Blu-ray is still only 24p max. 48p has twice the motion resolution of 24p, but also requires more bandwidth, data storage, and potentially illumination level. Peter Jackson&#x27;s three part film &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a production that makes use of the 48p frame rate, but 48p was never used on Blu-ray or streaming platforms, only in cinemas. Other movies, however, have been released at higher framerates on Blu-ray (such as Billy Lynn&#x27;s Long Halftime Walk).

Some current, best-of-breed professional video cameras provide 120 frame/s progressive capture, which is 5 times 24p and can be converted to 24p, 30p, 50i, and 60i/p with editing options and precision in motion shots.

<text>Chrono Break is a cancelled third mainline entry in the &quot;Chrono&quot; series of video games by Square. While never officially announced by the company, commentary from &quot;Chrono&quot; series developers Masato Kato, Hironobu Sakaguchi, and Takashi Tokita have confirmed early plans for the game, alongside a number of trademarks filed in the game&#x27;s name. However, the game would ultimately go unproduced, with many members of the internal development team either moving on to &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; or leaving the company in favor of freelance work. The game elicited much commentary from the company and the video game press in the following years, though as of 2021, all trademarks had expired, with no announced plans to work on the game.

==History==

===Registration===
The initial &quot;Chrono Break&quot; trademark for a video game was registered by Square (now Square Enix) in the United States on December 5, 2001. A similar trademark was registered by the company in the European Union a week later.

The registration followed a press report of talks about a new &quot;Chrono&quot; series game. Within this report, Hironobu Sakaguchi stated that the development team of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, especially Masato Kato, was interested in creating a new game in the series, and that script and story ideas were currently being considered, but that the project had not yet been greenlighted. Kato had previously mentioned in the &quot;Ultimania&quot; guide for &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; that he wanted to create a direct sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; to wrap up certain story elements and plot threads, but the pitfalls of a direct sequel prompted them to do &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; instead. The registration, and Sakaguchi&#x27;s comments, led video game journalists to believe that a sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; was in full development. IGN Editor Douglass Perry went as far as to say &quot;...we&#x27;re almost positive that you can expect to see this awaited monster in 2004.&quot; On November 13, 2003, the trademark was dropped in the U.S. It expired on December 14, 2011, in the European Union, and on July 26, 2012, in Japan. A similar trademark was registered in 2001 by Square Enix in Japan as .

===Official response===
Inquiry over a new title was subsequently large enough to warrant an entry in Square Enix&#x27;s FAQ page, in which the company noted that no new game was in development, though this did not mean the series was dead. In 2006, the entry was revised to include sequel inquiries for any series. After the release of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, a number of key staff from the title left Square to form a new development studio, Monolith Soft, which was initially owned by Namco and is currently a first-party developer working under Nintendo. Other staff who had worked on the title remained at Square and proceeded to work on &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, an MMORPG conceived by Hironobu Sakaguchi – one of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;″s creators. During an interview at E3 2003, this development team stated that they would love to develop a new &quot;Chrono&quot; game, but their commitment to &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; would keep them busy for a long time. Richard Honeywood, localization director for Square Enix, explained,

Takashi Tokita, who directed &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, mentioned a &quot;Chrono Trigger 2&quot; in a 2003 interview which has not been translated to English. &quot;Trigger&quot; developer Yuji Horii expressed no interest in returning to the &quot;Chrono&quot; franchise in 2005. In February 2007, Square Enix producer Hiromichi Tanaka took part in several interviews while promoting games in Europe. Tanaka reiterated that no new game was in development, but that a return was certainly not out of the question.

In January 2008, composer Yasunori Mitsuda remarked that &quot;there are a lot of politics involved&quot; in creating a new game, and stressed that Masato Kato should participate in development should a new entry in the series materialize. He did say that he was open to working with the company on the series again &quot;if they had a good concept for the game&quot;, and he speculated that Kato &quot;probably would&quot; as well.

In August 2014, at a PAX Prime panel, Sakaguchi stated that he had intended on continuing the &quot;Chrono&quot; series into another game, but that problems with Square Enix management prevented it from coming to fruition.

In December 2015, Kato confirmed that Square Enix had indeed discussed a project called &quot;Chrono Break&quot;, but that he was personally not involved with it.

In December 2017, Tokita stated that some smaller elements of &quot;Chrono Break&quot; eventually made it into his &quot;Final Fantasy Dimensions II&quot; game. He explained: &quot;There was actually a time when I planned a new title called &quot;Chrono Break&quot;. Though it was canceled before accomplishing anything, the overall idea for the title was carried over to my latest game, &quot;Final Fantasy Dimensions II&quot;. Aemo&#x27;s character setting and the balance between the three characters at the beginning ... these were based on the original concept [for &quot;Chrono Break&quot;] but were reworked for this title.&quot; Tokita confirmed the following year that he had begun preproduction on the game in 2000, and ultimately recycled his story ideas for &quot;Final Fantasy Dimensions II&quot;.

==Aftermath==
The February 2008 issue of &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked the &quot;Chrono&quot; series eighth among the &quot;Top Ten Sequels in Demand&quot;, naming the games &quot;steadfast legacies in the Square Enix catalogue&quot; and asking &quot;what&#x27;s the damn holdup?!&quot;. In &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s June 2008 &quot;Retro Issue&quot;, writer Jeremy Parish cited &quot;Chrono&quot; as the franchise video game fans would be most thrilled to see a sequel to. In the first May &quot;Famitsu&quot; of 2009, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; placed 14th out of 50 in a vote of most-wanted sequels by the magazine&#x27;s readers. At E3 2009, SE Senior Vice President Shinji Hashimoto remarked &quot;If people want a sequel, they should buy more!&quot; In 2012, a trademark for &quot;Chrono Bind&quot; by Square Enix lead Siliconera to speculate that the game had switched titles from &quot;Chrono Break&quot; to &quot;Chrono Bind&quot;; however, it was later revealed to merely be the name of a DLC card game in &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot;. In the same year, Kotaku expressed disappointment that Square Enix had not acted on the &quot;Chrono Break&quot; name, citing strong sales of the DS port of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; as a reason as to why the company should release a third game in the series. Siliconera described the game as &quot;a beacon of hope&quot; for the game&#x27;s fanbase, as proof that the company had in the past plans to continue the series. Kato revealed in 2015 that he had no involvement with whatever project Square had begun to develop under the &quot;Chrono Break&quot; trademark, and that his idea for a final game would have involved Kid and other &quot;all-star&quot; characters rescuing Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Though acknowledging in this interview that his idea of an ending to the trilogy would &quot;never come out&quot;, Kato then discussed his involvement in writing &quot;Another Eden&quot;, which notably features a frog knight character and time travel.

<doc id="577270" wikidata="Q437117" url="?curid=577270" title="Toshiko Akiyoshi">
<text>is an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader.

Akiyoshi received fourteen Grammy Award nominations and was the first woman to win Best Arranger and Composer awards in &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Readers&#x27; Poll. In 1984, she was the subject of the documentary &quot;Jazz Is My Native Language&quot;. In 1996, she published her autobiography, &quot;Life with Jazz&quot;, and in 2007 she was named an NEA Jazz Master by the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts.

==Biography==
Akiyoshi was born in Liaoyang, Manchuria, to a Japanese family, the youngest of four sisters. In 1945, after World War II, Akiyoshi&#x27;s family lost their home and returned to Japan, settling in Beppu. A local record collector introduced her to jazz by playing a record of Teddy Wilson playing &quot;Sweet Lorraine.&quot; She immediately loved the sound and began to study jazz. In 1953, during a tour of Japan, pianist Oscar Peterson discovered her playing in a club on the Ginza. Peterson was impressed and convinced record producer Norman Granz to record her. In 1953, under Granz&#x27;s direction, she recorded her first album with Peterson&#x27;s rhythm section: Herb Ellis on guitar, Ray Brown on double bass, and J. C. Heard on drums. The album was released with the title &quot;Toshiko&#x27;s Piano&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Amazing Toshiko Akiyoshi&quot; in Japan.

Akiyoshi studied jazz at the Berklee School of Music in Boston. In 1955, she wrote a letter to Lawrence Berk, asking him to give her a chance to study at his school. After a year of wrangling with the State Department and Japanese officials, Berk was given permission for Akiyoshi to enroll. He offered her a full scholarship, and he mailed her a plane ticket to Boston. In January 1956, she became the first Japanese student at Berklee. Soon after, she appeared as a contestant on the 18 March 1956 broadcast of the CBS television panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; In 1998, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee, by then known as the Berklee College of Music.

Akiyoshi did experience some difficulties as a result of her Japanese heritage after coming to America. Some of her audience saw her as an oddity more than a talented musician, a Japanese girl playing jazz in America. According to Akiyoshi, some of her success was attributed to her being an oddity, saying in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, “In those days, a Japanese woman playing like Bud Powell was something very new. So all the press, the attention, wasn’t because I was authentic...It was because I was &quot;strange&quot;”. Despite being born in Manchuria, Akiyoshi considers herself Japanese and, , had not obtained American citizenship.

Akiyoshi married saxophonist Charlie Mariano in 1959. The couple had a daughter, Michiru. She and Mariano divorced in 1967 after forming several bands together. During the same year, she met saxophonist Lew Tabackin, whom she married in 1969. Akiyoshi, Tabackin, and Michiru moved to Los Angeles in 1972. In March 1973, Akiyoshi and Tabackin formed a 16-piece big band composed of studio musicians. Akiyoshi composed and arranged music for the band, and Tabackin served as the band&#x27;s featured soloist on tenor saxophone and flute. The band recorded its first album, &quot;Kogun&quot;, in 1974. The title, which translates to &quot;one-man army&quot;, was inspired by the tale of a Japanese soldier lost for 30 years in the jungle who believed that World War II was still being fought and thus remained loyal to the Emperor. &quot;Kogun&quot; was commercially successful in Japan, and the band began to receive critical acclaim.

The couple moved to New York City in 1982 and assembled the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra featuring Lew Tabackin. Akiyoshi toured with smaller bands to raise money for her big band. Years later, BMG continued to release her big band&#x27;s recordings in Japan but remained skeptical about releasing the music in the United States Although Akiyoshi was able to release several albums in the U.S. featuring her piano in solo and small combo settings, many of her later big band albums were released only in Japan.

On Monday, 29 December 2003, her band played its final concert at Birdland in New York City, where it had enjoyed a regular Monday night gig for more than seven years. Akiyoshi explained that she disbanded the ensemble because she was frustrated by her inability to obtain American recording contracts for the big band. She also said that she wanted to concentrate on her piano playing from which she had been distracted by years of composing and arranging. She has said that although she has rarely recorded as a solo pianist, that is her preferred format. On 24 March 2004, Warner Japan released the final recording of Akiyoshi&#x27;s big band. Titled &quot;Last Live in Blue Note Tokyo&quot;, the album was recorded 28–29 November 2003.

==Music==

Akiyoshi&#x27;s Japanese heritage is distinctly present in her music and sets her compositions apart from other jazz musicians. When Duke Ellington died in 1974, Nat Hentoff wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that Ellington&#x27;s music reflected his African heritage. Akiyoshi was inspired to investigate her Japanese musical heritage. She composed using Japanese themes, harmonies, and instruments (kotsuzumi, kakko, utai, tsugaru shamisen). But her music remained planted firmly in jazz, reflecting influences from Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, and Bud Powell.

One reviewer of the live album &quot;Road Time&quot; said the music on Akiyoshi&#x27;s big band albums demonstrated &quot;a level of compositional and orchestral ingenuity that made her one of perhaps two or three composer-arrangers in jazz whose name could seriously be mentioned in the company of Duke Ellington, Eddie Sauter, and Gil Evans.&quot;

In 1999, Akiyoshi was approached by Kyudo Nakagawa, a Buddhist priest, who asked her to write a piece for his hometown of Hiroshima. He sent her some photos of the aftermath of the nuclear bombing. Her initial reaction was horror. She could not see how she could compose anything to address the event. Finally, she found a picture of a young woman emerging from an underground shelter with a faint smile on her face. Akiyoshi said that after seeing this picture, she understood the message: hope. With that message in mind, she composed the three-part suite &quot;Hiroshima: Rising from the Abyss&quot;. The piece was premiered in Hiroshima on 6 August 2001, the 56th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. The Hiroshima suite appeared on the 2002 album &quot;Hiroshima – Rising from the Abyss&quot;.

<text>Radio 1RPH 1125 kHz Canberra (89.5FM Wagga, 99.5FM Junee) is a volunteer-staffed AM band radio broadcast station in the Australian Capital Territory serving all of the ACT and surrounding areas of NSW including Queanbeyan, Yass and Michelago, with FM repeaters at Wagga and Junee, and a streaming media on its web site.

Radio 1RPH is a member of the Radio Print Handicapped Network. Its catch-phrases are, Your information station and Turning print into sound, and it is intended to serve all those who are, for any reason, handicapped from reading printed material.

Newspapers, magazines, books, and other printed material are read to air. 1RPH used to have a frequency just outside the AM band on 1620 kHz, and so suffered little interference, and was heard as far away as the United States.

==Effect of NDIS==
In February 2016, the station management announced that it had been advised that $38,000 would not be available from the ACT Government&#x27;s Disability ACT as of July 2016, when these funds would become part of the general National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) funds administered by the Commonwealth Government. This amount represented roughly a quarter of the station&#x27;s operating budget. Disability Minister Chris Bourke declined to promise funding from ACT resources, but said he would make enquiries of the Federal Minister for Disability. Leading the effort to publicise this funding shortfall were: President, Lorraine Litster; Vice President, and People With Disabilities ACT president, Robert Altamore; and volunteer broadcaster and ACT Legislative Assembly member, Vicki Dunne MLA. Litster pointed out that, of the $22 billion/year scheme, only $132 million has been set aside for services including the Radio Print Handicapped Network. The National Disability Insurance Authority (NDIA) has said it will be considering the matter.

<text>The African hawk-eagle (Aquila spilogaster) is a large bird of prey. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family &quot;Accipitridae&quot;. This species&#x27; feathered legs mark it as a member of the Aquilinae subfamily. The African hawk-eagle breeds in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a bird of assorted woodland, including both savanna and hilly areas but the tend to occur in woodland that is typically dry. The species tends to be rare in areas where their preferred habitat type is absent. This species builds a stick nest of around across in a large tree. The clutch is generally one or two eggs. The African hawk-eagle is powerfully built and hunts small to medium-sized mammals and birds predominantly, occasionally taking reptiles and other prey as well. The call is a shrill &quot;kluu-kluu-kluu&quot;. The African hawk-eagle is considered a fairly stable species and a species of Least Concern per the IUCN.

==Taxonomy==
The African eagle is a member of the Aquilinae or booted eagles. This is a rather monophyletic subfamily of Approximately 38 species are classified in the subfamily, all bearing the signature well-feathered tarsi. The Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;) was once lumped within the same species as the African hawk-eagle. However, there are several morphological differences between the two species, in addition to discrepancies in life history and their considerably allopatric distribution. Now, the two species are almost universally considered distinct species. Despite the differences between the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle and the African hawk-eagle the two species are visibly similar and are still considered sister species. Recent DNA research has resulted in the two species being moved, in 2014, to the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; from &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;, along with a third possibly related species, the Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;Aquila africana&quot;). More specifically and surprisingly, Bonelli&#x27;s, African hawk- and Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagles were found to be genetically closely related to the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) species complex, which also includes Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila verreauxii&quot;), Gurney&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila gurneyi&quot;) and wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;). These species are all rather larger and morphologically distinct (in adaptation to their open country habits) from the Bonelli&#x27;s and African hawk-eagles and tend to have much more uniform and darker ventral plumages. Furthermore the four other traditional members of the &quot;Aquila&quot; genus have been revealed to be a separate species complex despite showing superficial similarity to the golden eagle group, i.e. being relatively large and long winged with usually rather uniform and dark (typically brownish) colours.

==Description==

The African hawk-eagle has a somewhat small head but one that protrudes quite well due its quite long neck and relatively prominent beak. Furthermore, the species possesses a longish tail, with long and somewhat slender feathered legs and has large, robust feet. Although African hawk-eagles occasionally take to perching in the open, they usually are somewhat obscured for much of the day within the cover of foliage and often perch relatively low down in tall trees. The wing tips tend to fall a bit short of the tail tip. The adult African hawk-eagle evidences a fairly pied look with slate black-grey coloration above and whitish coloration below. At a distance, they may appear purely black-and-white but at close range they show sparse but extensive white flecks on the mantle and wing coverts. Occasionally, a greyer patch may be apparent on the folded secondaries of perched or sitting birds. The tail of an adult is grey with thin dark bars, a broad subterminal band and a white tail tip. The adult hawk-eagle&#x27;s underside is white with bold but small and sparse drop-like blackish streaks. As was noted in a 2010 study, in a usual instance of plumage sexual dimorphism for an Aquilinae eagle, the underside tends to more sparsely marked on adult males and more densely marked on adult females to such a degree that an experienced observer may be able to sex individual African hawk-eagles despite the two sexes being similar in size. The adult African hawk-eagles has whitish coloring on the thighs and the crissum. The juvenile of the species is highly distinct from older hawk-eagles. Juveniles are moderately dark brown above with some pale edging, a slightly black-streaked head and a more clearly barred tail than adult hawk-eagles. The underside has a tawny-rufous base colour. When juvenile African hawk-eagles present black shaft streaks below they are usually only obvious on the flanks and they can border on being absent. Once developing as an immature at two to four years old, the upperside becomes progressively darker, the underside paler and more streaked and a subterminal tail band forms. At four years of age, as in related species, the African hawk-eagle becomes fully mature. The eyes of adult hawk-eagles are rich yellow while those of juveniles are hazel-brown while the cere and feet at all ages range from dull to somewhat brighter yellow.

In flight, the African hawk-eagle appears as a mid-sized raptor with a rather small but well-protruding head, a longish tail and wings that are neither particularly long nor broad. The species tends to flight with powerful and shallow beats. When gliding or soaring, their wings tend to be well-spread and, when engaging a glide, their carpal points tend to be only slightly forward pressed. Adult African hawk-eagle possess on the upperside of their wings a significant pale whitish-grey window on the base of their primaries, extending into dark grey panels across the black-tipped secondaries. The grey tail usually only shows obscure bars from a distance besides the broad subterminal band. From below, the black trailing edges with contrasting greyish white flight feathers as well as the more apparent subterminal band are in both cases distinctly abutted by paler grey feathering. The greater coverts show various solid black diagonal markings that coalesce and create a signature appearance from below in a flying adult African hawk-eagle. In flying juveniles, if seen from above, the contrasting creamy window, as in the adults, and barred tail stand out as the most distinct features of the species. Below, the juvenile African hawk-eagles show rufous wing linings that match the forebody and rather varying dusky edges, which often form carpal arcs and sometimes continuing as wing diagonals. The wings are otherwise rather nondescript in juvenile African hawk-eagles with greyish buff secondaries and tail thinly barred and white-based primaries.

===Size===

The African hawk-eagle is a small-to-mid-sized eagle and a fairly large raptor. Despite its relatively modest size, this species can appear surprisingly large when perched or standing on the ground due in no small part to its long neck, long legs and rather upright posture. The sexes are rather similar in size for a bird of prey, but the females, in the expected sexual dimorphism, averages about 5% about larger and up to 20% heavier. On the other hand, there is reportedly little overall discrepancy in their foot size or particularly in talon size. In total length, African hawk-eagles may vary in length from , with some of the largest females measuring to as much as . Mean length of a male may be around while the mean length of a female may be around . Wingspan among this species may vary from . Body mass in males can vary from while the body mass of females can vary from . In one sample, 14 males were found to have averaged while a sample of 10 males averaged . In same datasets, 7 females averaged and 10 females averaged . A sample of 36 unsexed African hawk-eagles in southern Africa averaged in wingspan while an accompanying sample of 21 unsexed specimens averaged in body mass. Among standard measurements, the wing chord of males measures from while that of females is from . African hawk-eagles measure in tail length from and, in a limited sample, in tarsus length from . In Kenya, mean wing chord length of unsexed hawk-eagles was , mean tail length was , mean culmen length was and the hallux claw, the enlarged rear toe talon that is used as the primary killing apparatus on accipitrid raptors, measured a mean of , measuring from in different specimens. The talon size is extremely large for this raptor&#x27;s size, being similar to that of some eagles that are around twice as heavy such as eastern imperial eagles (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;).

===Identification===

The African hawk-eagle is largely allopatric from the most similar extant species of eagle, its sister species, the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle. However, they may need to be distinguished in the Red Sea area, where minimal range overlap occurs. The Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is larger and relatively broader-headed, shorter-necked, with proportionately longer wings and a shorter tail. The adult Bonelli&#x27;s is much lighter and browner dorsally with usually a white patch on the mantle but no paler wing panels above. The Bonelli&#x27;s eagle tends to be less contrastingly marked below, being rather creamy and lacking strong markings. The juvenile Bonelli&#x27;s is a bit more similar to the juvenile African hawk-eagle but can be told apart by proportions and by being paler backed and again lacks the clear &quot;windows&quot; of the juvenile hawk-eagle. There are a few other largely black dorsally and white ventrally largish raptors in sub-Saharan Africa but the African hawk-eagle is the largest and comes the closest to being typically aquiline in bearing and morphology. One species sometimes considered rather similar is the adult Ayres&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus ayresii&quot;) but that hawk-eagle is smaller, more compact as well as being rounder headed. The Ayres&#x27;s may show a nuchal crest and also lacks the windows seen on the wing upperside and is more evenly blotched or streaked all over the underbody, wing linings and legs. Additionally, the Ayres&#x27;s hawk-eagle is less heavily darkly marked on the wings, being more spotted and splotched with black, lacking black trailing wing edges as well as the subterminal tail band of the African. Juvenile Ayres&#x27;s can be similar in flight below to the juvenile African hawk-eagle but is usually paler rufous with darker quills and is generally much paler above with whitish scaling and rufous crown and mantle. Moreover, in all plumages, the Ayres&#x27;s show white &quot;landing lights&quot;, reminiscent of a booted eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus pennatus&quot;). Other raptors of a pied pattern vaguely reminiscent of the African hawk-eagle in Africa, such as the black sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter melanoleucus&quot;), the augur buzzard (&quot;Buteo augur&quot;) and the Cassin&#x27;s hawk eagle (&quot;Aquila africana&quot;), are fairly obviously distinct in appearance and proportions as well as habitat. Of these three, the adult Cassin&#x27;s is by far the most similar in structure and appearance to the African hawk-eagle but the two are mostly allopatric in distribution, with the Cassin&#x27;s typically dwells in mature forests unlike the sparser, drier wooded-savanna habitats of the African hawk-eagle. Compared to the Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagle, the African species is larger, shorted tailed and much longer winged, with a much more heavily marked underbody, denser black about the mid-wings and barely barred quills. At a distance, the African hawk-eagle&#x27;s flight profile can recall that of the European honey-buzzard (&quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;) but the head is even smaller in that species. Furthermore, the wing actions and patterning of this smaller Palearctic migrant is highly different, therefore confusion with the honey-buzzard is quite unlikely. Even more unlikely to be confused with the African hawk-eagles even at a distance is the far larger and bulkier crowned eagle (&quot;Stephanoaetus coronatus&quot;), which is highly distinct in colour and has relatively shorter but much broader wings. One other species that may be need to be distinguished in distant flight, this time from the juvenile African hawk-eagle, is the juvenile booted eagle. That species is smaller but proportionately much longer winged and shorter tailed than the juvenile African hawk-eagle. Furthermore, the booted species is barred on the tail and has completely different underwing pattern.

===Vocalizations===
The African hawk-eagle is generally silent outside breeding season. Its main call is melodious fluting &quot;klooee&quot;. The call is perhaps most often recorded in contact between pair members. The call is sometimes considered not unlike that of the often sympatric Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus wahlbergi&quot;) but that of the African hawk-eagle tends to be less drawn out and more mellow in tone. The main call may be repeated or develop into &quot;klu-klu-klu-kleeee&quot; or &quot;kluu-kluu-kluu&quot; with variations. This extended call may be given both during courtship and in moments of aggression, such as when driving away other raptors near their nest. Often, African hawk-eagles call on near nest including repeated &quot;kweeooo&quot; or &quot;ko-ko-kweroo&quot;, which seemed to be repeated during nest construction and repair. A farther variation, a &quot;kwaak&quot;, may be made by both of a pair when they are excited near the nest. A squealing &quot;skweeyra&quot; call by the female is a probable food solicitation call when she sees the male. In additional, various squawks, clucks and softer notes, sometimes being considered as &quot;conversational&quot; or &quot;intimate&quot; calls. Feathered eaglets tend to solicits food with a high pitched insistent &quot;wee-yik wee-yik, wee-yik&quot; call.

==Distribution and habitat==
The African hawk-eagle is found across much of sub-Saharan Africa. The farthest north the species ranges is in eastern Eritrea and adjacent areas of Ethiopia, after a substantial gap, the range resumes almost throughout southern Ethiopia. The African hawk-eagle tends to be scarce to rare in West Africa with much study of the details due to their local extreme scarcity. Here the species may be found into southern Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, eastern Guinea, northernmost Sierra Leone, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Burkina Faso, the northern portions of Ghana, Togo and Benin and north-central Nigeria. In central and East Africa, the range of the African hawk-eagle includes southern Chad, southern Sudan, where they tend to be fairly rare, South Sudan, west Somalia, the central and southern portions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and essentially all of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. This species is found throughout the northern nations (within favorable habitats) of southern Africa including Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, north-central Namibia, northern and eastern Botswana and northeastern South Africa, north of the Orange River. The species is gone or nearly so from Eswatini, with the last confirmed breeding having been in 2002. Despite claims of the species as far as the Cape Province in South Africa, this is almost certainly due to records of vagrants and no population likely exists in southern South Africa.

This is a bird of well-wooded countryside. This species tends to favor tropical broadleaf woodland and woodland edge within the savanna but does not tend to occur in true deep forest. Additionally, African hawk-eagles can adapt to thornbush areas such as the veld but tends to occur moreso within riparian zones, which tend to permit the growth of strips of taller trees. Miombo and especially Mopane woodland may be central to the existence of the species in southern Africa. As confirmed in study from Zimbabwe, more enclosed woodlands were avoided in favor of lower density woodlands. Overall, they tend to prefer fairly dry areas, but based on data from West Africa, Kenya and Botswana tend to prefer some moderate rainfall, with highly rainy areas such as Kenyan highlands tending to be avoided but also highly arid localities are avoided. Access to waterways, typically rivers, including ephemeral ones, and watering holes, is not infrequent, especially since they permit tall trees in otherwise fairly dry regions of Africa and also often hold concentrations of prey. Secondarily, they may be seen in fairly open, sparser savanna and assorted semi-desert areas whilst they generally avoid evergreen forests and mountainous areas. They have however been known to nest on cliff faces in Kenya but overall this is seldom-recorded and rare for this species, unlike in the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle. There are records of this species visiting (if not nesting in) cultivation such arables and pastureland and occasionally nesting in well-treed and low-disturbance plantations. However, this species typically seems to require protected areas to successfully propagate in. The African hawk-eagle has been documented from sea level to around , but mainly occurs below .

==Diet and hunting==

The African hawk-eagle is an uncommonly aggressive and bold predator. Their primary hunting tool is their powerful feet. In general, their sneaky foraging techniques recall a huge &quot;Accipiter&quot;. especially in terms of their short-distance flight after prey. Mostly the African hawk-eagle engages in still-hunting, wherein they scan from prey from an inconspicuous perch for a long period. When prey is spotted, the hawk-eagle engages in a low level dash from their perch in cover. They often uses cover to cloak their approach almost up the point where they strike. While it has been claimed that their flight is &quot;silent&quot;, it would presumably be more correct to say that the hunting hawk-eagle engages in minimal flapping flight so as to not alert prey to their approach. Often, the hawk-eagles wait near prey-concentrated areas, such as waterholes and among riparian trees for birds to come to drink or by clearings that birds frequently cross. African hawk-eagles may also quarter above the ground and seize any prey they surprise. They are capable of sometimes taking birds on the wing but usually prefer to catch them on the ground and may force avian prey intercepted in the air back to the ground. Often terrestrial birds are taken right around the moment they alight. In some instances, prey may be chased, even on foot, into thickets. African hawk-eagles have seldom been recorded engaging a stoop from soaring flight to capture prey. Pairs of African hawk-eagles often hunt together and in these circumstances seem to engage in deliberate cooperation, one distracting, the other striking. They share this tendency for hunting in pairs with their sister species, the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, which has been inferred to engage in tandem hunts possibly for sociosexual pairing reasons rather than for obtaining larger or more difficult prey, as is typically assumed of tandem-hunting raptors. One tandem hunting pair of African hawk-eagles appeared to remarkably make use of a mesh fence to drive guineafowl into in a cunning strategy to prevent their escape. Yet another pair of African hawk-eagles appears to derive much of its prey by regularly and opportunistically perching in a tree holding a fruit bat colony.

A trained African-hawk eagles can habitually kill European hares (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;) around in weight, and one eagles around kills a large male domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) around . However, It is clear that wild eagles are usually focusing on much smaller prey. The typical prey of African hawk-eagles tends to be medium to large-sized birds and small-to-medium-sized mammals. Less usual prey can include reptiles and insects. As much as 74-86% of the diet can be birds and as much as 54-70% of the diet can be mammals. In general, due to a combination of factors such as their usual practice of keeping their nest area clean and their tendency to often evade researchers&#x27; notice due to hidden perch sites, the diet of African hawk-eagles is less well-known than that of larger African eagles or the Bonelli&#x27;s eagles (especially in Europe). However, what is known suggests that this is an exceptionally powerful predator that may nearly rival much larger eagles such as martial eagles (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;) in its ability to take large and middle-sized prey. A general picture has emerged that the African hawk-eagle is highly opportunistic and takes any variety of appropriately sized prey as it becomes available. When the habitat is locally overgrazed such as in Namibia, data suggests birds decrease in importance and mammals increase. When taking mammalian prey, they may select any mammal weighing usually more than of up to . Largish ground feeding birds, such as francolins, spurfowls and guineafowls as well as mostly the smaller species of bustards and hornbills, seem to be the primary prey of African hawk-eagle. In Esigodini in Zimbabwe, it was found that 74% of the diet was birds. 69% of avian prey were found to be galliforms especially the helmeted guineafowl (&quot;Numida meleagris&quot;), which is of similar body size to the hawk-eagle itself, and Swainson&#x27;s spurfowl (&quot;Pternistis swainsonii&quot;), which is about half the size of a hawk-eagle, in addition to three more francolins and spurfowls. In the Matobo Hills of Zimbabwe and surrounding hilly country, the main prey by number were Natal spurfowl (&quot;Pternistis natalensis&quot;) at 48% of the diet but the main prey by biomass was hyraxes, at 51.3% (making up 29% by number) compared to the spurfowl which comprised 32.8% of the biomass. Both Zimbabwe studies shows that African hawk-eagles would habitually take mammalian prey larger than itself, including scrub hares (&quot;Lepus saxatilis&quot; ) of an estimated average of , and yellow-spotted rock hyrax (&quot;Heterohyrax brucei&quot;) and rarely Cape hyrax (&quot;Procavia capensis&quot;), of around with weights of infrequently up to . Large prey was primary in Tsavo East National Park, where the main prey was Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik (&quot;Madoqua kirkii&quot;), at 35% of the diet. Due to the low volume of nest that could be found and studied, only a few nests were examined for African hawk-eagles in Tsavo East and in these it was found that they principally took young dik-diks. Overall, the hawk-eagles estimated to take around 68 dik-diks annually in the park overall. Secondary prey in Tsavo East were red-crested korhaan (&quot;Lophotis ruficrista&quot;) (at 12.7%), common dwarf mongoose (&quot;Helogale parvula&quot;) (at 9.2%) and unstriped ground squirrel (&quot;Xerus rutilus&quot;) and eastern yellow-billed hornbill (&quot;Tockus flavirostris&quot;) (both at 7.2%). At a small sample from a nest in Namibia, 42% of the diet consisted of meerkat (&quot;Suricata suricatta&quot;). In the Northwest province of South Africa, the main prey were rock doves (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) (23.4%), Natal spurfowl (14%), 6.5% by unidentified doves and bush squirrels and 4.8% by Cape hyrax and crested francolins (&quot;Ortygornis sephaena&quot;). In Botswana, the main prey appeared to be hornbills, with one nest found to contain 25 southern yellow-billed hornbills (&quot;Tockus leucomelas&quot;) and only 5 southern red-billed hornbills (&quot;Tockus rufirostris&quot;) while elsewhere in the Zambezi Escarpment, the red-billed hornbills dominated the diet.

A small variety of different kinds of birds has been known to be taken opportunistically by African hawk-eagles. At times, they will prey on colonial nests of birds from weavers such as red-billed queleas (&quot;Quelea quelea&quot;) to herons. Seemingly infrequently taken birds have been known to include ostrich chicks, geese, plovers, cuckoos, herons and egrets, ibises, and a small diversity of passerines. Assorted birds taken with some frequency include grey go-away-birds (&quot;Crinifer concolor&quot;), brown-necked parrots (&quot;Poicephalus fuscicollis&quot;) and several species of dove. Domestic chickens (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) are sometimes taken in cultivated areas by African hawk-eagles, but the species is not thought to be as much of a poultry killer as it is made out to be. Other assorted mammals include a few species of squirrels and rats as well as fruit bats, bushbabies, and even those as small as Cape short-eared gerbil (&quot;Desmodillus auricularis&quot;). Larger mammals may include species each of mongoose to as large as the banded mongoose (&quot;Mungos mungo&quot;) and hare to as large as scrub hares, in many cases these may be as heavy or heavier than the hawk-eagle itself. Other large mammalian prey can include South African springhares (&quot;Pedetes capensis&quot;) and even small vervet monkeys (&quot;Chlorocebus pygerythrus&quot;). Besides smaller antelopes like dik-diks, the young of a few antelope are known to have been attacked by African hawk-eagles: klipspringers (&quot;Oreotragus oreotragus&quot;), steenboks (&quot;Raphicerus campestris&quot;) and lechwes (&quot;Kobus leche&quot;), the latter prey weighing an estimated and so perhaps the largest prey credited to the African hawk-eagle. Predation on reptiles seems to be fairly uncommon and few such prey are definitively identified, but both colubrid snakes and cobras are known to be included in their prey spectrum as well as lizards such as chameleons and giant plated lizards (&quot;Gerrhosaurus validus&quot;). One impressive reptilian prey item credited to an African hawk-eagle was a fairly large African rock python (&quot;Python sebae&quot;) seemingly taken alive, which would rival the largest mammalian prey in weight. Occasionally, this species is credited with insect predation, usually by juveniles, but it is not clear what variety of insects are consumed. Such prey must be considered very rare and may often be secondarily ingested from the stomachs of prey such as rodents and game birds. The African hawk-eagle is rarely reported to scavenge on carrion but one pair was seen to repeatedly feed on the carcass of a southern reedbuck (&quot;Redunca arundinum&quot;) over 3 days.
===Interspecific predatory relationships===

The African hawk-eagle exists in a highly competitive region for birds of prey. They are obligated to share prey with both smaller and larger raptorial birds and have overlapping habitat areas with them as well. In Tsavo East National Park, 50% of prey was shared with tawny eagles (&quot;Aquila rapax&quot;), 37% with bateleur (&quot;Terathopius ecaudatus&quot;) and 54% with martial eagles. Tawny eagles and bateleurs are about 25% larger in body mass than the African hawk-eagle while the martial eagle can be around three times larger than the hawk-eagle. The African hawk-eagle stands as the only of the four focused-on eagles in Tsavo East to nest apart from the other eagles due to habitat use, since it is the only one to use woodland over more lightly treed savanna, probably mitigating the most fierce of the competition. All four eagles mostly preyed on Kirk&#x27;s dik-diks in Tsavo East but also their nesting periods were slightly staggered with the bateleur nesting rather earlier in the year than the others on average and the African hawk-eagle on average nesting the latest, so that the primary pressure on dik-dik prey was naturally staggered. In the hill country of Zimbabwe, similarly the findings were that highly diverged nesting areas were used compared to other eagles, namely the primarily forest-nesting crowned eagle and primarily rock-nesting Verreaux&#x27;s eagle. All three eagles hunted hyraxes in the hilly areas for primary prey by weight, supplemented by young antelopes for crowned eagles and gamebirds (which were primary in number) for African hawk-eagles. However, the larger eagles (both more than twice as heavy than the hawk-eagle) primarily took hyraxes taken that were usually rather bigger than those taken by hawk-eagle, normally being at least for the crowned and the Verreaux&#x27;s while that was the very largest sizes hunted by the hawk-eagles. The African hawk-eagle was found to have the most diverse diet of the larger raptors of the region. Despite its staggered nesting areas from other eagles, it was evidenced in the hill country of Zimbabwe that the larger raptors such as the crowned and Verreaux&#x27;s eagles are attacked rather frequently, usually during flying bouts near the territories of the African hawk-eagles. These findings are consistent with elsewhere, showing that larger eagles are commonly attacked by the hawk-eagles, possibly either for competitive or mobbing purposes. The predators for the African hawk-eagle are not known and studies have indicated that adult hawk-eagles have little to fear and may fulfill the niche of an apex predator, albeit one that focuses on smaller prey typically than the considerably larger eagles it co-exists with. Predation on other birds of prey is rarely documented, unlike with Bonelli&#x27;s eagles, but the African hawk-eagle has been known to hunt down barn owls (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;) and black-winged kites (&quot;Elanus caeruleus&quot;).

==Behaviour and breeding==

The African hawk-eagle tends to be solitary but adults frequently occur in pairs, perhaps spending more time together than is typical of many raptors. Breeding territories are established with aerial displays, which are fairly uninvolved compared to some related species. The displays are usually little more than mutual circling with intermittent calling but males sometimes uncommonly do engage in sky dances, probably only in breeding displays rather than territorial exclusion displays. During the sky dance they engage in relatively shallow undulations with steep plunges and short rises with little wing flapping. In many cases, the male will dive towards the female and the female, in turn, turns to the male and displays her claws. This mating ritual culminates in the male presenting the female with nuptial gifts in the form of prey. This species is typically highly monogamous and it is quite typical for adults to pair for life. However, a potential case of polygyny may have occurred in Ethiopia. The breeding season occurs from October to April in the north of the Equator, while it is in February–June in The Gambia. In East Africa, the nesting season is often into April–January. In Uganda, egg laying was reported in September to November with a juvenile bird seen by January. Down to Botswana and northeastern South Africa the nesting season is somewhat variable, recorded from April to October, with egg-laying peaking in June according to one authority. Nesting is ultimately timed to line up with the regional dry season.

===Nest===
The nest tends to be a very substantial platform-like structure of large sticks. It is typically located in the main fork or well out on a lateral branch of a large tree. The height of the nest has been recorded as being from above the ground, generally falling somewhere between . In southern Africa, a nest at a height of was considered unusually low. Common tree species used as nests are &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Adansonia&quot;, &quot;Khaya&quot;, &quot;Terminalia&quot; and non-native &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;. Quite often, the nest trees are located in riparian areas. Rarely to exceptionally, nests may be placed elsewhere other than a tree. This seems to be case generally in East Africa where rare nests have been documented in a bush or on cliff ledge. In southern Africa sometimes nests have been placed on pylons. Nesting locations typically provide some shade but some nest sites are rather exposed, necessitating the shading of the eaglet by the female, even to a period longer than the nesting period. The nest itself is typically from deep or sometimes more, sometimes over with repeated additions. The interior cup of the nest is about with the overall nest diameter is up to about . Nests repairs consists of building up the rim after the previous years flattened, reinforcing by adding new layers of sticks. Building takes about 4 to 5 weeks and sometimes repairs as long as 8 weeks. It make take several months for a new nest&#x27;s construction. Limited observation suggests the male mate takes primary role in nest repair but the female may be more active in new nest construction. Females may add a majority of the fresh green leaves recorded in nests. The species tends to prefer a narrow breeding area with favorable habitat for nesting site, and in one extreme case the same general grove near Pretoria was used by different generations of hawk-eagles from 1912 to 1978. In Zimbabwe bushveld two nests were found apart, in Kruger National Park nests were estimated to be apart and in the well-wooded areas of the Matobos, nests were only apart.

===Eggs and incubation===
The African hawk-eagle usually lays a clutch of 2 eggs. More infrequently, a clutch of 1 to 3 eggs may be laid. In Zambia, 46% of nests had one egg, the remainder all had 2 in a sample of 13 nests. However, in Malawi, 80% of 15 nests had two eggs with only the remaining 20% having one. As of the early 1980s, only one recorded nest in southern Africa was said to contain a 3 egg clutch. The eggs have a chalky white ground color with very variable markings, varying from handsomely blotched speckled with dull rust-red to quite plain to showing coalesced markings on either end. The eggs can measure in height, averaging , by in diameter, averaging , in sample of 123. Only particularly large eggs are said to measure over high. The weight of eggs is reported , averaging some . The eggs in a multiple egg clutch are laid at about 3 or 4 day intervals, with the incubation beginning with the first egg laying. The incubation stage lasts for 42-44. The female does most of the incubation, relieved only for short spells by males who usually bring prey for her. Male incubation can be as long as an hour but usually much shorter. Over 28 hours of observation over 9 days at 2 nests, the females of the two pairs incubated a mean of 82.6% of the time to the males&#x27; 7.1%, while the remainder no incubation. Green leaves are still added by both members of the pair during incubation.

===Nesting and fledging stages===
A chick African hawk-eagle may take just under 2 days to hatch. Newly hatched eaglets are covered in dark grey down with whitish down on abdomen and thighs, with dull yellow cere and feet. The first coat of grey gives way to thicker and whiter 2nd coat, by 2 weeks only head and back have any grey down. By 3 weeks down predominantly white only head grey, with first remiges breaking out of quills. Feather development rapid at a month old and by 5 weeks well feathered below. At 6 weeks, the eaglet will only have remaining down on head, crop and abdomen, fully feathered by a week later but for wings and tails. The weight of 2 days old eaglets is about , about at 9 days, at 21 days, at 28 days, at 35 days, and at 49 days. In terms of developmental growth, at 5 days old, nestling African hawk-eagles are just barely able to preen themselves and by 11 days can move slightly around the nest. Young eaglets spend a great deal of the day sleeping and most awake activity involves preening and feeding. Only at the age of 24 days can the chicks defend the nest, stand reasonably well and make a few rather clumsy wing exercises; however at this stage they cannot tear meat off of the food that a parent provide. When the eaglet is 32 days old it is mainly attended to for feeding, stands well and exercises wings. At 50 days of age, the chicks show signs of fledging through being able to feed themselves and through flapping their wings. Around this stage they may preen quite a lot, nibble on sticks of the nest and make mock kills of prey bones and of sticks. Some of these activities are said to improve coordination. Fledgling begins at between 60 and 70 days of age, reports of as little as 41 days for fledgling are probably dubious. Post-nesting attachment to parental care is not long for a tropical raptor, typically lasting about 3 to 4 weeks. Thereafter, the young African hawk-eagle may be seen farther afield but then again some are seen in the company of their parents for as long as 2 months after fledging.

A 2008 study found that the first-born chick in a nest will crush, acquire more food than, and almost inevitably kill the second, smaller chick. The smaller chick typically has little chance of survival given the size differences of the two. In one case, the younger one weighed upon hatching, when its sibling was already , in another case the weights at the corresponding ages were and . This is a common occurrence in many bird species, particularly predatory birds, which allows for a chick to thrive and in the unlikely event that the first chick dies, there will be the second chick to propagate the species. According to a 1959 study, the instinct for two chicks to fight subsides after a few weeks thus if the second chick manages to survive for that long, the chances that it will fledge will be increased. The same paper suggests that intrabrood cannibalism likely follows a siblicide event. No cases of 2 successfully raised young were documented in southern Africa by the 1980s but two fledglings have been claimed produced in about 20% of Kenyan nests. The reasons for the discrepancies in the two regions is not well-understood.

===Parental behaviour===

Parental attention may be loosely divided into three main stages: from hatching up to 2 weeks, from 2–4 weeks and from 4 weeks to fledging. During the first period, the female largely remains on nest and broods a great deal, while, as at most stages, the male provides prey but then again has been known to brood and feed a small eaglet. Upon the 2nd week, the eaglet(s) are not nearly as closely brooded. In the second 2-4 week period, the female is at nest much less but she usually perches in nest tree, male still provides much of the prey and the female continues to feed, and shade if necessary, the eaglet. During the 3rd stage, parental time at nest drops much farther and the female may still sleep on the nest overnight but possibly apart from eaglet. Only at very late stage does female start to catch prey for eaglet. Nests tend to be kept very clear; with female known to disperse pellets elsewhere and much avian prey is brought well plucked, making prey identification difficult. The parent African hawk-eagles are known to highly aggressive in protecting their nest and regularly dive on threatening or novel animals who approach the nest. Humans are not infrequently attacked around the nest and especially if climbing towards the nest, resulting in potentially painful injuries. The species ranks as perhaps one of the most aggressive African eagles in defending its nest against humans, alongside the crowned eagle, and is much more prone to diving at humans than nesting Bonelli&#x27;s eagles.

===Breeding success and dispersal===
In a study conducted in Zimbabwe in 1988, 116 African hawk-eagle pairs were assessed in terms of breeding success in two areas of varying substrate quality. It was found that nests were placed in flat-crowned thorn trees in areas with basaltic soils and round-crowned, rough-barked trees in areas with sandy soil. Rainfall affected breeding success, laying dates and the sizes of clutches with higher success, later laying dates and larger clutch sizes correlating with higher rainfall. More breeding attempts were made in open woodland areas than in closed however the number of resulting chicks did not differ between vegetation structure. The African hawk-eagle is usually a rather sedentary and stable breeding raptor, seldom leaving a devoted area holding good prey numbers and habitat. However, one rather unsuccessful pair was recorded to have used 4 different sites in 9 years, atypical behavior for the species. Usually this species is able to breed annually, unlike many other African eagles. For instance, at a nest site in Zimbabwe there only 2 non breeding years in 17 years, productivity overall was 0.82 young per nest per year. Other nests in Zimbabwe often failed and egg infertility was a problem, mean overall productivity was 0.54. In Kenya, 15 young were produced in 27 pair years, productivity of 0.56 young per pair per year. The mortality of young African hawk-eagles, i.e. under 4 years old, may be extremely high in some localities, up to 75%, mainly due to assorted anthropogenic causes such as persecution and collisions with manmade objects such as wires. Despite the reputation for being sedentary, according to a 2006 book, juveniles of this species can disperse considerably from the breeding grounds. The mean distance for African hawk-eagles from their ringing as nestlings to recovery was in southern Africa. Similarly an adult hawk-eagle found dead in the Matobos was only away from its natal site. However, one ringed hawk-eagle was found to have moved a distance of from Limpopo in South Africa to Victoria Falls on the Zambia-Zimbabwe border, perhaps as a response to a prolonged dry spell and resulting diminishing food resources.

==Status==
The African hawk-eagle has a very wide range and is a relatively common species. No particular threats have been identified but the population is thought to be declining slowly. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;. BirdLife International estimated the total number of adults at around 100,000 birds, but that the supporting data are poor. In the former Transvaal province of South Africa the population of hawk-eagles was thought to be about 1,600 pairs, while overall in the southern African region an extrapolated total number of about 7,000 pairs was estimated. A 2006 study found that the African hawk eagle, among other raptor species have been declining at high rates outside of protected areas in West Africa and only seem to be stabilizing through the efforts of national parks. When numbers from 2003 to 2004 are compared to 1969-1973 in West Africa, it is found that numbers have declined even in protected areas. Overall negative population trends have also been detected for some time in southern Africa. Despite claims that declines in Malawi are due to persecution of the African hawk-eagle as a poultry thief, the much stronger cause is likely to be the pervasive destruction of woodlands. The declines are strong enough in southern Africa for the species to be thought to be extinct as breeding in Eswatini.

<text>The Buyid dynasty or Buyid Empire was a Zaydi and later Twelver Shi&#x27;a dynasty of Daylamite origin. Founded by Imad al-Dawla, they mainly ruled over central and southern Iran and Iraq from 934 to 1062. Coupled with the rise of other Iranian dynasties in the region, the approximate century of Buyid rule represents the period in Iranian history sometimes called the Iranian Intermezzo.

The Buyid dynasty was founded by Ali ibn Buya, who in 934 conquered Fars and made Shiraz his capital. He received the &quot;laqab&quot; or honorific title of &quot;Imad al-Dawla&quot; (). His younger brother, Hasan ibn Buya () conquered parts of Jibal in the late 930s, and by 943 managed to capture Ray, which he made his capital. Hasan was given the &quot;laqab&quot; of &quot;Rukn al-Dawla&quot; (). In 945, the youngest brother, Ahmad ibn Buya, conquered Iraq and made Baghdad his capital. He was given the laqab Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla.

As Iranians of Daylamite provenance, the Buyids consciously revived symbols and practices of the Sasanian Empire. Beginning with Imad al-Dawla, some of the Buyid rulers used the ancient Sasanian title of &quot;Shahanshah&quot;, literally &quot;king of kings&quot;. The Buyids had many inscriptions carved at the Achaemenid ruins of Persepolis, thus suggesting a form of veneration of the site, which the Buyids thought was built by the mythical Iranian king Jamshid.

The Buyid dynasty reached its zenith under Fannā Khusraw (), whose &quot;laqab&quot; was &quot;Adud al-Dawla&quot;. who is remembered for his open-mindedness and building projects such as the Band-e Amir dam near Shiraz. Under him, the Buyid realm stretched from the Byzantine border in Syria in the west to the borders of Khorasan in the east.

Although the Buyids were initially Zaydi Shia, they became Twelver Shia following the Major Occultation of Muhammad al-Mahdi after the death of his fourth agent in 941. Regardless, the Buyids were known for supporting the Sunni Abbasid caliphs and being tolerant of the Sunni population, who formed the majority of their realm. They were, by contrast, unfriendly towards the Fatimid Caliphate centered in Egypt, who were Isma&#x27;ilis.

Contrary to the Samanids, who ruled over a mostly Sunni Muslim population in Central Asia, the Buyid realm was populated by many Zoroastrians and Christians (primarily of the Church of the East). Because of this, many records written under the Buyids were composed in Middle Persian, Syriac and Arabic.

==Origins==
The word &quot;Būya&quot; (&quot;Buwayh&quot; in Arabic) is a Middle Persian name ending in the diminutive (Middle Persian &quot;-ōē&quot;, modern Persian &quot;-ūyeh&quot;, Arabic &quot;-uwayh&quot;). The Buyids were descendants of Panah-Khusrow, a Zoroastrian from Daylam. He had a son named Buya, who was a fisherman from Lahijan, and later left Zoroastrianism and converted to Islam. Buya later had three sons, named Ahmad, &#x27;Ali, and Hasan, who would later carve out the Buyid kingdom together. The Buyids claimed royal lineage from Bahram V (), the King of Kings (&quot;shahanshah&quot;) of the Sasanian Empire.

==History==

===Rise (934–945)===
The founder of the dynasty, &#x27;Ali ibn Buya, was originally a soldier in the service of the Daylamite warlord Makan ibn Kaki, but later changed his allegiance to the Iranian ruler Mardavij, who had established the Ziyarid dynasty, and was himself related to the ruling dynasty of Gilan, a region bordering Daylam. &#x27;Ali was later joined by his two younger brothers, Hasan ibn Buya and Ahmad ibn Buya. In 932, &#x27;Ali was given Karaj as his fief, and thus was able to enlist other Daylamites into his army. However, &#x27;Ali&#x27;s initiative proved too much for Mardavij, who planned to have him killed, but &#x27;Ali was informed of Mardavij&#x27;s plan by the latter&#x27;s own &quot;vizier&quot;. The brothers, with 400 of their Daylamite supporters, then fled to Fars, where they managed to take control of Arrajan. However, the Buyids and the Abbasid general Yaqut shortly fought for control of Fars, with the Buyids eventually emerging victorious. This victory opened the way for the conquest of the capital of Fars, Shiraz.

&#x27;Ali also allied with the landowners of Fars, which included the Fasanjas family, which would later produce many prominent statesmen for the Buyids. &#x27;Ali also enlisted more soldiers—including Turks, who were made part of the cavalry. &#x27;Ali then sent his brother Ahmad on an expedition to Kerman, but was forced to withdraw after opposition from the Baloch people and the Qafs. However, Mardavij, who sought to depose the Abbasid caliph of Baghdad and recreate a Zoroastrian Iranian Empire, shortly wrested Khuzestan from the Abbasids and forced &#x27;Ali to recognize him as his suzerain.

Luckily for the Buyids, Mardavij was assassinated shortly thereafter in 935, which caused chaos in the Ziyarid territories, a perfect situation for the Buyid brothers; Ali and Ahmad conquered Khuzistan, while Hasan captured the Ziyarid capital of Isfahan, and, in 943, captured Rey, which became his capital, thus conquering all of Jibal. In 945, Ahmad entered Iraq and made the Abbasid Caliph his vassal, at the same time receiving the laqab &quot;Mu&#x27;izz ad-Dawla&quot; (&quot;Fortifier of the State&quot;), while &#x27;Ali was given the laqab &quot;Imād al-Dawla&quot; (&quot;Support of the State&quot;), and Hasan was given the laqab &quot;Rukn al-Dawla&quot; (&quot;Pillar of the State&quot;).

===Height of power and Golden age (945–983)===

In addition to the other territories the Buyids had conquered, Kerman was conquered in 967, followed by Oman (967), the Jazira (979), Tabaristan (980), and Gorgan (981). After this, however, the Buyids went into a slow decline, with pieces of the confederation gradually breaking off and local dynasties under their rule becoming &quot;de facto&quot; independent.

===Decline and fall (983–1062)===
The death of Adud al-Dawla is considered the start of the decline of the Buyid dynasty; his son Abu Kalijar Marzuban, who was in Baghdad when he died, at first kept his death secret to ensure his succession and avoid civil war. When he eventually made the death of his father public, he was given the title of &quot;Samsam al-Dawla&quot;. However, Adud&#x27;s other son, Shirdil Abu&#x27;l-Fawaris, challenged his authority, and the feared civil war occurred anyway. Meanwhile, a Kurdish Marwanid chieftain named Badh ibn Dustak seized Diyabakr and forced Samsam al-Dawla to recognize him as the vassal ruler of the region. Furthermore, Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Dawla, son of and successor to Rukn al-Dawla, also died during this period. Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Dawla was succeeded by his brother Fakhr al-Dawla, who, with the aid of Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Dawla&#x27;s vizier Sahib ibn &#x27;Abbad, became the ruler of Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Dawla&#x27;s possessions. Another son of Adud al-Dawla, Abu Tahir Firuzshah, established himself as the ruler of Basra and took the title of &quot;Diya&#x27; al-Dawla&quot;, while another son, Abu&#x27;l-Husain Ahmad, established himself as the ruler of Khuzistan, taking the title of &quot;Taj al-Dawla&quot;.
Shirdil Abu&#x27;l-Fawaris (known by his title of &quot;Sharaf al-Dawla&quot;) quickly seized Oman from Samsam al-Dawla, and, in 983, the Turkic troops of Samsam al-Dawla mutinied against him and some left Iraq for Fars, but most of them were persuaded by his relative Ziyar ibn Shahrakawayh to stay in Iraq. However, Iraq was in a grim state, and several rebellions occurred, which he managed to suppress, the most dangerous being that of Asfar ibn Kurdawayh, who tried to make Abu Nasr Firuz Kharshadh (known by his title of &quot;Baha&#x27; al-Dawla&quot;) the ruler of Iraq. During the same period, Samsam al-Dawla also managed to seize Basra and Khuzistan, forcing his two brothers to flee to Fakhr al-Dawla&#x27;s territory.

During the mid-11th century, the Buyid amirates gradually fell to the Ghaznavids and Seljuk Turks. In 1029, Majd al-Dawla, who was facing an uprising by his Daylami troops in Ray, requested assistance from Mahmud of Ghazna. When Sultan Mahmud arrived, he deposed Majd al-Dawla, replaced him with a Ghaznavid governor and ended the Buyid dynasty in Ray.

In 1055, Tughril conquered Baghdad, the seat of the caliphate, and ousted the last of the Buyid rulers. Like the Buyids, the Seljuks kept the Abbasid caliphs as figureheads.

== Government ==
The Buyids established a confederation in Iraq and western Iran. This confederation formed three principalities: one in Fars, with Shiraz as its capital, the second one in Jibal, with Ray as its capital, and the last one in Iraq, with Baghdad as its capital. However, during their late period, more principalities formed in the Buyid confederation. Succession was hereditary, with rulers dividing their land among their sons.

The title used by the Buyid rulers was &quot;amir&quot;, meaning &quot;governor&quot; or &quot;prince&quot;. Generally, one of the amirs would be recognized as having seniority over the others; this individual would use the title of &quot;amir al-umara&quot;, or senior &quot;amir&quot;. Although the senior &quot;amīr&quot; was the formal head of the Būyids, he did not usually have any significant control outside of his amirate; each amir enjoyed a high degree of autonomy within his territories. As mentioned above, some stronger &quot;amirs&quot; used the Sassanid title of &quot;Shahanshah&quot;. Furthermore, several other titles such as &quot;malik&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), and &quot;malik al-muluk&quot; (&quot;king of kings&quot;), were also used by the Buyids. On a smaller scale, the Buyid territory was also ruled by princes from other families, such as the Hasanwayhids.

=== Military ===

During the beginning of the Buyid dynasty, their army consisted mainly of their fellow Daylamites, a warlike and brave people of mostly peasant origin, who served as foot soldiers. The Daylamites had a long history of military activity dating back to the Sasanian period, and had been mercenaries in various places in Iran and Iraq, and even as far as Egypt. The Daylamites, during a battle, normally bore a sword, a shield, and three spears. Furthermore, they were also known for their formidable shield formation, which was hard to break through.

However, when the Buyid territories increased, they began recruiting Turks into their cavalry, who had played a prominent role in the Abbasid military. The Buyid army also consisted of Kurds, who, along with the Turks, were Sunnis, while the Daylamites were Shi&#x27;i Muslims. However, the army of the Buyids of Jibal was mainly composed of Daylamites.

The Daylamites and Turks often quarrelled with each other for dominance within the army. To compensate their soldiers, the Buyid amīrs often distributed &quot;iqtāʾ&quot;s, or the rights to a percentage of tax revenues from a province (tax farming), although the practice of payment in kind was also frequently used. While the Turks were favoured in Buyid Iraq, the Daylamites were favoured in Buyid Iran.

==Culture==
===Language===
Contrary to the Samanids, the Buyids did not adopt Dari (also known as New Persian) as their official language. Instead, Arabic served as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of their realm, while Middle Persian was occasionally used as a secondary court language. Although the Buyids were of Iranian stock, they supported writing in Arabic, and also used the language in their correspondence, as well as poetry. 
It is uncertain why the Buyids did not promote the use of New Persian. According to the historians Edmund Herzig and Sarah Stewart in their book &quot;Early Islamic Iran&quot; (2011), it may have been due to three factors; the Buyids had been influenced during their stay in Baghdad and thus aspired to be important supporters of Arabic writing; New Persian may have been discouraged by the Zoroastrian priests, who still wrote in Middle Persian in regions such as Fars; New Persian may have been very different/at odds with the dialects of western Iran, and was only mostly welcomed in eastern Iran.

However, New Persian was still used as language of poetry at the Buyid courts. Many prominent poets in the Buyid realm wrote in New Persian, such as Abu Muhammad Mansur ibn Ali al-Mantiqi al-Razi, Khusrawi Sarakhsi and Abu Zayd Muhammad ibn Ali al-Ghada&#x27;iri al-Razi. The Persian vizier Sahib ibn Abbad (died 995), who was the leading figure at the Buyid court at Ray for a lengthy period, wrote only in Arabic, which he preferred instead of his native tongue. However, he also accepted New Persian panegyrics that were dedicated to him.

The Buyids also promoted the use of &quot;fahlaviyat&quot;, a designation for poetry composed in the local northwestern Iranian dialects and languages. Due to having a large Zoroastrian and Christian population, many records written under the Buyids were composed in Middle Persian, Syriac and Arabic.

=== Naming traditions, celebrations and identity ===
While the brothers that established the Buyid kingdom had the Arabic names of Ali, Hasan, and Ahmad, the second Buyid generation notably had Iranian names, such as Kamrava, Marzuban, Bahram and Khusraw. The Buyids had many inscriptions carved at the Achaemenid ruins of Persepolis, thus suggesting a form of veneration of the site, which the Buyids thought was built by the mythical Iranian king Jamshid. Adud al-Dawla celebrated the ancient Iranian festivals of Sadeh and Mehregan, and like many previous Islamic rulers—including the caliphs—he most likely celebrated Nowruz as well. He used Nowruz as a model for two newly created festivals, which were celebrated annually in the town of Fana Khusraw-gird.

Under the Buyids, the idea of &quot;Iranshahr&quot; (Iran) appears in geographical works, which were all written in Arabic by mostly Iranian authors. The geographer Istakhri, who was active in the late 10th-century and wrote; &quot;The best cultivated (&quot;ma‘mur&quot;), fairest and most fertile part of the world, and the most established in its political life is the kingdom of Iranshahr.&quot;

Herzig and Stewart adds that;

==Religion==
Like most Daylamites at the time, the Buyids were Shia and have been called Twelvers. However, it is likely that they began as Zaydis. Moojen Momen explains this transition from Zaydism to Twelverism, by noting that, since the Buyids were not descendants of Ali, the first Shi&#x27;i Imam, Zaydism would have required them to install an Imam from Ali&#x27;s family. So, Buyids tended toward Twelverism, which has an occulted Imam, a more politically attractive option to them.

The Buyids rarely attempted to enforce a particular religious view upon their subjects except in matters where it would be politically expedient. The Sunni Abbasids retained the caliphate but were deprived of all secular power. In addition, to prevent tensions between the Shia and the Sunnis from spreading to government agencies, the Buyid amirs occasionally appointed Christians to high offices instead of Muslims from either sect.

== Architecture ==
Under the supervision of the Buyids, large construction and engineering projects took place, such as irrigation systems and agricultural developments, all of which led to an increase in income. In comparison to other local rulers in Iraq, particularly the Baridis and Hamdanids, it was clear that the Buyids had a liking to construction projects. When Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla arrived in Iraq, the country had been ravaged as a result of local struggles over control of Baghdad. Under his instructions, the Baduriya dam on the Rufayl river was restored, subsequently resulting in lower prices of common foods, such as bread. This also inspired people to migrate to Baghdad.

It was during the reign of Adud al-Dawla that most of the Buyid construction and restoration projects took place. Under him, Shiraz became so crowded that the garrison had no place to roam, which led Adud al-Dawla to have a special quarter created, Fana Khusraw-gird (&quot;Fana Khusraw made it&quot;), a name which deliberately reflected the name of towns established by the Sasanian kings. The town of Firuzabad, considered to be linked to the Sasanian king Ardashir I (), was revamped by Adud al-Dawla, possibly done in order to stress his claim to Sasanian ancestry. One of Adud al-Dawla&#x27;s lasting building projects was the mausoleum erected on the burial place of Ali.

==Buyid rulers==

<text>Green Acres is an American television absurdist sitcom starring Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor as a couple who move from New York City to a country farm. Produced by Filmways as a sister show to &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, the series was first broadcast on CBS, from September 15, 1965, to April 27, 1971.

Although it received solid ratings during its six-year run, &quot;Green Acres&quot; was cancelled in 1971 as part of the &quot;rural purge&quot; by CBS. The sitcom has been in syndication and is available on DVD and VHS releases. A reunion movie aired in 1990.

In 1997, the two-part episode &quot;A Star Named Arnold Is Born&quot; was ranked No. 59 on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.

== Radio origins ==
&quot;Green Acres&quot; derives from &quot;Granby&#x27;s Green Acres&quot;, a comedy show aired on the CBS radio network from July 3 to August 21, 1950. The eight-episode summer series was created by Jay Sommers, who also wrote, produced, and directed.

The principal characters, a married couple played by Bea Benaderet and Gale Gordon, originated (although under a different surname) on Lucille Ball&#x27;s &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. The &quot;Granby&#x27;s&quot; premise was that a big-city banker fulfills a lifelong dream by moving his family to a rundown farm, despite knowing nothing about farming. The nearby feed store is operated by the absent-minded Mr. Kimball, and the Granbys hire an older hand named Eb (voiced by Parley Baer, who guest-starred in several episodes of the television series), who often comments on incompetent management. Benaderet later played Kate Bradley, a main character in &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, which was in the same fictional universe as &quot;Green Acres&quot;.

==Adaptation to television==
Following the success of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, CBS offered producer Paul Henning another half-hour slot on the schedule, without requiring a pilot episode. Faced with running three shows, Henning encouraged Sommers to create a series for the time slot. Sommers later wrote and produced about one-third of the episodes.

In pre-production, proposed titles were &quot;Country Cousins&quot; and &quot;The Eddie Albert Show&quot;.

==Premise==

&quot;Green Acres&quot; is about Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert), a prominent and wealthy New York City attorney, fulfilling his dream to be a farmer, and Lisa Douglas (Eva Gabor), his glamorous Hungarian wife, uprooted unwillingly from an upscale Manhattan penthouse apartment to a dilapidated farm in Hooterville that Oliver purchases from the ever-hustling Mr. Haney, to the disbelief of the residents.

The debut episode is a mockumentary about their decision to move to a rural area, anchored by former ABC newscaster John Charles Daly. Daly was the host of the CBS game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, and a few weeks after the show&#x27;s debut Albert and Gabor returned the favor by appearing on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; as that episode&#x27;s Mystery Guests, and publicly thanked Daly for helping to launch their series.

Although many &quot;Green Acres&quot; episodes were still standard 1960s sitcom fare, the show developed a regular undercurrent of surrealism and satire. The writers soon developed a suite of running jokes and visual gags, and characters often broke the fourth wall, such as looking around to try and figure out where the fife music is coming from when Oliver launches into one of his frequent &quot;American dream&quot; monologues.

The show is set in the same television universe as Henning&#x27;s &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, featuring such towns as Hooterville, Pixley, Crabwell Corners, and Stankwell Falls, as well as sharing characters such as Joe Carson, Fred and Doris Ziffel, Sam Drucker, Newt Kiley, and Floyd Smoot.

===Theme song===
The main theme, composed by Vic Mizzy, is notable as an unusual example of a TV theme song in which the lyrics are sung by the stars of the show (Albert and Gabor), rather than by anonymous session vocalists.

==Characters==
===Main characters ===

* Oliver Wendell Douglas (portrayed by Eddie Albert) - Named for Oliver Wendell Holmes, he is an attorney who makes the rash decision to leave his successful law practice and pursue his lifelong dream of being a farmer, despite having no real-world knowledge or experience, as evidenced by him doing farm chores while wearing a three-piece suit (in &quot;The Hooterville Image,&quot; the denizens decide Oliver is ruining the town&#x27;s image by doing his chores in a suit and demand that he wear overalls). Much of the humor throughout the series derives from Oliver&#x27;s striving toward success and happiness in an absurd situation, despite the rural citizenry, his high-maintenance wife, and his affluent mother (Eleanor Audley), who ridicules him for his agricultural pipedreams in the episode &quot;The Wedding Anniversary.&quot; Oliver is also subjected to ribbing by the Hootervillians when he launches into starry-eyed monologues about &quot;the American farmer&quot;—replete with a fife playing &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; in the background (which every on-screen character except Oliver can hear). Oliver drives a Lincoln Continental convertible, a stark contrast to the often decrepit vintage vehicles generally shown. In later seasons, the Lincoln is replaced by a Mercury Marquis convertible. 
* Lisa Douglas (portrayed by Eva Gabor) - Lisa and Oliver are both veterans of World War II. In &quot;Wings Over Hooterville,&quot; she recalls how they met. According to Lisa, she was a sergeant in the Hungarian underground, and he was a United States Army Air Forces flier, forced to bail out of his plane. However, she gives several other fanciful versions of how they met in subsequent episodes. In the episode, &quot;A Royal Love Story,&quot; he is a tourist in Paris, and she is a waitress/tour guide, living with her father, the deposed King of Hungary. Pampered by her wealthy family, her skewed world view and domestic ignorance provide fertile ground for recurring gags. Instead of washing dishes, Lisa sometimes tosses them out the kitchen window. In the episode, &quot;Alf and Ralph Break Up,&quot; Lisa admits she has no cooking abilities and that her only talent is Zsa Zsa Gabor impersonations (the real-life sisters were often mistaken for each other).

Oliver and Lisa are both depicted as fish out of water. While Oliver instigated the move from Manhattan to Hooterville over Lisa&#x27;s objections, he is typically uncomprehending of and impatient with his new situation. Lisa, on the other hand, somehow understands the sometimes surreal world of their neighbors, and they in turn are accepting of her own bizarre notions.

===Supporting characters===
* Mr. Eustace Haney (portrayed by Pat Buttram) - The oily, dishonest local salesman and grifter who originally sold Oliver the Green Acres Farm (previously the Old Haney Place). In the early episodes, Haney repeatedly profits from Oliver by removing all the farm&#x27;s basic fittings and equipment (the kitchen sink, bath, stove, cow, tractor, plow, etc.), and selling or renting them back to Oliver at wildly inflated prices. In succeeding episodes, Haney invariably arrives on cue every time Oliver needs an item or service, typically accompanied by a custom-made sign for each occasion, painted on a green pull-down window shade. Pat Buttram later revealed that Haney&#x27;s character was inspired by Elvis Presley&#x27;s manager Colonel Tom Parker.
* Eb Dawson (portrayed by Tom Lester) - The amiable, somewhat naïve, sarcastic young farmhand to the Douglases. He habitually addresses the Douglases as &quot;Dad&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot;, much to Oliver&#x27;s annoyance.
* Fred Ziffel (portrayed by Hank Patterson) and Doris Ziffel (portrayed by Barbara Pepper 1965–1968, Fran Ryan 1969–1971) - Fred and Doris are the Douglases&#x27; childless elderly neighbors. They have a pig named Arnold, whom they treat as their son. Fred is a cantankerous old-fashioned farmer who was born during the Grover Cleveland administration. Everything about him is &quot;no-nonsense&quot;, except for the fact that his &quot;son&quot; Arnold is a pig.
* Arnold Ziffel - Arnold is a pig whom the Ziffels treat as a son, understands English, lives indoors, and is pampered. Everyone understands Arnold when he grunts, as if he were speaking English, except Oliver. He is an avid TV watcher and a Western fan, attends the local grade school (carrying his book pack in his mouth), and signs his own name on paper. Only Oliver believes Arnold is just livestock, although he frequently slips and begins treating him as a boy. Arnold makes regular appearances throughout the series, often visiting the Douglas home to watch their TV.
* Alf and Ralph Monroe (portrayed by Sid Melton and Mary Grace Canfield) - Alf and his &quot;brother&quot; Ralph are two quarrelsome carpenters. In the episode that introduces them, Alf confesses that Ralph is actually his sister and explains they would not get jobs if people knew that she is a woman. The Monroes rarely finish projects and those that they do complete are disasters such as the Douglases&#x27; bedroom closet&#x27;s sliding door that is always falling down, their unsuccessful attempts to secure the doorknob to the front door, etc. In one episode after accidentally sawing Sam Drucker&#x27;s telephone line at the general store, they splice it back together, although backwards, causing Drucker to listen at the mouthpiece and talk into the receiver. Melton left in 1970 (season four) to do &quot;Make Room For Granddaddy&quot;, so the writers developed an occasional subplot that involved sister Ralph&#x27;s attempts to win the affections of &quot;Hanky&quot; Kimball or some other hapless Hooterville bachelor. Alf later returns for Ralph&#x27;s failed wedding to Kimball.
* Sam Drucker (portrayed by Frank Cady) - A shopkeeper who is a regular character in both &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and &quot;Green Acres.&quot; Drucker also serves as a newspaper editor and printer, volunteer firefighter with the Hooterville Volunteer Fire Department, notary, constable, justice of the peace, and postmaster. Sam is the editor of the &quot;Hooterville World Guardian&quot;, the valley&#x27;s only newspaper. Drucker is often the only character who is inspired by Oliver&#x27;s rural patriotism. He is arguably the most &quot;normal&quot; of the Hooterville citizenry and he often filters Oliver&#x27;s idealism to the townsfolk and, conversely, filters the plebeian backwoods notions of the community back to Oliver.
* Hank Kimball (portrayed by Alvy Moore) - A broad parody of regional government bureaucrats and civil service employees, Hank is an often confused county agricultural agent who draws folks into inane conversations, loses his train of thought, then exits the scene. Kimball often begins a conversation, then questions the veracity of his own statements and ends up making a statement totally opposite from his original comment. The series was reportedly one of the first pre-recorded sitcoms to use teleprompters extensively during filming and Moore later recounted that he found them invaluable when performing Kimball&#x27;s convoluted, rambling, rapid-fire dialogue.
* Eunice Douglas (portrayed by Eleanor Audley) - Eunice is Oliver&#x27;s mother, who seems to side with her daughter-in-law far more than her son. She is aghast at the prospect of Oliver and Lisa moving to Hooterville and often tries to convince Lisa to come back to New York City with her (or as she puts it, &quot;Come back to America&quot;) and escape the primitive life of the farm. Eunice is a recurring character on the first four seasons of the show. Audley&#x27;s role has been compared to a recurring character she also played on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; as Millicent Schuyler-Potts, headmistress of the Potts School where Jethro attends the fifth and sixth grades.
* Lori Baker (portrayed by Victoria Paige Meyerink) - A young girl who lives with her aunt and visited Hooterville with four other kids. After the other kids went home, she stayed with Oliver and Lisa for a while.

===The folks from Petticoat Junction===
Shady Rest Hotel owner Kate Bradley (portrayed by Bea Benaderet) appears in a few early episodes. She tries to help Lisa adapt to country living, most notably giving her the recipe for her hotcakes, which Lisa ends up botching, resulting in Lisa&#x27;s infamous &quot;hotscakes&quot;. Uncle Joe Carson (portrayed by Edgar Buchanan) is seen at times playing checkers, loafing, or mooching fruit at Drucker&#x27;s Store with &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; regulars Newt Kiley (portrayed by Kay E. Kuter) and train conductor Floyd Smoot (portrayed by Rufe Davis) while also developing a romantic interest in Eunice Douglas. Betty Jo Bradley appears in one episode as Eb Dawson&#x27;s date. Her sister Bobbie Jo appears in the same episode. Blonde-haired Billie Jo is the only Bradley sister never to appear in &quot;Green Acres&quot;. Western film actor Smiley Burnette guest-stars several times as railway engineer Charley Pratt in 1965 and 1966. Burnette and Pat Buttram (Mr. Haney) were both comic sidekicks of singing cowboy Gene Autry in his 1950s Westerns.

===Crossovers with &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;===
In the March 1967, episode &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (season 2, episode 23), the Hooterville theater puts on a play in &quot;homage&quot; to &quot;famous television show&quot; &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Oliver plays Jethro opposite Lisa as Granny Clampett.

Starting in 1968, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; aired episodes with the Clampetts in Hooterville visiting distant cousins the Bradley family. This brought the world of all three shows into the same reality. &quot;The Thanksgiving Story&quot; includes a split-second insert of Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor at the dinner table with the casts of all three series. There is a subplot with Eb Dawson falling in love with Elly May Clampett that continues in the following episode, &quot;The Courtship of Homer Noodleman&quot;. The Clampetts return to the Shady Rest Hotel in &quot;Christmas in Hooterville&quot; with Eb still fawning over a reluctant Elly May.

=== Guest stars ===
During its six-season run, many familiar actors guest-starred on the show, along with other lesser-known performers who later achieved stardom, among them John Daly, Elaine Joyce, Gary Dubin, Herbert Anderson, June Foray, Bob Cummings, Sam Edwards, Jerry Van Dyke, J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, Johnny Whitaker, Jesse White, Al Lewis, Gordon Jump, Bernie Kopell, Len Lesser, Bob Hastings, Don Keefer, Don Porter, Alan Hale Jr., Melody Patterson, Rusty Hamer, Regis Toomey, Heather North, Allan Melvin, Parley Baer, Jack Bannon, Reginald Gardiner, Rick Lenz, Al Molinaro, Pat Morita, and Rich Little in a cameo as himself.

== Cancellation ==

In 1970–1971, during the series&#x27; sixth season, &quot;Green Acres&quot; placed 34th out of 96 shows. Despite the respectable ratings and winning its timeslot, the network cancelled the show in the spring of 1971 after 170 episodes.

CBS at the time was under mounting pressure from sponsors to have more urban-themed programs on its schedule. To make room for the newer shows, nearly all of the rural-themed shows were cancelled, later known as the &quot;rural purge,&quot; of which Pat Buttram said, &quot;CBS cancelled everything with a tree – including &quot;Lassie&quot;.&quot;

As a result of the sudden cancellation, there was no series finale. The final two episodes of &quot;Green Acres&quot; were backdoor pilots for two shows that were never picked up by a network. In the penultimate episode of season 6 (&quot;Hawaiian Honeymoon&quot;), Oliver and Lisa take a trip to Hawaii. Most of the episode focuses on hotel owner Bob Carter (Don Porter) and his daughter Pam (Pamela Franklin), thus the proposed title for the new series was simply &quot;Pam&quot;. The final episode of season six (and ultimately the &quot;Green Acres&quot; series) heavily featured Oliver&#x27;s former secretary in Manhattan, Carol Rush (Elaine Joyce), with proposed spinoff titles said to be &quot;Carol&quot; or &quot;The Blonde&quot;.

== Revivals ==
The surviving members of the cast (except for Eleanor Audley, who had retired from acting 20 years earlier) were reunited for a TV movie titled &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot;. It aired on CBS on May 18, 1990. Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor also recreated their &quot;Green Acres&quot; characters for the 1993 CBS special &quot;The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

On November 19, 2007, original series director Richard L. Bare announced that he was working on a revival of &quot;Green Acres&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; announced on July 22, 2012, that a Broadway-aimed musical was in development, with an initial draft of the book written by Bare. No composer, lyricist, or director was attached. Bare died in 2015.

== Home media ==
MGM Home Entertainment released the first three seasons of &quot;Green Acres&quot; on Region 1 DVD. The entire six-season run of the series is available for purchase via Amazon&#x27;s video-on-demand service.

On July 7, 2017, Shout! Factory announced it had acquired the rights to release future seasons of the show. It subsequently released &quot;Green Acres – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on October 17, 2017.

Shout! Factory released season 4 on November 28, 2017. They released season 5 on February 27, 2018, followed by season 6 on July 10, 2018. A DVD &amp; Blu-ray released on Studio Distribution Services its 35th anniversary.

== Reunion film ==
In the 1990 reunion TV movie &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot;, made and set two decades after the series, Oliver and Lisa have moved back to New York but are miserable there. The Hootervillians implore the couple to return and save the town from a scheme to destroy it, cooked up between Mr. Haney and a wealthy, underhanded developer (Henry Gibson). The Monroe brothers still have not finished the Douglases&#x27; bedroom, while a 20-something Arnold survived his &quot;parents&quot; and subsequently bunks with his &quot;cousin&quot;, the Ziffels&#x27; comely niece. With a nod to the times, Haney&#x27;s latest product is a Russian miracle fertilizer called &quot;Gorby Grow&quot;. The film was distributed by Orion Television Entertainment, the successor to Filmways.

== Film and Broadway adaptation ==
In January 1997, it was announced a film adaptation of &quot;Green Acres&quot; was in development at Fox Family Films with a script by E. Jack Kaplan and Richard Chapman and Bette Midler in the role of Lisa Douglas. By December of that year, Midler had dropped out of the project with Ben Stiller joining the project through his company Red Hour Productions to star and possibly direct with an intent on taking a more irreverent direction with the material. In October 1998, it was reported that Robert Cohen was writing a new draft of the script. Until his death in March 2015, Bare was working on a film version of the TV series, and he teamed with Phillip Goldfine and his Hollywood Media Bridge to produce it. A Broadway version was also in development.

== Recognition ==
In 1984, the USC School of Cinematic Arts gave a retrospective of &quot;Green Acres&quot; to honor Sommers.

<doc id="577296" wikidata="Q220717" url="?curid=577296" title="Mass concentration (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, astrophysics and geophysics, a mass concentration (or mascon) is a region of a planet&#x27;s or moon&#x27;s crust that contains a large positive gravity anomaly. In general, the word &quot;mascon&quot; can be used as a noun to refer to an excess distribution of mass on or beneath the surface of an astronomical body (compared to some suitable average), such as is found around Hawaii on Earth. However, this term is most often used to describe a geologic structure that has a positive gravitational anomaly associated with a feature (e.g. depressed basin) that might otherwise have been expected to have a negative anomaly, such as the &quot;mascon basins&quot; on the Moon.

==Lunar mascons==
The Moon is the most gravitationally &quot;lumpy&quot; major body known in the Solar System. Its largest mascons can cause a plumb bob to hang about a third of a degree off vertical, pointing toward the mascon, and increase the force of gravity by one-half percent.

Typical examples of mascon basins on the Moon are the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium and Orientale impact basins, all of which exhibit significant topographic depressions and positive gravitational anomalies. Examples of mascon basins on Mars are the Argyre, Isidis, and Utopia basins. Theoretical considerations imply that a topographic low in isostatic equilibrium would exhibit a slight negative gravitational anomaly. Thus, the positive gravitational anomalies associated with these impact basins indicate that some form of positive density anomaly must exist within the crust or upper mantle that is currently supported by the lithosphere. One possibility is that these anomalies are due to dense mare basaltic lavas, which might reach up to 6 kilometers in thickness for the Moon. While these lavas certainly contribute to the observed gravitational anomalies, uplift of the crust-mantle interface is also required to account for their magnitude. Indeed, some mascon basins on the Moon do not appear to be associated with any signs of volcanic activity. Theoretical considerations in either case indicate that all the lunar mascons are super-isostatic (that is, supported above their isostatic positions). The huge expanse of mare basaltic volcanism associated with Oceanus Procellarum does not possess a positive gravitational anomaly.

===Origin of lunar mascons===
Since their identification in 1968 by Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft, the origin of the mascons beneath the surface of the Moon has been subject to much debate, but they are now regarded as being the result of the impact of asteroids during the Late Heavy Bombardment.

===Effect of lunar mascons on satellite orbits===
Lunar mascons alter the local gravity above and around them sufficiently that low and uncorrected lunar orbits of satellites around the Moon are unstable on a timescale of months or years. The small perturbations in the orbits accumulate and eventually distort the orbit enough for the satellite to impact the surface.

Because of its mascons, the Moon has only four &quot;frozen orbit&quot; inclination zones where a lunar satellite can stay in a low orbit indefinitely. Lunar subsatellites were released on two of the last three Apollo crewed lunar landing missions in 1971 and 1972; the subsatellite PFS-2 released from Apollo 16 was expected to stay in orbit for one and a half years, but lasted only 35 days before crashing into the lunar surface since it had to be deployed in a much lower orbit than initially planned. It was only in 2001 that the mascons were mapped and the frozen orbits were discovered.

The Luna 10 orbiter was the first artificial object to orbit the Moon, and it returned tracking data indicating that the lunar gravitational field caused larger than expected perturbations, presumably due to &quot;roughness&quot; of the lunar gravitational field. The Lunar mascons were discovered by Paul M. Muller and William L. Sjogren of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1968 from a new analytic method applied to the highly precise navigation data from the uncrewed pre-Apollo Lunar Orbiter spacecraft. This discovery observed the consistent 1:1 correlation between very large positive gravity anomalies and depressed circular basins on the Moon. This fact places key limits on models attempting to follow the history of the Moon&#x27;s geological development and explain the current lunar internal structures.

At that time, one of NASA&#x27;s highest priority &quot;tiger team&quot; projects was to explain why the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft being used to test the accuracy of Project Apollo navigation were experiencing errors in predicted position of ten times the mission specification (2 kilometers instead of 200 meters). This meant that the predicted landing areas were 100 times as large as those being carefully defined for reasons of safety. Lunar orbital effects principally resulting from the strong gravitational perturbations of the mascons were ultimately revealed as the cause. William Wollenhaupt and Emil Schiesser of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston then worked out the &quot;fix&quot; that was first applied to Apollo 12 and permitted its landing within 163 m (535 ft) of the target, the previously landed Surveyor 3 spacecraft.

===Mapping===
In May 2013 a NASA study was published with results from the twin GRAIL probes, that mapped mass concentrations on Earth&#x27;s Moon.

China&#x27;s Chang’e 5T1 mission also mapped Moon&#x27;s mascons. 
==Earth&#x27;s mascons==
Mascons on Earth are often measured by means of satellite gravimetry, such as the GRACE satellites.
Mascons are often reported in terms of a derived physical quantity called &quot;equivalent water thickness&quot;, &quot;equivalent water height&quot;, or &quot;water equivalent height&quot;, obtained dividing the surface mass density redistribution by the density of water.

==Mercurian mascons==
Mascons exist on Mercury. They were mapped by the MESSENGER spacecraft which orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015. Two are shown in the image at right, at Caloris Planitia and at Sobkou Planitia.

<doc id="577299" wikidata="Q806096" url="?curid=577299" title="FasTrak">
<text>FasTrak is the electronic toll collection (ETC) system used in the state of California in the United States. The system is used statewide on all of the toll roads, toll bridges, and high-occupancy toll lanes along the California Freeway and Expressway System.

As with other ETC systems, FasTrak is designed to eliminate the need for cars to stop to pay at toll booths, thus decreasing the traffic congestion traditionally associated with toll roads. Its use of technology to improve transit is in line with the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Intelligent Transportation Systems initiative.

California&#x27;s toll facilities are decentralized and operated by various local public agencies and special-purpose districts instead of having them all directly under the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) or another state government agency. Concerned that they would each introduce different, incompatible ETC systems, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill 1523 in 1990, requiring Caltrans to develop a statewide specification that all these toll agencies were required to meet. Three years later, Transportation Corridor Agencies opened the Foothill Toll Road in Orange County, implementing the statewide ETC system for the first time, and naming it FasTrak. The state continues to delegate the responsibility of selling and maintaining FasTrak accounts to the different toll agencies.

==Operations and functionality==
===Technology===
Under California law, Caltrans was given the mandate to develop and maintain an open, statewide ETC specification. This specification became known in the transportation industry as &quot;Title 21&quot; after it was added to Title 21 of the &quot;California Code of Regulations&quot;. It uses RFID technology near 915 MHz to read data from a transponder placed in a vehicle (usually mounted by Velcro strips to the windshield) moving at speeds that may exceed 70 mph (112 km/h). The RFID transponder in each vehicle is associated with a prepaid debit account; each time the vehicle passes underneath a toll collection site, the account is debited to pay the toll.

FasTrak transponders using the Title 21 specifications are not compatible with E-ZPass and other ETC systems used in other states. Under MAP-21, passed by the Federal government in 2012, all ETC facilities in the United States were supposed to reach some form of interoperability in 2016. However, neither penalties nor funding was attached to MAP-21, and therefore California did not meet the deadline. State regulators later approved a phase-in of transponder technology using the ISO/IEC 18000-63 (6C) standard, which began in 2018 and is expected to end in 2024. This would allow compatibility with systems used in nearby states of Washington, Colorado, and Utah; and also Kentucky, Indiana, Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana, plus NationalPass.

If a vehicle does not have a transponder, or if a transponder is not detected at the toll plaza, a violation enforcement system triggers cameras that capture photos of the vehicle and its license plate for processing. If the license plate is registered as belonging to a FasTrak user, the account is debited only the toll charge, and no penalty is charged, but no HOV discounts that would have required a FasTrak Flex tag are given. This is a backup in case a transponder fails to read. Otherwise, for a designated FasTrak-only facility, including most express lanes, a toll violation notice is sent to the registered owner of the vehicle, or in the case of a non-Fastrak-only facility, including all toll bridges, an invoice (with no penalty) is sent to the registered owner. In the case of drivers whose vehicles are company owned or leased, as long as the vehicle license plates are properly listed, the violations will be sent to the registered owner and not the employee driver. It is for this reason that the License Agreement mandates that customers list all vehicles, including motorcycles, motor homes, and trailers of all types on their accounts so that when transponders fail to read the toll can be debited based upon the vehicle&#x27;s license plate. A license plate may be listed only on one account.

A toll collected based on a license plate is called an image toll and can be identified on the customer statement by noticing the license plate number listed instead of the transponder number. If one fails to correctly list license plates on their account, the FasTrak customer will receive toll violation notices as if they were another driver. If a FasTrak customer receives a toll violation notice under these circumstances, they only refer to the reverse side of the Toll Violation notice and complete the section at the bottom of the notice that will add the new vehicle to their account. Conversely, a license plate should be removed from an account after a change in ownership, otherwise resulting in paying for another driver&#x27;s tolls via the Image Toll process.

===Toll agencies===
The California Toll Operators Committee (CTOC) helps coordinates the interoperability among the state&#x27;s toll agencies and facilities. The CTOC&#x27;s members include:
* Alameda County Transportation Commission, operator of the I-580 and I-680 high-occupancy toll lanes in Alameda County.
* Bay Area Toll Authority, operator of the seven state-owned toll bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area.
* Bay Area Infrastructure Financing Authority, a joint powers authority of the Bay Area Toll Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. Operates the I-880 high-occupancy toll lanes in Alameda County and the I-680 high-occupancy toll lanes in Contra Costa County. Coordinates with other agencies on the overall San Francisco Bay Area toll lanes network
* California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), maintains the state highway system and coordinates with the other toll agencies, but does not necessarily plan and operate the toll facilities directly.
* Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, operator of the Golden Gate Bridge.
* Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the &quot;Metro ExpressLanes&quot; high-occupancy toll lanes in Los Angeles County.
* Orange County Transportation Authority, co-operator of the 91 Express Lanes, as well as the operator of the I-405 high-occupancy toll lanes in Orange County.
* Riverside County Transportation Commission, co-operator of the 91 Express Lanes, as well as the operator of the &quot;Riverside Express&quot; high-occupancy toll lanes in Riverside County.
* San Bernardino County Transportation Authority (SBCTA), operator of the high-occupancy toll lanes in San Bernardino County.
* San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), operator of the toll facilities in San Diego County.
* San Francisco County Transportation Authority, operator of any future congestion pricing or other tolling facility in the City and County of San Francisco.
* San Mateo County Express Lanes Joint Powers Authority, operator of the high-occupancy toll lanes in San Mateo County.
* Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), operator of the high-occupancy toll lanes in Santa Clara County.
* Transportation Corridor Agencies, operator of the toll roads in Orange County.

===Service center operations===
All toll facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area share the same billing, customer service center, and web site. In 2018, Transportation Corridor Agencies, operator of the Orange County toll roads, signed a long term agreement to be the processing partner for the San Bernardino County high-occupancy toll lanes. All the other toll agencies in Southern California have separate billing, customer service centers, and web sites. Anybody with a FasTrak transponder can use it to pay tolls on any California toll facility using the system. Each center establishes its own fee and discount structures.

====Fees====
Each FasTrak account agency has its own monthly minimums / monthly fees (from lowest to highest)

===Tag types===

The standard FasTrak transponder tag can be used by most vehicles. Transportation Corridor Agencies (TCA) also offers a sticker transponder that has the same functionality as a standard one.

For those traveling on the HOT express lanes in the Bay Area, in Riverside County, in San Bernardino County, or the Los Angeles Metro ExpressLanes and want the carpooling discounts, they will need a switchable &quot;FasTrak Flex&quot; transponder. These devices include a switch that indicates the number of occupants (1, 2, or 3 or more) in the vehicle. This enables the open road tolling system to automatically compute the carpool or solo driver toll. The Bay Area toll bridges and the 91 Express Lanes instead have designated carpool lanes, so any tag type can be used (although both the 91 Express Lanes and TCA agencies also offer the switchable FasTrak Flex tags to its users if they want to use the Los Angeles or Riverside County express lanes too).

For eligible clean air vehicles (CAVs) registered with the California DMV, the Bay Area FasTrak center and Riverside County HOT express lanes also offer a special &quot;FasTrak CAV&quot; tag for those who qualify for those discounts on applicable toll facilities. Other toll agencies may instead offer a special account for registered clean air vehicles on their HOT express lanes.

For the I-15 Express Lanes in San Diego County, SANDAG only offers the standard FasTrak transponder, and instead instructs drivers that they can &quot;declare&quot; that they are a carpool or a registered CAV (and thus do not have to pay a toll) by removing their transponder from the windshield or covering their tag in the provided mylar bag.

Neither the Orange County toll roads operated by the TCA nor the South Bay Expressway toll road in San Diego County offer carpooling or CAV discounts.

===Retail availability===
Some agencies like the Bay Area FasTrak center, Metro ExpressLanes, and SANDAG may offer a packaged FasTrak transponder sold over-the-counter at a retail setting, such as nearby Costco locations. Customers must still register their transponders with the issuing agency.

===Security===

A 2008 teardown analysis of the Fastrak transponder and analysis of its security issues was published by Root Labs, finding that they are updated remotely and do not use encryption. Furthermore, FasTrak&#x27;s basic functionality and specifications are listed under Title 21, Division 2, Chapter 16 of the &quot;California Code of Regulations&quot;, and are thus freely accessible to the general public. FasTrak units are also used to generate 5-1-1 traffic data, using sensors and antennae placed across various freeways. In response, the Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission stated that they would contact the vendors manufacturing the FasTrak equipment and transponders to &quot;identify potential risks and corrective actions&quot;.

==History==
As the first ETC system in North America was installed on the Dallas North Tollway in 1989, many California toll facilities started to express interest in the technology. Because the state&#x27;s toll roads and bridges are run by different government agencies, there was the possibility that a number of different incompatible ETC systems would be instituted throughout California. Therefore, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill 1523 in 1990, requiring
Caltrans, the state&#x27;s Department of Transportation, to develop a statewide technical specification which all systems would be required to meet. As a result, California was the first in the nation to require all of its toll bridges and roads to use the same ETC system. This technical specification was later codified in Title 21, Division 2, Chapter 16 of the &quot;California Code of Regulations&quot;.

When the Foothill Toll Road in Orange County opened in 1993, it became the first California toll facility to use an ETC system. Transportation Corridor Agencies (TCA), the local agency in charge of the toll road, named the system &quot;FasTrak&quot;.
To this day, TCA still holds the trademark to the &quot;FasTrak&quot; name and logo.

When TCA first introduced the FasTrak system, the electronic transponders consisted of a gadget about the size of a Walkman in which a smart card was inserted.
However, the smart cards were unpopular with both tollway officials and users because they cost more, offered little advantage, and customers were charged with a $10 annual fee (which has since been discontinued).
By the time the 91 Express Lanes opened in 1995, the FasTrak transponders were redesigned to be the size of a coaster that could be mounted by Velcro strips to the windshield.

TCA later deployed the FasTrak system to the two other toll roads they administer as soon as they opened: the San Joaquin Hills Toll Road in 1996 and the Eastern Toll Road in 1998. Also in 1998, the system was then deployed on the high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along Interstate 15 in San Diego.
However, the system had to be modified so that it could be used on California&#x27;s toll bridges. After a test run on the Carquinez Bridge in 1996, it had accuracy problems in dealing with the 18 different toll classifications for different kinds of trucks.
After the changes were made and another test run, the Carquinez Bridge became the first California toll bridge to use FasTrak in 1997. However, bureaucratic inaction, technical difficulties, and financial mismanagement delayed the deployment of the system to the other six state-run toll bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area until October 2000. Meanwhile, the Golden Gate Bridge, run by the independent Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, installed their system a few months earlier in July of that year. The FasTrak system was also briefly used on the state-owned San Diego-Coronado Bridge until tolls were discontinued on that structure in 2002. The Bay Area FasTrak Customer Center then opened in 2005, merging the service center for the state&#x27;s Bay Area bridges with the one that was being operated separately by the Golden Gate Bridge District.

Since then, several other new toll facilities around California have either opened, are under construction, or are in the planning stages. They are all required to accept FasTrak as per the aforementioned state law.

In 2009, San Francisco International Airport began accepting FasTrak in all of its parking garages, including long-term parking. Currently only FasTrak accounts opened from either the Bay Area FasTrak Customer Center or from Transportation Corridor Agencies can be used at the airport.

When the Metro ExpressLanes opened in Los Angeles in late 2012, it introduced FasTrak transponders with a special switch that indicates the number of occupants (1, 2, or 3 or more) in the vehicle. This enables the open road tolling system to automatically compute the carpool or solo driver toll, as well as allow the California Highway Patrol to visually check to see if there are more or fewer people in the car than indicated on the transponder. For the convenience of their FasTrak customers in the Greater Los Angeles urban area who may also use the Metro ExpressLanes, TCA began offering switchable transponders in 2013, and the 91 Express Lanes followed suit by 2015. With the switchable transponders, the violation rate on the Metro ExpressLanes fell to 10 percent from the 20 to 25 percent cheating rate in toll lanes that do not require transponders for carpoolers, prompting Alameda County officials to include the system on the then-planned I-580 Express Lanes. The Bay Area FasTrak Customer Center then started to offer switchable transponders, under the name &quot;FasTrak Flex&quot;, in summer 2015. For the HOT lanes in San Diego, drivers can &quot;declare&quot; that they are a carpool (and thus do not have to pay a toll) by covering their FasTrak transponder in a mylar bag.

There has been a push to strictly use open road tolling, accepting only payments via a FasTrak transponder, a toll-by-plate account, or one-time payments via online or by phone instead of cash. All of California&#x27;s HOT lanes only use open road tolling. The Golden Gate Bridge began requiring electronic payments for all tolls in March 2013, and all the Orange County toll roads run by TCA likewise did the same in May 2014. A plan to also eliminate toll takers on all seven of the state-owned bridges was approved in 2019. On March 20, 2020, at midnight, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all-electronic tolling was temporarily placed in effect for those seven state-owned toll bridges, and since 2021, all of them are now permanently cashless. The only toll facility that still accepts cash is the South Bay Expressway in San Diego County, but it uses unstaffed toll booths with cash machines that require exact change.

Under MAP-21, passed by the Federal government in 2012, all ETC facilities in the United States must reach some form of interoperability by October 1, 2016. In response, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 493 in 2013, authorizing Caltrans and the state&#x27;s various toll agencies to help develop compatible systems. However, the deadline, which had neither penalty nor funding attached, was not met. California regulators later approved a phase-in of transponder technology using the ISO/IEC 18000-63 (6C) standard, released in 2004, which began in 2018 and is expected to end in 2024. This would allow compatibility with systems used in nearby states of Washington, Colorado, and Utah; and also Kentucky, Indiana, Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana, plus NationalPass.

In 2019, TCA introduced a sticker transponder to replace the former plastic transponder. The sticker transponder is similar to the eGo Plus toll sticker introduced by TxTag in 2005, SunPass Mini toll sticker introduced by SunPass in 2008, and the sticker tag introduced by MnPASS in 2015.

==Toll facilities using FasTrak==
===Current===
All eight toll bridges only collect tolls in one direction. All other toll facilities collect tolls in either direction, though some express lanes exist in only one direction of their freeway in parts or the whole of their length.

&quot;^&quot; indicates that carpools require the switchable &quot;FasTrak Flex&quot; transponder.
&quot;HOV 2+&quot; indicates that carpools require two or more persons.
&quot;HOV 3+&quot; indicates that carpools require three or more persons.
&quot;†&quot; indicates that two-person carpools are tolled differently than solo drivers or carpools with three or more, typically at a rate intermediate between the solo and 3+ rates

<doc id="577301" wikidata="Q2091629" url="?curid=577301" title="Magnitude (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, the magnitude or size of a mathematical object is a property which determines whether the object is larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind. More formally, an object&#x27;s magnitude is the displayed result of an ordering (or ranking) of the class of objects to which it belongs. Magnitude as a concept dates to Ancient Greece and has been applied as a measure of distance from one object to another. For numbers, the absolute value of a number is commonly applied as the measure of units between a number and zero.

In vector spaces, the Euclidean norm is a measure of magnitude used to define a distance between two points in space. In physics, magnitude can be defined as quantity or distance. An order of magnitude is typically defined as a unit of distance between one number and another&#x27;s numerical places on the decimal scale.

== History ==
Ancient Greeks distinguished between several types of magnitude, including:
* Positive fractions
* Line segments (ordered by length)
* Plane figures (ordered by area)
* Solids (ordered by volume)
* Angles (ordered by angular magnitude)

They proved that the first two could not be the same, or even isomorphic systems of magnitude. They did not consider negative magnitudes to be meaningful, and &quot;magnitude&quot; is still primarily used in contexts in which zero is either the smallest size or less than all possible sizes.

== Numbers ==
The magnitude of any number formula_1 is usually called its &quot;absolute value&quot; or &quot;modulus&quot;, denoted by formula_2.

=== Real numbers ===
The absolute value of a real number &quot;r&quot; is defined by:
: formula_3
: formula_4

Absolute value may also be thought of as the number&#x27;s distance from zero on the real number line. For example, the absolute value of both 70 and −70 is 70.

=== Complex numbers ===
A complex number &quot;z&quot; may be viewed as the position of a point &quot;P&quot; in a 2-dimensional space, called the complex plane. The absolute value (or &quot;modulus&quot;) of &quot;z&quot; may be thought of as the distance of &quot;P&quot; from the origin of that space. The formula for the absolute value of is similar to that for the Euclidean norm of a vector in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space:
: formula_5
where the real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the real part and the imaginary part of &quot;z&quot;, respectively. For instance, the modulus of is formula_6. Alternatively, the magnitude of a complex number &quot;z&quot; may be defined as the square root of the product of itself and its complex conjugate, formula_7, where for any complex number formula_8, its complex conjugate is formula_9. 
:formula_10
(where formula_11).

== Vector spaces ==
=== Euclidean vector space ===

A Euclidean vector represents the position of a point &quot;P&quot; in a Euclidean space. Geometrically, it can be described as an arrow from the origin of the space (vector tail) to that point (vector tip). Mathematically, a vector x in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space can be defined as an ordered list of &quot;n&quot; real numbers (the Cartesian coordinates of &quot;P&quot;): &quot;x&quot; = [&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;]. Its magnitude or length, denoted by formula_12, is most commonly defined as its Euclidean norm (or Euclidean length):
: formula_13
For instance, in a 3-dimensional space, the magnitude of [3, 4, 12] is 13 because formula_14
This is equivalent to the square root of the dot product of the vector with itself:
: formula_15

The Euclidean norm of a vector is just a special case of Euclidean distance: the distance between its tail and its tip. Two similar notations are used for the Euclidean norm of a vector &quot;x&quot;:
# formula_16
# formula_17
A disadvantage of the second notation is that it can also be used to denote the absolute value of scalars and the determinants of matrices, which introduces an element of ambiguity.

=== Normed vector spaces ===
By definition, all Euclidean vectors have a magnitude (see above). However, a vector in an abstract vector space does not possess a magnitude.

A vector space endowed with a norm, such as the Euclidean space, is called a normed vector space. The norm of a vector &quot;v&quot; in a normed vector space can be considered to be the magnitude of &quot;v&quot;.

=== Pseudo-Euclidean space ===
In a pseudo-Euclidean space, the magnitude of a vector is the value of the quadratic form for that vector.

== Logarithmic magnitudes ==
When comparing magnitudes, a logarithmic scale is often used. Examples include the loudness of a sound (measured in decibels), the brightness of a star, and the Richter scale of earthquake intensity. Logarithmic magnitudes can be negative. In the natural sciences, a logarithmic magnitude is typically referred to as a &quot;level&quot;.

== Order of magnitude ==
Orders of magnitude denote differences in numeric quantities, usually measurements, by a factor of 10—that is, a difference of one digit in the location of the decimal point.

== Other mathematical measures ==
== See also ==
* Number sense
* Vector notation
* Set size

<text>Cruelty and the Beast is the third studio album by English extreme metal band Cradle of Filth, released on 5 May 1998 by Music for Nations. It is a concept album based on the legend of the Hungarian &quot;blood countess&quot; Elizabeth Báthory and features guest narration by actress Ingrid Pitt in-character as Báthory, a role she first played in the Hammer Horror film &quot;Countess Dracula&quot; in 1971.

The album, while positively received, was noted for its poor production by fans, critics and members of the band alike. A remixed and remastered edition, titled &quot;Cruelty and the Beast – Re-Mistressed&quot;, was released in November 2019.

== Recording and production ==
This was the last Cradle of Filth album to feature guitarist and songwriter Stuart Anstis and drummer Nick Barker, the first to feature guitarist Gian Pyres and the only full-length album to feature keyboardist Lecter

The production and mixing for &quot;Cruelty and the Beast&quot; has attracted some criticism, particularly for the sound quality of the drumming. Sarah Jezebel Deva revealed on the band&#x27;s official messageboards: &quot;[The production is] absolute rubbish. I remember when I first heard it – Dani played it – I walked out with tears in my eyes. I had spent twenty-five hours working in the studio on that album and it sounded like I had my head in a toilet [...] most of my vocals you couldn&#x27;t hear.&quot; After walking out of the room after Dani played it to her, she claimed to have bumped into drummer Nick Barker, who also expressed his dissatisfaction. In an interview with Scars and Guitars in 2020, Barker stated he cried when he heard the mix and demanded that the album release be postponed. Barker also stated that the main songwriters, Stuart Anstis, Les Smith and himself wanted either Andy Sneap or Peter Tagtgren to record the album and were overridden by the label.

== Release ==
Released on 5 May 1998 by record label Music for Nations, &quot;Cruelty and the Beast&quot; reached number 48 in the UK Albums Chart.

The album was reissued in a two-disc Special Edition by Koch in 2001 and by The End in 2012.

A completely remixed and remastered re-release of the album was planned for its 20th anniversary in late 2018. Producer Scott Atkins confirmed on his Instagram page on 9 October 2018 that the remix had been completed:
&quot;Vinyl test pressings have arrived and all the mixes sent off. It’s been an endeavour. Lots of restoration work needed to be done, noise reduction, hum and hiss, crosstalk and bleed. No additional recording has taken place, myself and Dani wanted it faithful to the original just sonically better. The songs are really killer and finally have some real weight to them, which the original sorely lacked.&quot; The following May, however, Atkins updated that unspecified &quot;legal issues&quot; continued to delay the release. With these issues apparently ironed out, a November 2019 release date for the newly titled &quot;Cruelty and the Beast: Remistressed&quot; was announced in late August 2019.

== Reception ==
The album ranked tenth in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s list of the top ten &quot;essential black metal&quot; albums in 2000.

<doc id="577303" wikidata="Q1261504" url="?curid=577303" title="Lizard buzzard">
<text>The lizard buzzard (Kaupifalco monogrammicus), or lizard hawk, is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is the only species placed in the genus Kaupifalco. It is native to Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its name, it may be more closely related to the &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks than the &quot;Buteo&quot; buzzards.

==Taxonomy==
Molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that the lizard buzzard is not closely related to &quot;Buteo&quot; buzzards but rather to &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks. This extends to morphological associations, e.g. the lizard buzzard has pointed and fairly short wings. Despite the lizard buzzard inhabiting Africa, phylogenetic evidence indicates that its closest relatives are the two &quot;Microspizias&quot; hawks of Central and South America.&quot;&quot;

==Description==
The lizard buzzard is a smallish stocky raptor with a total body length of 35–37 cm and a wingspan of about 79 cm. Males weigh 246 g, females 304 g on average. The upperparts, head and breast are grey. There is a vertical black line on the white throat, which distinguishes this species from all other raptors. The belly is white with fine dark barring. The underwings are white with dark tips. The tail is black with a white tip and a single white band. The eyes are dark reddish brown to black. The cere and legs are red to orange red. Sexes are similar. The flight pattern is undulating like a thrush. The juvenile lizard buzzard resembles the adult, the only variations are slight brown tinge to the wings with an orange yellow cere and legs.
==Distribution and habitat==
The lizard buzzard occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa from Eritrea to north eastern South Africa. It remains common in West Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and north eastern areas of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. Its preferred habitat is moist dense savannah woodland especially miombo woodland, forest edges and wooded margins of rivers. It is also found, especially in winter, in arid thornbush in savannah areas of East and Central Africa.

==Ecology==
Lizard buzzards are solitary and silent raptors, except for early in breeding season (September and October) when they produce a clear, distinct and melodious whistle &quot;klu-klu-klu&quot;. They remain locally resident and are dominant over intruders. There is very limited soaring flight, which only occurs during courtship displays or on rare non-breeding occasions in the late morning.

Lizzard buzzards hunt from perches, 6–10 m in height, and catch prey by swooping or gliding onto prey in the grass. They have a low attack rate, passively searching for prey which is energetically inexpensive but time-consuming. They rarely catch prey in flight. They have shorter pointed wings (ratio of wing length to body height 0.76) resulting in a more rapid flight in forests which suggests an adaptation to prey capture in dense vegetation. Their diet consists of invertebrates, reptiles and mammals. By number most common prey are grasshoppers and termites, while by biomass rodents are the most frequent. Reptiles favoured are lizards especially &quot;Mabuya&quot; and &quot;Agama&quot; lizards, frogs and snakes.

===Breeding===
Breeding occurs during the months of September to November. Lizard buzzards are monogamous and form pair bonds that are protected or permanent. Both sexes are involved in nest building which is small and compact, composed of sticks and found in the sub canopy of trees both indigenous and alien, often near the main trunk of the tree. The stick nest is lined with dry grass, green leaves or lichen.

Like other some other raptors, lizard buzzards are alternative nest users. Although they prefer to build nests in the subcanopy, when they occupy an existing nest this can occur in the canopy above. Lizard buzzards will also compete with Shikras for available nests, since these have a similar size, habitat preference and distribution.

The clutch size is 1-3 white eggs which is incubated by the female and takes 32–34 days before hatching. During this time the male feeds the female and both feed the chicks for the next 40 days. Full independence of the chicks occurs at about 90 days.

==Conservation==

The range of lizard buzzards is extremely large and does not approach the threshold for vulnerable under range distribution. The population trend appears to be stable and does not approach thresholds for vulnerable. The population size is extremely large and for these reasons is evaluated as least concern. However, in Africa particularly West and Southern Africa there have been recorded dramatic declines in some raptors. The reasons for raptor decline in Africa are rapid human population growth driving overexploitation of the land causing biodiversity loss and a decreased species richness. The raptor population declines in West Africa have been linked to loss of woodland and nest sites, increased pesticide use, intensive cultivation especially cotton and disturbance of nests. In Southern Africa raptor decline has been linked to use of poisons, powerline electrocutions, habitat destruction and raptor drowning in farm reservoirs. Despite high human population and activity in Africa, not all raptor species have declined sharply. Some raptors, especially opportunistic generalists and migrants have increased. In West Africa the grasshopper buzzard, black kite and hooded vulture have increased in number and range. Similarly in the Western Cape of South Africa, the steppe buzzard, lesser kestrel and yellow-billed kite have increased range and number. Currently there is insufficient data on the Lizard Buzzard to determine its adaptation to human land usage. It is unclear how it has adapted to loss of Woodland its preferred habitat and nesting site. Its preferred prey insects, lizards and rodents remain common in most human altered landscapes which could account for its current survival.

<text>A tunnel boring machine (TBM), also known as a &quot;mole&quot; or a &quot;worm&quot;, is a machine used to excavate tunnels. Tunnels are excavated through hard rock, wet or dry soil, or sand, each of which requires specialized technology.

Tunnel boring machines are an alternative to drilling and blasting (D&amp;B) methods and &quot;hand mining&quot;.

TBMs limit the disturbance to the surrounding ground and produce a smooth tunnel wall. This reduces the cost of lining the tunnel, and is suitable for use in urban areas. TBMs are expensive to construct, and larger ones are challenging to transport. These fixed costs become less significant for longer tunnels.

TBM-bored tunnel cross-sections range from to date. Narrower tunnels are typically bored using trenchless construction methods or horizontal directional drilling rather than TBMs. TBM tunnels are typically circular in cross-section although they may be u-shaped, horseshoes, square or rectangular.

Tunneling speeds increase over time. The first TBM peaked at 4 meters per week. This increased to 16 meters per week four decades later. By the end of the 19th century, speeds had reached over 30 meters per week. 21st century rock TBMs can excavate over 700 meters per week, while soil tunneling machines can exceed 200 meters per week. Speed generally declines as tunnel size increases.

== History ==


=== 1800s ===
The first successful tunnelling shield was developed by Sir Marc Isambard Brunel to excavate the Thames Tunnel in 1825. However, this was only the invention of the shield concept and did not involve the construction of a complete tunnel boring machine, the digging still having to be accomplished by the then standard excavation methods.

The first boring machine reported to have been built was Henri Maus&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Slicer&quot;. Commissioned by the King of Sardinia in 1845 to dig the Fréjus Rail Tunnel between France and Italy through the Alps, Maus had it built in 1846 in an arms factory near Turin. It consisted of more than 100 percussion drills mounted in the front of a locomotive-sized machine, mechanically power-driven from the entrance of the tunnel. The Revolutions of 1848 affected the funding, and the tunnel was not completed until 10 years later, by using less innovative and less expensive methods such as pneumatic drills.

In the United States, the first boring machine to have been built was used in 1853 during the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel in northwest Massachusetts. Made of cast iron, it was known as &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Patented Stone-Cutting Machine&quot;, after inventor Charles Wilson. It drilled into the rock before breaking down (the tunnel was eventually completed more than 20 years later, and as with the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, by using less ambitious methods). Wilson&#x27;s machine anticipated modern TBMs in the sense that it employed cutting discs, like those of a disc harrow, which were attached to the rotating head of the machine. In contrast to traditional chiseling or drilling and blasting, this innovative method of removing rock relied on simple metal wheels to apply a transient high pressure that fractured the rock.

In 1853, the American Ebenezer Talbot also patented a TBM that employed Wilson&#x27;s cutting discs, although they were mounted on rotating arms, which in turn were mounted on a rotating plate. In the 1870s, John D. Brunton of England built a machine employing cutting discs that were mounted eccentrically on rotating plates, which in turn were mounted eccentrically on a rotating plate, so that the cutting discs would travel over almost all of the rock face that was to be removed.

The first TBM that tunneled a substantial distance was invented in 1863 and improved in 1875 by British Army officer Major Frederick Edward Blackett Beaumont (1833–1895); Beaumont&#x27;s machine was further improved in 1880 by British Army officer Major Thomas English (1843–1935). In 1875, the French National Assembly approved the construction of a tunnel under the English Channel and the British Parliament supported a trial run using English&#x27;s TBM. Its cutting head consisted of a conical drill bit behind which were a pair of opposing arms on which were mounted cutting discs. From June 1882 to March 1883, the machine tunneled, through chalk, a total of 1,840 m (6,036 ft). A French engineer, Alexandre Lavalley, who was also a Suez Canal contractor, used a similar machine to drill 1,669 m (5,476 ft) from Sangatte on the French side. However, despite this success, the cross-Channel tunnel project was abandoned in 1883 after the British military raised fears that the tunnel might be used as an invasion route. Nevertheless, in 1883, this TBM was used to bore a railway ventilation tunnel — in diameter and long — between Birkenhead and Liverpool, England, through sandstone under the Mersey River.

The Hudson River Tunnel was constructed from 1889 to 1904 using a Greathead shield TBM. The project used air compressed to to reduce cave-ins. However, many workers died via cave-in or decompression sickness.

=== 1900s ===
During the late 19th and early 20th century, inventors continued to design, build, and test TBMs for tunnels for railroads, subways, sewers, water supplies, etc. TBMs employing rotating arrays of drills or hammers were patented. TBMs that resembled giant hole saws were proposed. Other TBMs consisted of a rotating drum with metal tines on its outer surface, or a rotating circular plate covered with teeth, or revolving belts covered with metal teeth. However, these TBMs proved expensive, cumbersome, and unable to excavate hard rock; interest in TBMs therefore declined. Nevertheless, TBM development continued in potash and coal mines, where the rock was softer.

A TBM with a bore diameter of was manufactured by The Robbins Company for Canada&#x27;s Niagara Tunnel Project. The machine was used to bore a hydroelectric tunnel beneath Niagara Falls. The machine was named &quot;Big Becky&quot; in reference to the Sir Adam Beck hydroelectric dams to which it tunnelled to provide an additional hydroelectric tunnel.

=== 2000s ===

An earth pressure balance TBM known as Bertha with a bore diameter of was produced by Hitachi Zosen Corporation in 2013. It was delivered to Seattle, Washington, for its Highway 99 tunnel project. The machine began operating in July 2013, but stalled in December 2013 and required substantial repairs that halted the machine until January 2016. Bertha completed boring the tunnel on April 4, 2017.

Two TBMs supplied by CREG excavated two tunnels for Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s Rapid Transit with a boring diameter of . The medium was water saturated sandy mudstone, schistose mudstone, highly weathered mudstone as well as alluvium. It achieved a maximum advance rate of more than per month.The world&#x27;s largest &quot;hard rock&quot; TBM, known as Martina, was built by Herrenknecht AG. Its excavation diameter was , total length ; excavation area of , thrust value 39,485 t, total weight 4,500 tons, total installed capacity 18 MW. Its yearly energy consumption was about 62 GWh. It is owned and operated by the Italian construction company Toto S.p.A. Costruzioni Generali (Toto Group) for the Sparvo gallery of the Italian Motorway Pass A1 (&quot;Variante di Valico A1&quot;), near Florence. The same company built the world&#x27;s largest-diameter slurry TBM, excavation diameter of , owned and operated by the French construction company Dragages Hong Kong (Bouygues&#x27; subsidiary) for the Tuen Mun Chek Lap Kok link in Hong Kong.

== Types==
TBMs typically consist of a rotating cutting wheel in front, called a cutter head, followed by a main bearing, a thrust system, a system to remove excavated material (muck), and support mechanisms. Machines vary with site geology, amount of ground water present, and other factors.

Rock boring machines differ from earth boring machines in the way they cut the tunnel, the way they provide traction to support the boring activity, and in the way they support the newly formed tunnels walls.

=== Tunnel wall types ===

==== Concrete lining ====

Shielded TBMs are typically used to excavate tunnels in soil. They erect concrete segments behind the TBM to support the tunnel walls.

The machine stabilizes itself in the tunnel with hydraulic cylinders that press against the shield, allowing the TBM to apply pressure at the tunnel face.

==== Main Beam ====
Main Beam machines do not install concrete segments behind the cutter head. Instead, the rock is held up using ground support methods such as ring beams, rock bolts, shotcrete, steel straps, ring steel and wire mesh.

=== Shield types ===

Depending on the stability of the local geology, the newly formed walls of the tunnel often need to be supported immediately after being dug to avoid collapse, before any permanent support or lining has been constructed. Many TBMs are equipped with one or more cylindrical shields following behind the cutter head to support the walls until permanent tunnel support is constructed further along the machine. The stability of the walls also influences the method by which the TBM anchors itself in place so that it can apply force to the cutting head. This in turn determines whether the machine can bore and advance simultaneously, or whether these are done in alternating modes.

==== Open/Gripper ====
Gripper TBMs are used in rock tunnels. They forgo the use of a shield and instead push directly against the unreinforced sides of the tunnel.

Machines such as a Wirth machine can be moved only while ungripped. Other machines can move continuously. At the end of a Wirth boring cycle, legs drop to the ground, the grippers are retracted, and the machine advances. The grippers then reengage and the rear legs lift for the next cycle.

==== Single shield ====

A single-shield TBM has a single cylindrical shield after the cutting head. A permanent concrete lining is constructed immediately after the shield, and the TBM pushes off the lining to apply force to the cutter head. Because this pushing cannot be done while a next ring of lining is being constructed, the single-shield TBM operates in alternating cutting and lining modes.

==== Double shield ====

Double Shield (or telescopic shield) TBMs have a leading shield that advances with the cutting head and a trailing shield that acts as a gripper. The two shields can move axially relative to each other (i.e., telescopically) over a limited distance. The gripper shield anchors the TBM so that pressure can be applied to the cutter head while simultaneously the concrete lining is being constructed.

=== Tunnel-face support methods ===

In hard rock with minimal ground water, the area around the cutter head of a TBM can be unpressurized, as the exposed rock face can support itself. In weaker soil, or when there is significant ground water, pressure must be applied to the face of the tunnel to prevent collapse and/or the infiltration of ground water into the machine.

==== Earth Pressure Balance ====


Earth pressure balance (EPB) machines are used in soft ground with less than of pressure. It uses muck to maintain pressure at the tunnel face. The muck (or spoil) is admitted into the TBM via a screw conveyor. By adjusting the rate of extraction of muck and the advance rate of the TBM, the pressure at the face of the TBM can be controlled without the use of slurry. Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to stabilize the ground. Such additives can separately be injected in the cutter head and extraction screw to ensure that the muck is sufficiently cohesive to maintain pressure and restrict water flow.

Like some other TBM types, EPB&#x27;s use thrust cylinders to advance by pushing against concrete segments. The cutter head uses a combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide disc cutters, drag picks and/or hard rock disc cutters.

EPB has allowed soft, wet, or unstable ground to be tunneled with a speed and safety not previously possible. The Channel Tunnel, the Thames Water Ring Main, sections of the London Underground, and most new metro tunnels completed in the last 20 years worldwide were excavated using this method. EPB has historically competed with the slurry shield method (see below), where the slurry is used to stabilize the tunnel face and transport spoil to the surface. EPB TBMs are mostly used in finer ground (such as clay) while slurry TBMs are mostly used for coarser ground (such as gravel).

==== Slurry shield ====

Slurry shield machines can be used in soft ground with high water pressure or where granular ground conditions (sands and gravels) do not allow a plug to form in the screw. The cutter head is filled with pressurised slurry, typically made of bentonite clay that applies hydrostatic pressure to the face. The slurry mixes with the muck before it is pumped to a slurry separation plant, usually outside the tunnel.

Slurry separation plants use multi-stage filtration systems that separate spoil from slurry to allow reuse. The degree to which slurry can be &#x27;cleaned&#x27; depends on the relative particle sizes of the muck. Slurry TBMs are not suitable for silts and clays as the particle sizes of the spoil are less than that of the bentonite. In this case, water is removed from the slurry leaving a clay cake, which may be polluted.

A caisson system is sometimes placed at the cutting head to allow workers to operate the machine, although air pressure may reach elevated levels in the caisson, requiring workers to be medically cleared as &quot;fit to dive&quot; and able to operate pressure locks.

==== Open face soft ground ====
Open face soft ground TBMs rely on the excavated ground to briefly stand without support. They are suitable for use in ground with a strength of up to about with low water inflows. They can bore tunnels with cross-section in excess of . A backactor arm or cutter head bore to within of the edge of the shield. After a boring cycle, the shield is jacked forward to begin a new cycle. Ground support is provided by precast concrete, or occasionally spheroidal graphite iron (SGI) segments that are bolted or supported until a support ring has been added. The final segment, called the key, is wedge-shaped, and expands the ring until it is tight against the ground.

=== Tunnel size ===

TBMs range diameter from . Micro tunnel shield TBMs are used to construct small tunnels, and is a smaller equivalent to a general tunnelling shield and generally bore tunnels of , too small for operators to walk in.

==Backup systems==
Behind all types of tunnel boring machines, in the finished part of the tunnel, are trailing support decks known as the backup system, whose mechanisms can include conveyors or other systems for muck removal; slurry pipelines (if applicable); control rooms; electrical, dust-removal and ventilation systems; and mechanisms for transport of pre-cast segments.

== Urban tunnelling and near-surface tunnelling ==

Urban tunnelling has the special requirement that the surface remain undisturbed, and that ground subsidence be avoided. The normal method of doing this in soft ground is to maintain soil pressures during and after construction.

TBMs with positive face control, such as earth pressure balance (EPB) and slurry shield (SS), are used in such situations. Both types (EPB and SS) are capable of reducing the risk of surface subsidence and voids if ground conditions are well documented. When tunnelling in urban environments, other tunnels, existing utility lines and deep foundations must be considered, and the project must accommodate measures to mitigate any detrimental effects to other infrastructure.

<text>The UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism is a graduate professional school on the campus of University of California, Berkeley. It is designed to produce journalists with a two-year Master of Journalism (MJ) degree. It also offers a summer minor in journalism to undergraduates and a journalism certificate option to non–UC Berkeley students.

The school is located in North Gate Hall on the central campus of UC Berkeley. It is being served by dean Geeta Anand, who replaced Edward Wasserman on July 1, 2020 as an interim dean, and then was formally appointed as permanent dean on Oct 21, 2020. Wasserman voluntarily stepped down six months before his expected departure in response to criticism by students about the lack of diversity in the administration.

Most courses offered by the school are on the graduate level, with a summer-only minor offered to undergraduates. The school enrolls approximately 120 students; 60 first-year and 60-second-year students, and is among the smaller graduate schools on the campus of UC Berkeley.

==Curriculum==
The UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism focuses on six media platforms of journalism: Audio journalism, documentary film, narrative writing, multimedia, photojournalism, and video journalism. It is further separated into four reporting interests: health, international, investigative, and science and technology.

The school&#x27;s focus is on professional practice rather than research, and requires students to perform an internship at a media outlet as a degree requirement between their first and second year of study.

Students are also required to take an introductory news reporting course called J200, where they publish in one of two hyperlocal news websites that are run by the school: Oakland North and Richmond Confidential.

== Permanent faculty ==
*Geeta Anand, dean, professor of reporting and former Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign correspondent for the New York Times
*David Barstow, Reva and David Logan Distinguished Professor in Investigative Reporting and four-time New York Times Pulitzer Prize winner.
*Elena Conis, professor and former Mellon Fellow in Health and Humanities at Emory University
*Mark Danner, professor and New Yorker writer, author
*Bill Drummond, professor and NPR Morning Edition founding editor
*Richard Koci Hernandez, associate professor and former multimedia journalist at the San Jose Mercury News.
*Ken Light, Reva and David Logan Professor of Photojournalism.
*Michael Pollan, John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science and Environmental Journalism, notable author on food topics
*Jeremy Rue, associate dean and associate adjunct professor of Computational Journalism.
*Edward Wasserman, professor; former professor at Washington and Lee University

==In the news==

In 2015, the estate of photographer Jim Marshall created the Jim Marshall Fellowships in Photography at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism&#x27;s Center for Photography.

China expert and author Orville Schell served as dean of the school from 1996 to the summer of 2007. Before Schell, Thomas Goldstein served as dean from 1988 until he left to become the dean of Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism. He stepped down from that position after five years, despite being credited for increasing endowments for that school from $54 million to $84 million over his short stint there. He is currently teaching a news writing class at UC Berkeley&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism. Pulitzer Prize-winning American media critic Ben Bagdikian also served as a past dean of the UC Berkeley&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism.

In 1981, actress Carol Burnett won a $1.6 million (later reduced to $800,000) libel award from &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; over an article that she said implied she had been intoxicated in a Washington restaurant. She donated a portion of that to the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism saying she hoped the suit would teach aspiring journalists the dangers of defaming individuals in articles. The money was used to fund law and ethics courses.

==North Gate Hall==
The UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism is housed in North Gate Hall, a designated National Historic Landmark in the National Register of Historic Places. It is located immediately southeast of the intersection of Euclid and Hearst avenues in Berkeley, Calif., on the campus of UC Berkeley.

The name is derived from the general area in front of the school called &quot;North Gate,&quot; represented by two stone pillars. It serves as the northernmost entrance of the primary University compound, and is opposite to Sather Gate, the southernmost entrance of the University.

North Gate Hall was built in 1904 as a building known at the time as the &quot;Ark&quot; to house the architectural department. The building cost $4,394.59 to construct and consisted of an atelier, office for John Galen Howard and an architectural library with volumes donated by Phoebe Apperson Hearst – mother to William Randolph Hearst.

The building was one of many on campus which did not follow the typical Beaux-Arts architectural style, which had been regarded the most cultured, beautiful and &quot;scientific&quot; style of the cultural establishment at the time. Instead, the building was made only to be temporary, non-academic, or not particularly &quot;serious.&quot; Other such buildings in the shingle or &quot;Collegiate Gothic&quot; style on campus include: North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, Stephens Hall and the Men&#x27;s Faculty Club.

A second addition to the Ark was completed in 1908, increasing the size of the building to . The new addition was built further up the hill (easterly) and houses what is known today as the Greenhouse and upper and lower newsrooms.

In 1936, Walter Steilberg designed a library wing composed of reinforced concrete-panel, a stark contrast to the dark shingled appearance of the original building.

In 1957, the architecture school was united with the departments of Landscape Architecture, City and regional Planning, and Decorative Arts to form the College of Environmental Design. The &quot;Ark&quot; was relocated to Wurster Hall in 1964, and the building was renamed the Engineering Research Services Building. It later was renamed &quot;North Gate Hall,&quot; and served as the location for the Graduate School of Journalism.

North Gate Hall was occupied by the journalism school in 1981.

In 1993 the building underwent extensive seismic renovations causing uproar from Berkeley preservationists who had saved the building from destruction 17 years earlier. It was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle that dry rot had set into much of the building. Damage from aging was so bad, one teacher said he could puncture a supporting column with his fountain pen. It was classified as Berkeley campus&#x27; most vulnerable buildings in an earthquake.

<text> is a command-line utility on a number of computer operating systems including Unix, Plan 9, Inferno and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux that prints an ASCII calendar of the given month or year. If the user does not specify any command-line options, codice_1 will print a calendar of the current month. The command is a standard program on Unix and specified in the Single UNIX Specification.

==Implementations==
The codice_1 command was present in 1st Edition Unix. A codice_1 command is also part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2. It is also available for FreeDOS. This implementation only supports the Gregorian calendar (New Style) and may be distributed freely, with or without source. The FreeDOS version was developed by Charles Dye.

The Gregorian calendar reform was adopted by the Kingdom of Great Britain, including its possessions in North America (later to become eastern USA and Canada), in September 1752. As a result, the September 1752 cal shows the adjusted days missing. This month was the official (British) adoption of the Gregorian calendar from the previously used Julian calendar. This has been documented in the man pages for Sun Solaris as follows. &quot;An unusual calendar is printed for September 1752. That is the month when 11 days were skipped to make up for lack of leap year adjustments.&quot; The Plan 9 from Bell Labs manual states: &quot;Try .&quot; Date of adoption of the reform differs widely between countries so, for some users, this feature may be a bug. Special handling of 1752 is known to have appeared as early as the first edition of the &quot;Unix Programmer&#x27;s Manual&quot; in 1971.

<doc id="577320" wikidata="Q844244" url="?curid=577320" title="Language revitalization">
<text>Language revitalization, also referred to as language revival or reversing language shift, is an attempt to halt or reverse the decline of a language or to revive an extinct one. Those involved can include linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments. Some argue for a distinction between language revival (the resurrection of an extinct language with no existing native speakers) and language revitalization (the rescue of a &quot;dying&quot; language). There has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival: that of the Hebrew language.

Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is severely limited. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive extinct languages. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or language death.

Reasons for revitalization vary: they can include physical danger affecting those whose language is dying, economic danger such as the exploitation of indigenous natural resources, political danger such as genocide, or cultural danger/assimilation. In recent times alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers; and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct. These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique &quot;cultural treasure.&quot; A community often sees language as a unique part of its culture, connecting it with its ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of its history and self-image.

Language revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of language documentation. In this field, linguists try to create a complete record of a language&#x27;s grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.

== Degrees of language endangerment ==
=== UNESCO&#x27;s Language Vitality and Endangerment Framework ===
Uses a six-point scale is as follows:
* Safe: All generations use language in variety of settings
* Stable: Multilingualism in the native language and one or more dominant language(s) has usurped certain important communication context.
* Definitively Endangered: spoken by older people; not fully used by younger generations.
* Severely Endangered: Only a few adult speakers remain; no longer used as native language by children.
* Critically Endangered: The language is spoken only by grandparents and older generations.
* Extinct: There is no one who can speak or remember the language.

=== Other scales ===
Another scale for identifying degrees of language endangerment is used in a 2003 paper (&quot;Language Vitality and Endangerment&quot;) commissioned by UNESCO from an international group of linguists. The linguists, among other goals and priorities, create a scale with six degrees for language vitality and endangerment. They also propose nine factors or criteria (six of which use the six-degree scale) to &quot;characterize a language’s overall sociolinguistic situation&quot;. The nine factors with their respective scales are:

# Intergenerational language transmission
#* safe: all generations use the language
#* unsafe: some children use the language in all settings, all children use the language in some settings
#* definitively endangered: few children speak the language; predominantly spoken by the parental generation and older
#* severely endangered: spoken by older generations; not used by the parental generation and younger
#* critically endangered: few speakers remain and are mainly from the great grandparental generation
#* extinct: no living speakers
# Absolute number of speakers
# Proportion of speakers within the total population
#* safe: the language is spoken by approximately 100% of the population
#* unsafe: the language is spoken by nearly but visibly less than 100% of the population
#* definitively endangered: the language is spoken by a majority of the population
#* severely endangered: the language is spoken by less than 50% of the population
#* critically endangered: the language has very few speakers
#* extinct: no living speakers
# Trends in existing language domains
#* universal use (safe): spoken in all domains; for all functions
#* multilingual parity (unsafe): multiple languages (2+) are spoken in most social domains; for most functions
#* dwindling domains (definitively endangered): mainly spoken in home domains and is in competition with the dominant language; for many functions
#* limited or formal domains (severely endangered): spoken in limited social domains; for several functions
#* highly limited domains (critically endangered): spoken in highly restricted domains; for minimal functions
#* extinct: no domains; no functions
# Response to new domains and media
#* dynamic (safe): spoken in all new domains
#* robust/active (unsafe): spoken in most new domains
#* receptive (definitively endangered): spoken in many new domains
#* coping (severely endangered): spoken in some new domains
#* minimal (critically endangered): spoken in minimal new domains
#* inactive (extinct): spoken in no new domains
# Materials for language education and literacy
#* safe: established orthography and extensive access to educational materials
#* unsafe: access to educational materials; children developing literacy; not used by administration
#* definitively endangered: access to educational materials exist at school; literacy in language is not promoted
#* severely endangered: literacy materials exist however are not present in school curriculum
#* critically endangered: orthography is known and some written materials exist
#* extinct: no orthography is known
# Governmental and institutional language attitudes and policies (including official status and use)
#* equal support (safe): all languages are equally protected
#* differentiated support (unsafe): primarily protected for private domains
#* passive assimilation (definitively endangered): no explicit protective policy; language use dwindles in public domain
#* active assimilation (severely endangered): government discourages use of language; no governmental protection of language in any domain
#* forced assimilation (critically endangered): language is not recognized or protected; government recognized another official language
#* prohibition (extinct): use of language is banned
# Community members&#x27; attitudes towards their own language
#* safe: language is revered, valued, and promoted by whole community
#* unsafe: language maintenance is supported by most of the community
#* definitively endangered: language maintenance is supported by much of the community; the rest are indifferent or support language loss
#* severely endangered: language maintenance is supported by some of the community; the rest are indifferent or support language loss
#* critically endangered: language maintenance is supported by only a few members of the community; the rest are indifferent or support language loss
#* extinct: complete apathy towards language maintenance; prefer dominant language
# Amount and quality of documentation.
#* superlative (safe): extensive audio, video, media, and written documentation of the language
#* good (unsafe): audio, video, media, and written documentation all exist; a handful of each
#* fair (definitively endangered): some audio and video documentation exists; adequate written documentation
#* fragmentary (severely endangered): limited audio and video documentation exists at low quality; minimal written documentation
#* inadequate (critically endangered): only a handful of written documentation exists
#* undocumented (extinct): no documentation exists

== Theory ==
One of the most important preliminary steps in language revitalization/recovering involves establishing the degree to which a particular language has been “dislocated.” This helps involved parties find the best way to assist or revive the language.

=== Steps in reversing language shift ===
There are many different theories or models that attempt to lay out a plan for language revitalization. One of these is provided by celebrated linguist Joshua Fishman.
Fishman&#x27;s model for reviving threatened (or sleeping) languages, or for making them sustainable, consists of an eight-stage process. Efforts should be concentrated on the earlier stages of restoration until they have been consolidated before proceeding to the later stages. The eight stages are:

#Acquisition of the language by adults, who in effect act as language apprentices (recommended where most of the remaining speakers of the language are elderly and socially isolated from other speakers of the language).
#Create a socially integrated population of active speakers (or users) of the language (at this stage it is usually best to concentrate mainly on the spoken language rather than the written language).
#In localities where there are a reasonable number of people habitually using the language, encourage the informal use of the language among people of all age groups and within families and bolster its daily use through the establishment of local neighbourhood institutions in which the language is encouraged, protected and (in certain contexts at least) used exclusively.
#In areas where oral competence in the language has been achieved in all age groups, encourage literacy in the language, but in a way that does not depend upon assistance from (or goodwill of) the state education system.
#Where the state permits it, and where numbers warrant, encourage the use of the language in compulsory state education.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in the workplace.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in local government services and mass media.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage use of the language in higher education, government, etc.

This model of language revival is intended to direct efforts to where they are most effective and to avoid wasting energy trying to achieve the later stages of recovery when the earlier stages have not been achieved. For instance, it is probably wasteful to campaign for the use of a language on television or in government services if hardly any families are in the habit of using the language.

Additionally, Tasaku Tsunoda describes a range of different techniques or methods that speakers can use to try to revitalize a language, including techniques to revive extinct languages and maintain weak ones. The techniques he lists are often limited to the current vitality of the language.

He claims that the immersion method cannot be used to revitalize an extinct or moribund language. In contrast, the master-apprentice method of one-on-one transmission on language proficiency can be used with moribund languages. Several other methods of revitalization, including those that rely on technology such as recordings or media, can be used for languages in any state of viability.

=== Factors in successful language revitalization ===
David Crystal, in his book &quot;Language Death&quot;, proposes that language revitalization is more likely to be successful if its speakers:
* increase the language&#x27;s prestige within the dominant community;
* increase their wealth and income;
* increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community;
* have a strong presence in the education system;
* can write down the language;
* can use electronic technology.

In her book, &quot;Endangered Languages: An Introduction,&quot; Sarah Thomason notes the success of revival efforts for modern Hebrew and the relative success of revitalizing Maori in New Zealand (see &quot;Specific Examples&quot; below). One notable factor these two examples share is that the children were raised in fully immersive environments. In the case of Hebrew, it was on early collective-communities called kibbutzim. For the Maori language In New Zealand, this was done through a language nest.

=== Revival linguistics ===
Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann proposes &quot;Revival Linguistics&quot; as a new linguistic discipline and paradigm.
According to Zuckermann, &quot;revival linguistics combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning. After all, language reclamation is the most extreme case of second-language learning. Revival linguistics complements the established area of documentary linguistics, which records endangered languages before they fall asleep.&quot;

Zuckermann proposes that &quot;revival linguistics changes the field of historical linguistics by, for instance, weakening the family tree model, which implies that a language has only one parent.&quot;

There are disagreements in the field of language revitalization as to the degree that revival should concentrate on maintaining the traditional language, versus allowing simplification or widespread borrowing from the majority language.

==== Compromise ====
Zuckermann acknowledges the presence of &quot;local peculiarities and idiosyncrasies&quot; but suggests that &quot;there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would help revivalists and first nations&#x27; leaders to work more efficiently. For example, it is easier to resurrect basic vocabulary and verbal conjugations than sounds and word order. Revivalists should be realistic and abandon discouraging, counter-productive slogans such as &quot;Give us authenticity or give us death!&quot; Nancy Dorian has pointed out that conservative attitudes toward loanwords and grammatical changes often hamper efforts to revitalize endangered languages (as with Tiwi in Australia), and that a division can exist between educated revitalizers, interested in historicity, and remaining speakers interested in locally authentic idiom (as has sometimes occurred with Irish). Some have argued that structural compromise may, in fact, enhance the prospects of survival, as may have been the case with English in the post-Norman period.

==== Traditionalist ====
Other linguists have argued that when language revitalization borrows heavily from the majority language, the result is a new language, perhaps a creole or pidgin. For example, the existence of &quot;Neo-Hawaiian&quot; as a separate language from &quot;Traditional Hawaiian&quot; has been proposed, due to the heavy influence of English on every aspect of the revived Hawaiian language. This has also been proposed for Irish, with a sharp division between &quot;Urban Irish&quot; (spoken by second-language speakers) and traditional Irish (as spoken as a first language in Gaeltacht areas). Ó Béarra stated: &quot;[to] follow the syntax and idiomatic conventions of English, [would be] producing what amounts to little more than English in Irish drag.&quot; With regard to the then-moribund Manx language, the scholar T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly stated, &quot;When a language surrenders itself to foreign idiom, and when all its speakers become bilingual, the penalty is death.&quot; Neil McRae has stated that the uses of Scottish Gaelic are becoming increasingly tokenistic, and native Gaelic idiom is being lost in favor of artificial terms created by second-language speakers.

== Specific examples ==
The total revival of a dead language (in the sense of having no native speakers) to become the shared means of communication of a self-sustaining community of several million first language speakers has happened only once, in the case of Hebrew, resulting in Modern Hebrew – now the national language of Israel. In this case, there was a unique set of historical and cultural characteristics that facilitated the revival. (See Revival of the Hebrew language.) Hebrew, once largely a liturgical language, was re-established as a means of everyday communication by Jews, some of whom had lived in what is now the State of Israel, starting in the nineteenth century. It is the world&#x27;s most famous and successful example of language revitalization.

In a related development, literary languages without native speakers enjoyed great prestige and practical utility as lingua francas, often counting millions of fluent speakers at a time. In many such cases, a decline in the use of the literary language, sometimes precipitous, was later accompanied by a strong renewal. This happened, for example, in the revival of Classical Latin in the Renaissance, and the revival of Sanskrit in the early centuries AD. An analogous phenomenon in contemporary Arabic-speaking areas is the expanded use of the literary language (Modern Standard Arabic, a form of the Classical Arabic of the 6th century AD). This is taught to all educated speakers and is used in radio broadcasts, formal discussions, etc.

In addition, literary languages have sometimes risen to the level of becoming first languages of very large language communities. An example is standard Italian, which originated as a literary language based on the language of 13th-century Florence, especially as used by such important Florentine writers as Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio. This language existed for several centuries primarily as a literary vehicle, with few native speakers; even as late as 1861, on the eve of Italian unification, the language only counted about 500,000 speakers (many non-native), out of a total population of . The subsequent success of the language has been through conscious development, where speakers of any of the numerous Italian languages were taught standard Italian as a second language and subsequently imparted it to their children, who learned it as a first language. Of course this came at the expense of local Italian languages, most of which are now endangered. Success was enjoyed in similar circumstances by High German, standard Czech, Castilian Spanish and other languages.

=== Africa ===
The Coptic language began its decline when Arabic became the predominant language in Egypt. Pope Shenouda III established the Coptic Language Institute in December 1976 in Saint Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Cairo for the purpose of reviving the Coptic language.

=== Americas ===
==== North America ====
In recent years, a growing number of Native American tribes have been trying to revitalize their languages. For example, there are apps (including phrases, word lists and dictionaries) in many Native languages including Cree, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Lakota, Ojibwe, Oneida, Massachusett, Navajo, Halq&#x27;emeylem, Gwych&#x27;in, and Lushootseed.

Wampanoag, a language spoken by the people of the same name in Massachusetts, underwent a language revival project led by Jessie Little Doe Baird, a trained linguist. Members of the tribe use the extensive written records that exist in their language, including a translation of the Bible and legal documents, in order to learn and teach Wampanoag. The project has seen children speaking the language fluently for the first time in over 100 years. In addition, there are currently attempts at reviving the Chochenyo language of California, which had become extinct.

Efforts are being made by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community and others to keep Chinook Jargon, also known as Chinuk Wawa, alive. This is helped by the corpus of songs and stories collected from Victoria Howard and published by Melville Jacobs.

The open-source platform FirstVoices hosts community-managed websites for 85 language revitalization projects, covering multiple varieties of 33 Indigenous languages in British Columbia as well as over a dozen languages from &quot;elsewhere in Canada and around the globe&quot;, along with 17 dictionary apps.

=====Tlingit=====
Similar to other indigenous languages, Tlingit is critically endangered. Fewer than 100 fluent Elders existed as of 2017. From 2013 to 2014, the language activist, author, and teacher, Sʔímlaʔxw Michele K. Johnson from the Syilx Nation, attempted to teach two hopeful learners of Tlingit in the Yukon. Her methods included textbook creation, sequenced immersion curriculum, and film assessment. The aim was to assist in the creation of adult speakers that are of parent-age, so that they too can begin teaching the language. In 2020, X̱ʼunei Lance Twitchell led a Tlingit online class with Outer Coast College. Dozens of students participated. He is an associate professor of Alaska Native Languages in the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Alaska Southeast which offers a minor in Tlingit language and an emphasis on Alaska Native Languages and Studies within a Bachelorʼs degree in Liberal Arts.

==== South America ====
Kichwa is the variety of the Quechua language spoken in Ecuador and is one of the most widely spoken indigenous languages in South America. Despite this fact, Kichwa is a threatened language, mainly because of the expansion of Spanish in South America. One community of original Kichwa speakers, Lagunas, was one of the first indigenous communities to switch to the Spanish language. According to King, this was because of the increase of trade and business with the large Spanish-speaking town nearby. The Lagunas people assert that it was not for cultural assimilation purposes, as they value their cultural identity highly. However, once this contact was made, language for the Lagunas people shifted through generations, to Kichwa and Spanish bilingualism and now is essentially Spanish monolingualism. The feelings of the Lagunas people present a dichotomy with language use, as most of the Lagunas members speak Spanish exclusively and only know a few words in Kichwa.

The prospects for Kichwa language revitalization are not promising, as parents depend on schooling for this purpose, which is not nearly as effective as continual language exposure in the home. Schooling in the Lagunas community, although having a conscious focus on teaching Kichwa, consists of mainly passive interaction, reading, and writing in Kichwa. In addition to grassroots efforts, national language revitalization organizations, like CONAIE, focus attention on non-Spanish speaking indigenous children, who represent a large minority in the country. Another national initiative, Bilingual Intercultural Education Project (PEBI), was ineffective in language revitalization because instruction was given in Kichwa and Spanish was taught as a second language to children who were almost exclusively Spanish monolinguals.
Although some techniques seem ineffective, Kendall A. King provides several suggestions:

# Exposure to and acquisition of the language at a young age.
# Extreme immersion techniques.
# Multiple and diverse efforts to reach adults.
# Flexibility and coordination in planning and implementation
# Directly addressing different varieties of the language.
# Planners stressing that language revitalization is a long process
# Involving as many people as possible
# Parents using the language with their children
# Planners and advocates approaching the problem from all directions.

Specific suggestions include imparting an elevated perception of the language in schools, focusing on grassroots efforts both in school and the home, and maintaining national and regional attention.

=== Asia ===
==== Hebrew ====

The revival of the Hebrew language is
the only successful example of a revived dead language. The Hebrew language survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy and rabbinic literature. With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century, it was revived as a spoken and literary language, becoming primarily a spoken lingua franca among the early Jewish immigrants to Ottoman Palestine and received the official status in the 1922 constitution of the British Mandate for Palestine and subsequently of the State of Israel.

==== Sanskrit ====

There have been recent attempts at reviving Sanskrit in India. However, despite these attempts, there are no first language speakers of Sanskrit in India. In each of India&#x27;s recent decennial censuses, several thousand citizens have reported Sanskrit to be their mother tongue. However, these reports are thought to signify a wish to be aligned with the prestige of the language, rather than being genuinely indicative of the presence of thousands of L1 Sanskrit speakers in India. There has also been a rise of so-called &quot;Sanskrit villages&quot;, but experts have cast doubt on the extent to which Sanskrit is really spoken in such villages.

==== Soyot ====
The Soyot language of the small-numbered Soyots in Buryatia, Russia, one of the Siberian Turkic languages, has been reconstructed and a Soyot-Buryat-Russian dictionary was published in 2002. The language is currently taught in some elementary schools.

==== Ainu ====

The Ainu language of the indigenous Ainu people of northern Japan is currently moribund, but efforts are underway to revive it. A 2006 survey of the Hokkaido Ainu indicated that only 4.6% of Ainu surveyed were able to converse in or &quot;speak a little&quot; Ainu. As of 2001, Ainu was not taught in any elementary or secondary schools in Japan, but was offered at numerous language centres and universities in Hokkaido, as well as at Tokyo&#x27;s Chiba University.

==== Manchu ====

In China, the Manchu language is one of the most endangered languages, with speakers only in three small areas of Manchuria remaining. Some enthusiasts are trying to revive the language of their ancestors using available dictionaries and textbooks, and even occasional visits to Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County in Xinjiang, where the related Xibe language is still spoken natively.

==== Spanish ====

In the Philippines, a local variety of Spanish that was primarily based on Mexican Spanish was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the country since Spanish colonization in 1565 and was an official language alongside Filipino (standardized Tagalog) and English until 1987, following the ratification of a new constitution, where it was re-designated as a voluntary language. 

As a result of its loss as an official language and years of marginalization at the official level during and after American colonization, the use of Spanish amongst the overall populace decreased dramatically and became moribund, with the remaining native speakers left being mostly elderly people. 

The language has seen a gradual revival, however, due to official promotion under the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Most notably, Resolution No. 2006-028 reinstated Spanish as a mandatory subject in secondary schools and universities. Results were immediate as the job demand for Spanish speakers had increased since 2008. As of 2010, the Instituto Cervantes in Manila reported the number of Spanish-speakers in the country with native or non-native knowledge at approximately 3 million, the figure albeit including those who speak the Spanish-based creole Chavacano. 

Complementing government efforts is a notable surge of exposure through the mainstream media and, more recently, music-streaming services.

==== Western Armenian ====
The Western Armenian language, has been classified as a definitely endangered language in the &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; (2010), as most speakers of the dialect remain in diasporic communities away from their homeland in Anatolia, following the Armenian genocide. In spite of this, there have been various efforts to revitalize the language, especially within the Los Angeles community where the majority of Western Armenians reside.

Within her dissertation, Shushan Karapetian discusses at length the decline of the Armenian language in the United States, and new means for keeping and reviving Western Armenian, such as the creation of the Saroyan Committee or the Armenian Language Preservation Committee, launched in 2013. Other attempts at language revitalization can be seen within the University of California in Irvine.

==== Other Asian ====
In Thailand, there exists a Chong language revitalization project, headed by Suwilai Premsrirat.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the use of both local and learned languages declined as the central governments of the different states imposed their vernacular language as the standard throughout education and official use (this was the case in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and Greece, and to some extent, in Germany and Austria-Hungary).

In the last few [when?] decades, local nationalism and human rights movements have made a more multicultural policy standard in European states; sharp condemnation of the earlier practices of suppressing regional languages was expressed in the use of such terms as &quot;linguicide&quot;.

==== Basque ====
In Francoist Spain, Basque language use was discouraged by the government&#x27;s repressive policies. In the Basque Country, &quot;Francoist repression was not only political, but also linguistic and cultural.&quot; Franco&#x27;s regime suppressed Basque from official discourse, education, and publishing, making it illegal to register newborn babies under Basque names, and even requiring tombstone engravings in Basque to be removed. In some provinces the public use of Basque was suppressed, with people fined for speaking it. Public use of Basque was frowned upon by supporters of the regime, often regarded as a sign of anti-Francoism or separatism. in the late 1960s.

Since 1968, Basque has been immersed in a revitalisation process, facing formidable obstacles. However, significant progress has been made in numerous areas. Six main factors have been identified to explain its relative success: 
# implementation and acceptance of Unified, or Standard Basque (Euskara Batua), which was developed by the Euskaltzaindia
# integration of Basque in the education system
# creation of media in Basque (radio, newspapers, and television)
# the established new legal framework
# collaboration between public institutions and people&#x27;s organisations, and 
# campaigns for Basque language literacy.

While those six factors influenced the revitalisation process, the extensive development and use of language technologies is also considered a significant additional factor. Overall, in the 1960s and later, the trend reversed and education and publishing in Basque began to flourish. A sociolinguistic survey shows that there has been a steady increase in Basque speakers since the 1990s, and the percentage of young speakers exceeds that of the old.

==== Irish ====

One of the best known European attempts at language revitalization concerns the Irish language. While English is dominant through most of Ireland, Irish, a Celtic language, is still spoken in certain areas called &quot;Gaeltachtaí&quot;, but there it is in serious decline. The challenges faced by the language over the last few centuries have included exclusion from important domains, social denigration, the death or emigration of many Irish speakers during the Irish famine of the 1840s, and continued emigration since. Efforts to revitalise Irish were being made, however, from the mid-1800s, and were associated with a desire for Irish political independence. Contemporary Irish language revitalization has chiefly involved teaching Irish as a compulsory language in mainstream English-speaking schools. But the failure to teach it in an effective and engaging way means (as linguist Andrew Carnie notes) that students do not acquire the fluency needed for the lasting viability of the language, and this leads to boredom and resentment. Carnie also noted a lack of media in Irish (2006), though this is no longer the case.

The decline of the Gaeltachtaí and the failure of state-directed revitalisation have been countered by an urban revival movement. This is largely based on an independent community-based school system, known generally as Gaelscoileanna. These schools teach entirely through Irish and their number is growing, with over thirty such schools in Dublin alone. They are an important element in the creation of a network of urban Irish speakers (known as Gaeilgeoirí), who tend to be young, well-educated and middle-class. It is now likely that this group has acquired critical mass, a fact reflected in the expansion of Irish-language media. Irish language television has enjoyed particular success. It has been argued that they tend to be better educated than monolingual English speakers and enjoy higher social status. They represent the transition of Irish to a modern urban world, with an accompanying rise in prestige.

==== Scottish Gaelic ====
There are also current attempts to revive the related language of Scottish Gaelic, which was suppressed following the formation of the United Kingdom, and entered further decline due to the Highland clearances. Currently, Gaelic is only spoken widely in the Western Isles and some relatively small areas of the Highlands and Islands. The decline in fluent Gaelic speakers has slowed; however, the population center has shifted to L2 speakers in urban areas, especially Glasgow.

==== Manx ====

Another Celtic language, Manx, lost its last native speaker in 1974 and was declared extinct by UNESCO in 2009, but never completely fell from use. The language is now taught in primary and secondary schools, including as a teaching medium at the Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, used in some public events and spoken as a second language by approximately 1,800 people. Revitalization efforts include radio shows in Manx Gaelic and social media and online resources. The Manx government has also been involved in the effort by creating organizations such as the Manx Heritage Foundation (Culture Vannin) and the position of Manx Language Officer. The government has released an official Manx Language Strategy for 2017–2021.

==== Cornish ====
There have been a number of attempts to revive the Cornish language, both privately and some under the Cornish Language Partnership. Some of the activities have included translation of the Christian scriptures, a guild of bards, and the promotion of Cornish literature in modern Cornish, including novels and poetry.

==== Breton ====
==== Caló ====
The Romani arriving in the Iberian Peninsula developed an Iberian Romani dialect.
As time passed, Romani ceased to be a full language and became Caló, a cant mixing Iberian Romance grammar and Romani vocabulary.
With sedentarization and obligatory instruction in the official languages, Caló is used less and less.
As Iberian Romani proper is extinct and as Caló is endangered, some people are trying to revitalise the language. The Spanish politician Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia promotes Romanò-Kalò, a variant of International Romani, enriched by Caló words. His goal is to reunify the Caló and Romani roots.

==== Livonian ====

The Livonian language, a Finnic language, once spoken on about a third of modern-day Latvian territory, died in the 21st century with the death of the last native speaker Grizelda Kristiņa on 2 June 2013. Today there are about 210 people mainly living in Latvia who identify themselves as Livonian and speak the language on the A1-A2 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and between 20 and 40 people who speak the language on level B1 and up. Today all speakers learn Livonian as a second language. There are different programs educating Latvians on the cultural and linguistic heritage of Livonians and the fact that most Latvians have common Livonian descent.

Programs worth mentioning include:

* Livones.net with extensive information about language, history and culture
* The Livonian Institute of the University of Latvia doing research on the Livonian language, other Finnic languages in Latvia and providing an extensive Livonian-Latvian-Estonian dictionary with declinations/conjugations
* Virtual Livonia providing information on the Livonian language and especially its grammar
* Mierlinkizt: An annual summer camp for children to teach children about the Livonian language, culture etc.
* Līvõd Īt (Livonian Union)

The Livonian linguistic and cultural heritage is included in the Latvian cultural canon and the protection, revitalization and development of Livonian as an indigenous language is guaranteed by Latvian law

==== Old Prussian ====

A few linguists and philologists are involved in reviving a reconstructed form of the extinct Old Prussian language from Luther&#x27;s catechisms, the Elbing Vocabulary, place names, and Prussian loanwords in the Low Prussian dialect of Low German. Several dozen people use the language in Lithuania, Kaliningrad, and Poland, including a few children who are natively bilingual.

The Prusaspirā Society has published its translation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. The book was translated by Piotr Szatkowski (Pīteris Šātkis) and released in 2015. The other efforts of Baltic Prussian societies include the development of online dictionaries, learning apps and games. There also have been several attempts to produce music with lyrics written in the revived Baltic Prussian language, most notably in the Kaliningrad Oblast by Romowe Rikoito, Kellan and Āustras Laīwan, but also in Lithuania by Kūlgrinda in their 2005 album &quot;Prūsų Giesmės&quot; (Prussian Hymns), and in Latvia by Rasa Ensemble in 1988 and Valdis Muktupāvels in his 2005 oratorio &quot;Pārcēlātājs Pontifex&quot; featuring several parts sung in Prussian.

Important in this revival was Vytautas Mažiulis, who died on 11 April 2009, and his pupil Letas Palmaitis, leader of the experiment and author of the website &quot;Prussian Reconstructions&quot;. Two late contributors were Prāncis Arellis (Pranciškus Erelis), Lithuania, and Dailūns Russinis (Dailonis Rusiņš), Latvia. After them, Twankstas Glabbis from Kaliningrad oblast and Nērtiks Pamedīns from East-Prussia, now Polish Warmia-Masuria actively joined.

==== Yola ====
The Yola language revival movement has cultivated in Wexford in recent years, and the “Gabble Ing Yola” resource center for Yola materials claims there are around 140 speakers of the Yola language today.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====
The European colonization of Australia, and the consequent damage sustained by Aboriginal communities, had a catastrophic effect on indigenous languages, especially in the southeast and south of the country, leaving some with no living traditional native speakers. A number of Aboriginal communities in Victoria and elsewhere are now trying to revive some of these languages. The work is typically directed by a group of Aboriginal elders and other knowledgeable people, with community language workers doing most of the research and teaching. They analyze the data, develop spelling systems and vocabulary and prepare resources. Decisions are made in collaboration. Some communities employ linguists, and there are also linguists who have worked independently, such as Luise Hercus and Peter K. Austin.
* In the state of Queensland, an effort is being made to teach some Indigenous languages in schools and to develop workshops for adults. More than 150 languages were once spoken within the state, but today fewer than 20 are spoken as a first language, and less than two per cent of schools teach any Indigenous language. The Gunggari language is one language which is being revived, with only three native speakers left.
* In the Northern Territory, the Pertame Project is an example in Central Australia. Pertame, from the country south of Alice Springs, along the Finke River, is a dialect in the Arrernte group of languages. With only 20 fluent speakers left by 2018, the Pertame Project is seeking to retain and revive the language, headed by Pertame elder Christobel Swan.
* In the far north of South Australia, the Diyari language has an active programme under way, with materials available for teaching in schools and the wider community. Also in South Australia, there is a unit at the University of Adelaide which teaches and promotes the use of the Kaurna language, headed by Rob Amery, who has produced many books and course materials. 
* The Victorian Department of Education and Training reported 1,867 student enrollments in 14 schools offering an Aboriginal Languages Program in the state of Victoria in 2018.

==== New Zealand ====

One of the best cases of relative success in language revitalization is the case of Maori, also known as . It is the ancestral tongue of the indigenous Maori people of New Zealand and a vehicle for prose narrative, sung poetry, and genealogical recital. The history of the Maori people is taught in Maori in sacred learning houses through oral transmission. Even after Maori became a written language, the oral tradition was preserved.

Once European colonization began, many laws were enacted in order to promote the use of English over Maori among indigenous people. The Education Ordinance Act of 1847 mandated school instruction in English and established boarding schools to speed up assimilation of Maori youths into European culture. The Native School Act of 1858 forbade Māori from being spoken in schools.

During the 1970s, a group of young Maori people, the Ngā Tamatoa, successfully campaigned for Maori to be taught in schools. Also, Kōhanga Reo, Māori language preschools, called language nests, were established. The emphasis was on teaching children the language at a young age, a very effective strategy for language learning. The Maori Language Commission was formed in 1987, leading to a number of national reforms aimed at revitalizing Maori. They include media programmes broadcast in Maori, undergraduate college programmes taught in Maori, and an annual Maori language week. Each &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) created a language planning programme catering to its specific circumstances. These efforts have resulted in a steady increase in children being taught in Maori in schools since 1996.

==== Hawaiian ====

On six of the seven inhabited islands of Hawaii, Hawaiian was displaced by English and is no longer used as the daily language of communication. The one exception is Niʻihau, where Hawaiian has never been displaced, has never been endangered, and is still used almost exclusively. Efforts to revive the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian language immersion schools are now open to children whose families want to retain (or introduce) Hawaiian language into the next generation. The local National Public Radio station features a short segment titled &quot;Hawaiian word of the day&quot;. Additionally, the Sunday editions of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; and its successor, the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;, feature a brief article called &quot;Kauakūkalahale&quot;, written entirely in Hawaiian by a student.

== Current revitalization efforts ==
Language revitalization efforts are ongoing around the world. Revitalization teams are utilizing modern technologies to increase contact with indigenous languages and to record traditional knowledge.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, the Mixtec people&#x27;s language heavily revolves around the interaction between climate, nature, and what it means for their livelihood. UNESCO&#x27;s LINKS (Local and Indigenous Knowledge) program recently underwent a project to create a glossary of Mixtec terms and phrases related to climate. UNESCO believes that the traditional knowledge of the Mixtec people via their deep connection with weather phenomena can provide insight on ways to address climate change. Their intention in creating the glossary is to &quot;facilitate discussions between experts and the holders of traditional knowledge&quot;.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the Wapikoni Mobile project travels to indigenous communities and provides lessons in film making. Program leaders travel across Canada with mobile audiovisual production units, and aim to provide indigenous youth with a way to connect with their culture through a film topic of their choosing. The Wapikona project submits its films to events around the world as an attempt to spread knowledge of indigenous culture and language.

=== Chile ===
Of the youth in Rapa Nui (Easter Island), ten percent learn their mother language. The rest of the community has adopted Spanish in order to communicate with the outside world and support its tourism industry. Through a collaboration between UNESCO and the Chilean Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indigena, the Department of Rapa Nui Language and Culture at the Lorenzo Baeza Vega School was created. Since 1990, the department has created primary education texts in the Rapa Nui language. In 2017, the Nid Rapa Nui, a non-governmental organization was also created with the goal of establishing a school that teaches courses entirely in Rapa Nui.

== Health benefits of language revitalization ==
Language revitalisation has been linked to increased health outcomes for Indigenous communities involved in reclaiming traditional language. Benefits range from improved mental health for community members, increasing connectedness to culture, identity, and a sense of wholeness. Indigenous languages are a core element in the formation of identity, providing pathways for cultural expression, agency, spiritual and ancestral connection. Connection to culture is considered to play an important role in childhood development, and is a UN convention right.

Colonisation and subsequent linguicide carried out through policies such as those that created Australia&#x27;s Stolen Generations have damaged this connection. It has been proposed that language revitalization may play an important role in countering intergenerational trauma that has been caused. Researchers at the University of Adelaide and South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute have found that language revitalisation of Aboriginal languages is linked to better mental health. One study in the Barngarla Community in South Australia has been looking holistically at the positive benefits of language reclamation, healing mental and emotional scars, and building connections to community and country that underpin wellness and wholeness. The study identified the Barngarla peoples&#x27; connection to their language as a strong component of developing a strong cultural and personal identity; the people are as connected to language as they are to culture, and culture is key to their identity. Some proponents claim that language reclamation is a form of empowerment and builds strong connections with community and wholeness.

== Criticism ==
John McWhorter has argued that programs to revive indigenous languages will almost never be very effective because of the practical difficulties involved. He also argues that the death of a language does not necessarily mean the death of a culture. Indigenous expression is still possible even when the original language has disappeared, as with Native American groups and as evidenced by the vitality of black American culture in the United States, among people who speak not Yoruba but English. He argues that language death is, ironically, a sign of hitherto isolated peoples migrating and sharing space: &quot;To maintain distinct languages across generations happens only amidst unusually tenacious self-isolation—such as that of the Amish—or brutal segregation&quot;.

Kenan Malik has also argued that it is &quot;irrational&quot; to try to preserve all the world&#x27;s languages, as language death is natural and in many cases inevitable, even with intervention. He proposes that language death improves communication by ensuring more people speak the same language. This may benefit the economy and reduce conflict.

The protection of minority languages from extinction is often not a concern for speakers of the dominant language. There is often prejudice and deliberate persecution of minority languages, in order to appropriate the cultural and economic capital of minority groups. At other times governments deem that the cost of revitalization programs and creating linguistically diverse materials is too great to take on.

<text>William Perry Clements Jr. (April 13, 1917 – May 29, 2011) was an American businessman and Republican Party politician who served two nonconsecutive terms as the governor of Texas between 1979 and 1991. His terms bookended the sole term served by Mark Wells White, a Democrat who defeated Clements in the 1982 election only to lose his campaign for reelection in 1986.

When Clements was first sworn in 1979, he became the first Republican to have served as governor of Texas since Reconstruction. When Clements left office for good at the end of his second term in 1991, his eight years in office were the most served by any Texas governor until Rick Perry surpassed his total in 2009. Clements was the first governor to be elected to multiple terms since Texas changed its constitution in 1972 to extend its governor&#x27;s term of office to four years. Since then, George W. Bush, Rick Perry, and Greg Abbott, also Republicans, have all won multiple terms.

Before he became Governor of Texas, Clements made his fortune in crude oil and served as United States Deputy Secretary of Defense for President Richard Nixon. After his first gubernatorial term ended, Clements joined the administrative staff at Southern Methodist University where he served as chairman of the Board of Governors. While there, he presided over a massive pay-to-play system in the school&#x27;s football program that resulted in catastrophic consequences for the team and the end of his political career.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Dallas, Texas, Clements graduated from Highland Park High School in the Dallas suburb of University Park in 1934. Although Clements was an all-state offensive guard on the Highland Park football team, after his father lost his job due to the Great Depression, Clements worked as an oil driller in South Texas after graduating from high school. In the late 1930s, Clements studied engineering at Southern Methodist University before returning to the oil industry. During World War II, Clements served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

In 1947, Clements founded the offshore drilling business Southeastern Drilling Company (SEDCO), which would expand to 20 countries and grow into the top drilling contracting company in the world before being sold to Schlumberger in 1984. Clements had a personal wealth worth nearly $30 million by 1978, the year he first ran for Texas governor.

From 1973 to 1977, Clements served as United States Deputy Secretary of Defense under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. For 39 days in 1973, Clements served as acting Secretary of Defense.

Among the Secretaries of Defense he served under was Donald Rumsfeld, during the latter&#x27;s first tenure in the office. The two men did not get along, yet when Rumsfeld was appointed, Clements resisted efforts to be moved to another department, even going so far as to threaten, if removed from his office, to hold a press conference and label his dismissal a &quot;power play.&quot; Though Clements remained as deputy secretary, Clements later termed his time under Rumsfeld &quot;very unpleasant.&quot;

== First Term as Governor of Texas (1979–1983) ==

On January 16, 1979, Clements succeeded Democrat Dolph Briscoe as governor of Texas. To win the position, he first defeated state Representative Ray Hutchison in the Republican primary by a lopsided vote of 115,345 to 38,268. He won the general election held on November 7, 1978, by narrowly defeating Democratic former Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice John Luke Hill, who had also served six years as state attorney general. Clements polled 1,183,828 votes (49.96 percent) to Hill&#x27;s 1,166,919 votes (49.24 percent).

His first term was marked by SEDCO&#x27;s involvement in the largest oil blowout in history, the Ixtoc I oil spill, which caused extensive environmental damage. Clements faced heavily Democratic state legislatures during his tenure. In 1979, the legislature overrode one of his vetoes, the last time that Texas lawmakers had completed an override. In 1980, Clements commuted the death sentence of Randall Dale Adams to life in prison. Adams, the subject of &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, an Errol Morris documentary film, was exonerated in 1989 after serving twelve years in prison. Clements was also governor at the time of the execution of Carlos DeLuna, who was put to death in 1989; evidence questioning the findings of the facts that underlie DeLuna&#x27;s conviction was published in 2012.

Clements ran for reelection in 1982 but was defeated by Democratic Attorney General Mark Wells White by more than 327,000 votes because of sagging economic indicators and weak support from minority voters, who historically support Democratic candidates. Clements was also damaged politically by the Ixtoc I oil spill disaster; the rig that failed was owned by SEDCO, but leased to Permargo (a Mexican drilling firm), which had an exploration contract with Pemex, despite his shares in SEDCO, being held in blind trust at the time. His opponent, White, as attorney general, led the state&#x27;s lawsuit against SEDCO. White received 1,697,870 votes (53.2 percent) to Clements&#x27;s 1,465,537 (45.9 percent).

== Staging the 1986 comeback ==
In between his two terms as governor, Clements was chairman of the board of governors of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He ran again in 1986 and won a contested GOP primary against U.S. Representative Thomas Loeffler of New Braunfels, the seat of Comal County, and former Democratic-turned-Republican Congressman Kent Hance of Lubbock. In the fall, Clements unseated Governor White, who was hurt by the unpopularity of the &quot;no pass/no play&quot; policy involving high school athletics and proposed teacher competency testing. In gaining his second term, Clements polled 1,813,779 ballots (52.7 percent) to White&#x27;s 1,584,512 (46.1 percent). Clements had turned the tables on White in a near mathematical reversal of the 1982 results and was inaugurated for a second nonconsecutive term on January 20, 1987, just after White came &quot;struggling up to Clements in the Capitol rotunda&quot; and extended a hand for a handshake with congratulations, and Clements simply shook it without comment and turned away.

== Second term as Governor of Texas (1987–1991) ==
Clements&#x27;s second term was marred by a startling revelation he made two months after taking office. On March 3, 1987, Clements admitted that he and the other members of the SMU board of governors had approved a secret plan to continue payments to 13 football players from a slush fund provided by a booster. Clements said that the board agreed to &quot;phase out&quot; the slush fund at the end of the 1986 season but that it felt duty-bound to honour prior commitments to the players. The decision to continue the payments ultimately led to the NCAA shutting down the football program for the 1987 season—the so-called &quot;death penalty.&quot; SMU then opted not to field a team in 1988 either, claiming it could not put together a competitive squad. The shutdown and other sanctions left the once-proud Mustang football program in ruin; SMU would not procure another bowl bid until 2009, and it would also be another ten years before they would be ranked in the top 25 in the Amway Coaches Poll by USA Today. A few months later, the College of Bishops of the United Methodist Church released a report detailing an investigation of its own into the scandal. It revealed that Clements had met with athletic director Bob Hitch, and the two agreed that the payments had to continue because the football program had &quot;a payroll to meet.&quot;

According to the report, in late 1985, then SMU President L. Donald Shields and board of trustees chairman Edwin L. Cox wanted to stop the payments completely, in opposition to Clements and Hitch. The four held a &quot;most important meeting&quot; in August 1985 in Shields&#x27;s office in the SMU administration building, Perkins Hall. Shields and Cox noted that although earlier in the year a phase-out of the payments had been agreed upon by SMU leadership, the NCAA had just enacted the &quot;death penalty&quot; for repeat violators (of which SMU was one, having been cited six times to that point by the organization and twice in the last five years) for violations occurring on or after September 1 of that year, and thus the situation had changed. But Clements, admitting his way would be &quot;taking a chance,&quot; argued that if the payments were stopped immediately, star players receiving them would be sure to leave SMU and publicly announce why. Nothing was formally decided at the meeting, but afterwards, Clements and Hitch talked for about fifteen minutes in the Perkins Hall parking lot. Hitch remembered Clements asking him if the payments could be continued and, upon hearing that they could, telling him in no uncertain terms to &quot;do it.&quot; And the payments continued (on at least two occasions starting in 1983, after President Shields expressed outrage over the payments and said they had to stop, Clements, an SMU dropout, told the PhD holder Shields to &quot;stay out of it&quot; and to &quot;go run the university&quot;).

A week later, Clements apologised for his role in continuing the payments. He said that he had learned about the slush fund in 1984, and an investigation by the board of governors revealed that players had been paid to play since the mid-1970s. Clements said that rather than shutting down the payments immediately, the board &quot;reluctantly and uncomfortably&quot; decided to continue paying players who had already been guaranteed payments. However, he said, in hindsight, the board &quot;should have stopped (the payments) immediately,&quot; rather than merely phase them out.

Clements faced calls for his impeachment as a result of these statements; two state legislators argued that he would have never been elected had he honestly addressed his role in the scandal. Under the circumstances, he opted not to run for a third term as governor and was succeeded on January 15, 1991, by Democratic State Treasurer Ann Richards.

During his second term, Clements worked to reduce crime, improve education, boost the Texas economy, and foster better relations with Mexico, especially on issues important to the mutual borders, such as immigration and the War on Drugs. However, he did not push as pledged for the initiative and referendum reforms advocated by State Senator Walter Mengden of Houston, based on the principle of California&#x27;s Proposition 13.

== Post-political life ==

In June 2009, Clements donated $100 million to UT Southwestern Medical Center, the largest civic donation in Dallas history. On April 13, 2012, Daniel K. Podolsky, President of UT Southwestern Medical Center announced that the UT System Board of Regents had approved the naming of the new UT Southwestern University Hospital in honor of Clements. On February 16, 2010, Clements and his wife both endorsed Governor Rick Perry&#x27;s re-election campaign in the 2010 Texas Republican gubernatorial primary against Kay Bailey Hutchison. Clements, incidentally, won the Republican nomination that ultimately led to his first term as governor by defeating Hutchison&#x27;s husband, Ray, in the 1978 GOP primary.

In October 2010, Clements&#x27;s son, B. Gill Clements, was murdered at the age of 69 near his ranch in Athens in Henderson County, east Texas. An investor, Clements was also a graduate of Southern Methodist University, married, and the father of three children. He was predeceased by his mother, Pauline Allen Gill Clements, Bill Clements&#x27;s first wife.

== Death ==
On May 29, 2011, Clements died at age 94 in a Dallas-area hospital from natural causes. He is buried at Grove Hill Memorial Park in Dallas.

<doc id="577332" wikidata="Q7578120" url="?curid=577332" title="Spiritual death in Christianity">
<text>In Christian theology, spiritual death is separation from God caused by sin.

==Protestantism==

The phrase &quot;spiritual death&quot; is not found in Protestant scriptures, and definitions of the concept thus vary among Protestant Christians. Spiritual death is distinct from physical death and the second death. According to the doctrine of original sin, all people have a sinful nature and thus commit sin, and are thereby spiritually dead. Those who have faith in Jesus Christ are thereafter made spiritually alive. The unbeliever&#x27;s physical death, subsequent resurrection, and final judgment is followed by the second death.

==Mormonism==
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints make a distinction between two types of spiritual death, respectively termed a &quot;temporal separation&quot; and a &quot;spiritual separation&quot; from God.

The first type is a physical separation from God the Father, which was caused by the Fall of Adam and Eve. Because of their choice, all their descendants are born into a fallen world that is physically separated from God&#x27;s presence. This separation is necessary so that individuals can be tested to see whether they will continue to be obedient even when not in God&#x27;s presence. This separation is overcome unconditionally when all people return to God&#x27;s physical presence for the Judgment, according to Gerald N. Lund.

The second type is a spiritual separation from God&#x27;s spirit or influence, which is caused by individual sins; when we sin we alienate ourselves from the influence of the Holy Ghost, God&#x27;s spiritual presence. This separation is absolutely unnecessary, and only impedes our growth and ability to develop Godly attributes. This separation begins its resolution through the covenant of baptism, after which a person receives the gift of the Holy Ghost. It is only overcome on the conditions of faith and repentance.

This distinction between two kinds of spiritual death gives Mormonism a unique approach to the problem of evil, compared to the rest of Christianity. That is, it obviates the need to explain the suffering of innocents with reference to Adam and Eve&#x27;s sin. Instead, it allows for mortal pain and suffering to be necessary without implying that sinning is necessary.

<text>The Jatiya Sangsad (, ), often simply referred to as Sangsad and also known as the House of the Nation, is the supreme legislative body of Bangladesh. The current parliament of Bangladesh contains 350 seats, including 50 seats reserved exclusively for women. Elected occupants are called members of Parliament, or MPs. The 12th national parliamentary election was held on 7 January 2024. Elections to the body are held every five years, unless a parliament is dissolved earlier by the President of Bangladesh. On 6 August 2024, President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament after the resignation of Sheikh Hasina and ordered to form an interim government.

The leader of the party (or alliance of parties) holding the majority of seats becomes the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and so the head of the government. The President of Bangladesh, the ceremonial head of state, is chosen by Parliament. Since the December 2008 national election, the majority party has been the Awami League led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The parliament has been dissolved by President Mohammed Shahabuddin on 6 August 2024 following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina.

==Etymology==
The Constitution of Bangladesh designates the official name of the legislature Jatiya Sangsad () in Bengali and House of the Nation in English. The term &quot;Sangsad&quot; (), a Bengali word for &quot;Parliament&quot;, derives from the Sanskrit word (). The Bengali word Jatiya means National, hence, the name Jatiya Sangsad translates to National Parliament. The legislature is commonly known as Parliament and often referred to simply as the Sangsad or JS.

The term &quot;member of Parliament&quot; () refers to both the 300 elected members and the 50 nominated women members of the Sangsad. The title is almost always shortened to the initialism &quot;MP&quot; and often referred to simply as the &quot;Sāṁsada&quot; in Bengali. Members of Parliament are entitled to use the prefix &quot;The Honourable&quot; ().

==History==
The Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh was established on 10 April 1972 after the Bangladesh Liberation War to prepare a democratic constitution and served as its first parliament as an independent nation. The assembly approved the constitution on 4 November 1972, and it took effect on 16 December and the Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of Bangladesh until the first elections under the new constitution took place in 1973.

Until 10 July 1981 the Constituent Assembly, and the first and second parliaments held their sittings in the building that now houses the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and which is often referred to as the old Sangsad Bhaban (old Parliament House). The opening ceremony of the present Parliament House was performed on 15 February 1982. The last session of the second parliament was held in the new house on 15 February 1982.

==Constituencies==
The maximum strength of the Parliament envisaged by the Constitution of Bangladesh is 350, which is made up of the general election of 300 members to represent 300 parliamentary constituencies and 50 seats reserved for women, which are apportioned to elected party positions in the parliament. The electoral districts are referred to as &quot;Nirbācanī ēlākā&quot; () in Bengali, which can be literally translated to English as &quot;electoral area&quot; though the official English translation for the term is &quot;constituency&quot;. The term &quot;Nirbācanī ēlākā&quot; is used while referring to an electoral district in general. The constituencies are arranged to coincide with the administrative districts of Bangladesh, distributed among the proportion to their population. Numbers may vary from two to twenty members per district. The seats are indicated with the district name suffixed by a number (e.g., Panchagarh-1 or Jessore-6). Each constituency is represented by a single member of Parliament, and is elected by the first-past-the-post system.

==Membership==
Article 66 of the Constitution makes membership open to any citizen of Bangladesh and &quot;only&quot; to citizens above the age of 25; dual citizenship is possible for civilians in Bangladesh, but not for MPs who must not hold any other citizenship.

Members are elected by direct polling in their respective constituencies. Whoever wins the most votes, regardless of turnout or proportion, wins the election. Members are elected for a term of five years, with the entire Parliament dissolving five years after the swearing-in. Members can be re-elected indefinitely, and so have no term limits. They may be independent or affiliated with a political party.

Members must not have served time in prison for more than two years to be eligible, unless they served this period five years prior to the general election date.

Article 67 states that members absent without leave for 90 consecutive sitting days will lose their membership. Any ambiguity regarding membership will be resolved by the Bangladesh Election Commission. Attending sessions without being a member (even if memberships are cancelled in retrospect) results in a BDT1,000 (US$) fine per day, per Article 69.

===Floor crossing===
Article 70 of the Constitution makes floor crossing illegal. Members engaging in floor crossing lose their membership immediately.

Floor crossing is described in the Constitution as:
*Resignation from the political party that nominated the member,
*Voting against the nominating party, or
*Abstaining from voting, either by abstention or absence and against the directive of the party Whip.

The only case of floor crossing in Bangladeshi history due the stringent article was when members M. A. Mannan and Mahi B. Chowdhury defected from the Bangladesh National Party to form a new party, Bikolpo Dhara. Fresh by-elections were held soon after the seats were vacated. Mahi B. Chowdhury retained his seat under the new party, whereas Mannan lost.

====Debate about the provision====
As most candidates are elected by the funding, support and brand name of the party, and resignation from the party is considered to void the choice of the people. The prime objective of banning floor crossing is to prevent members from joining other parties for personal gains or to induce disloyalty. This is crucial in marginal majorities, where a few members voting against the majority essentially changes the government party in power causing political instability.

The negative effects are broad however such as stopping members from speaking out against bad policies pitched by their party or voting against their party on legislation. This is considered harmful to parliamentary democracy, as the ban forces members to agree with their party leaders regardless of their own opinions or the opinions of their constituents.

===Vandalism on 5 August 2024===
On 5 August 2024, after the fall of Sheikh Hasina, Sangsad Bhaban was heavily vandalised by the protagonists of Hasina&#x27;s ouster. Damaged and looted possessions includes Air conditioner, lifts, lights, electric lines, gates and numerous other infrastructural belongings. It is estimated that nearly 300 crore BDT will be required to repair the loss. 192 rooms of nearby MP hostel, a place reserved for the member of parliaments were also harmed.

===Double membership===
Article 71 of the Constitution allows eligible people to be candidates in more than one constituency. However, if elected from multiple seats, the member must vacate all but one seat.

It is usually the custom for prominent politicians, especially party leaders to stand in multiple constituencies. During the 2008 election Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina, prominent AL figure (and later prime minister of Bangladesh) Zillur Rahman, BNP leader Khaleda Zia and Jatiya Party leader H M Ershad all were candidates in the maximum possible number of constituencies.

==Powers and rights==

The president of Bangladesh appoints a cabinet with the prime minister and other ministers from among the members. The prime minister must be a parliamentarian, and so must at least 90% of the ministers. The president must appoint a prime minister who, in his reasoned opinion, commands the confidence of the majority of the House. The cabinet remains answerable to the Parliament and the president.

The president of Bangladesh is elected by the Parliament through open ballot voting. As a result, the opposition party seldom nominates a candidate and the governing party nominee is uncontested. Current President Mohammed Shahabuddin and previous presidents Abdul Hamid, Zillur Rahman, Iajuddin Ahmed, A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury and Shahabuddin Ahmed were all elected unopposed. The Parliament can also impeach the president by a two-thirds majority.

The Parliament can form any parliamentary standing committees as it sees fit such as for the purposes of examining bills, reviewing government policy and any other matter of public importance. The &quot;de facto&quot; power of the committees has always been nominal however; the &quot;de jure&quot; power too is ambiguous, especially after the Supreme Court ruled that it was not answerable to summons from parliamentary committees and senior civil servants rarely being brought before committees to answer for public administrative decisions.

In practice, the Parliament has been regarded as a rubber stamp body as MPs cannot cross the floor, have free votes (vote against their party whip) or pass motions of no confidence due to Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh. This article imposes ultra-strict party discipline on the chamber; any MP voting against their party automatically loses their seat. Political scientists, judges in the Supreme Court, public intellectuals, newspapers and journalists, civil rights activists and many members of parliament have demanded reform of the article.

Critics argue Article 70 tramples freedom of speech and freedom of conscience and is a violation of the constitution&#x27;s fundamental rights. Additionally, it significantly limits the checks and balances on the prime minister, as there are few means by which s/he can be legally dismissed under the constitution or even held to basic scrutiny with repercussions. In Bangladesh, the parliament usually reflects the will of the government, not vice versa as in a well-functioning parliamentary democracy. The checks and balances then formed on the prime minister and their cabinet are by civil servants in the Bangladesh Administrative Service and the courts, which are usually too docile to challenge the executive.

Article 78 of the Constitution provides immunity for the speeches, actions and votes of the Members within parliamentary sessions, and so members are not answerable for any such actions to the courts. The parliament itself is vested with the power to provide indemnity to anybody in service of the nation under Article 46. This allowed the 2nd parliament in 1979 to ratify the Indemnity Ordinance.

==Past parliamentary election results==

==Organisation==
===Parliamentary groups===
The parliamentary groups of the Jatiya Sangsad are groups of members of Parliament organised by a political party or coalition of parties. The leadership of each groups consists of a parliamentary party leader, deputy leader, whips and a parliamentary working committee. The size of a group determines the extent of its representation on legislative committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the parliament.
*Current composition
**Government coalition
***Leader of the House; the post is usually held by the prime minister of Bangladesh
***Deputy Leader of the House (who leads the day-to-day business of the government in the Parliament)
***Chief Whip (who is supported by six additional whips)
**Official opposition
***Leader of the Opposition
***Deputy Leader of the Opposition
***Chief Whip of the Opposition

===Executive bodies===
The Parliament&#x27;s executive bodies include the speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad, the House Committee and the Parliament Secretariat. The House Committee consists of the parliament speaker, deputy speaker and whips. Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party&#x27;s discipline and behaviour of its members on the floor of the house. The committee is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on parliamentary group representation. The Parliament Secretariat, headed by a senior secretary from the Bangladesh Administrative Service, is in charge of all its supporting and advisory duties such as keeping a record of members&#x27; voting, speeches, advising on protocol, general clerical, broadcasting and information activities.
*Current composition:
**Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad
**Deputy Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad
**House Committee
**Parliament Secretariat

===Committees===
Most of the legislative work in the Parliament is done in the standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period. The Parliament has several committees, with small numbers of members appointed to deal with particular topics or issues. The Committees on Ministry (CoM) are committees that are set down under the Parliament&#x27;s standing orders. The number of Committees in the Ministry approximates the number of ministries of Bangladesh, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defence, agriculture, and labour). There are, as of the current tenth Parliament, 50 standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various Parliamentary groups in the house.
*Current committees:
**Committee on Estimates
**Committee on Government Assurances
**Standing Committee on Public Accounts
**Library Committee
**Committee on Petitions
**Committee on Private Member&#x27;s Bills and Resolutions
**Standing Committee of Privileges
**House Committee
**Business Advisory Committee
**Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure
**Committee on Public Undertakings
**39 Committees on Ministry (CoMs)

==Structures==
===Parliament House===

The parliament is housed in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban (জাতীয় সংসদ ভবন &quot;Jatiyô Sôngsôd Bhôbôn&quot;), located at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka. Designed by the American architect Louis Kahn, the building is one of the largest legislative complexes in the world, comprising . Louis Kahn designed the entire Jatiya Sangsad complex, which includes lawns, lake and residences for the members of the Parliament (MPs). The main building, which is at the center of the complex, is divided into three parts – the Main Plaza, South Plaza and Presidential Plaza.
===Sangsad Library===
The Sangsad Library or Parliament Library claims to be the most comprehensive in Bangladesh, holding over 85,000 books and many more reports, parliamentary debates, government gazettes, journals, magazines and newspapers. The library is housed in Sangsad Bhaban in Sher e Bangla Nagar, Dhaka. The library was established in 1972, after the immediate formation of the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh to support the lawmakers and their staff. The library is administered by the parliamentary librarian, a statutory officer responsible for the control and management of the facility, reporting to the deputy speaker and the Library Committee. Although the library is open to the public, only current and former members of Parliament, secretariat staff, and authorised researchers may check out books and materials.

===Sangsad Television===

The Sangsad Bangladesh Television (publicly known as Sangsad TV) is a digital television channel in Bangladesh. It broadcasts parliamentary activity following its establishment under the Broadcasting Act 2011. Prior to the establishment of the Sangsad TV, the Sangsad&#x27;s programming was produced by the Ministry of Information and relayed in its Bangladesh Television.

<text>California State University, Fullerton (CSUF or Cal State Fullerton) is a public research university in Fullerton, California. With a total enrollment of more than 41,000, it has the largest student body of the California State University (CSU) system, and its graduate student body of more than 5,000 is one of the largest in the CSU and in all of California. As of fall 2016, the school had 2,083 faculty, of whom 782 were on the tenure track. The university offers 109 degree programs: 55 undergraduate degrees and 54 graduate degrees, including 3 doctoral programs.

Cal State Fullerton is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It is also a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) and is eligible to be designated as an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander serving institution (AANAPISI).

CSUF athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the CSUF Titans. They compete in the Big West Conference.

==History==

===Founding===
In 1957, Orange County State College became the 12th state college in California to be authorized by the state legislature as a degree-granting institution. The following year, a site was designated for the campus to be established in northeast Fullerton. The property was purchased in 1959. The same year, William B. Langsdorf was appointed as founding president of the school.

Classes began with 452 students in September 1959. The name of the school was changed to Orange State College in July 1962. In 1964, its name was changed to California State College at Fullerton. In June 1972, the final name change occurred and the school became California State University, Fullerton.

===Mascot===
The choice of the elephant as the university&#x27;s mascot, dubbed Tuffy the Titan, dates to 1962, when the campus hosted &quot;The First Intercollegiate Elephant Race in Human History.&quot; The May 11 event attracted 10,000 spectators, 15 pachyderm entrants, and worldwide news coverage.

===Campus violence===

The campus has seen three significant instances of violence with people killed. On July 12, 1976, Edward Charles Allaway, a campus janitor with paranoid schizophrenia, shot nine people, killing seven, in the University Library (now the Pollak Library) on the Cal State Fullerton campus. At the time, it was the worst mass shooting in Orange County history.

On October 13, 1984, Edward Cooperman, a physics professor, was shot and killed by his former student, Minh Van Lam, in McCarthy Hall.

On August 19, 2019, Steven Shek Keung Chan, a retired budget director working as a consultant in the international student affairs office, was found dead from multiple stab wounds in a campus parking lot. Chuyen Vo, a co-worker in the same office, was charged with murder.

===2000s: Modern growth===
The university grew rapidly in the first decade of the 2000s. The Performing Arts Center was built in January 2006, and in the summer of 2008 the newly constructed Steven G. Mihaylo Hall and the new Student Recreation Center opened.

In fall 2008, the Performing Arts Center was renamed the Joseph A.W. Clayes III Performing Arts Center, in honor of a $5 million pledge made to the university by the trustees of the Joseph A.W. Clayes III Charitable Trust. Since 1963, the curriculum has expanded to include many graduate programs, including multiple doctorate degrees, as well as numerous credential and certificate programs.

In 2021, president of the university Framroze Virjee acknowledged the university&#x27;s location on the lands of the Tongva and Acjachemen and pledged for the university to be more committed toward partnering with Indigenous peoples.

==Campus==

The campus is on the site of former citrus groves in northeast Fullerton. It is bordered on the east by the Orange Freeway (SR-57), on the west by State College Boulevard, on the north by Yorba Linda Boulevard, and on the south by Nutwood Avenue.

Although established in the late 1950s, much of the initial construction on campus took place in the late 1960s, under the supervision of artist and architect Howard van Heuklyn, who gave the campus a striking, futuristic architecture (buildings like Pollak Library South, Titan Shops, Humanities, McCarthy Hall). This was in response to the numerous Googie buildings in the Fullerton community.

The University Archives &amp; Special Collections in the Pollak Library houses the Philip K. Dick papers and Frank Herbert papers as part of the Willis McNelly Science Fiction collection.

Since 1993, the campus has added the College Park Building, Steven G. Mihaylo Hall, University Hall, the Titan Student Union, the Student Recreation Center, the Nutwood Parking Structure, the State College Parking Structure, Dan Black Hall, Joseph A.W. Clayes III Performing Arts Center West, Phase III Housing, the Grand Central Art Center, and Pollak Library. In order to generate power for the university and become more sustainable, the campus installed solar panels on top of a number of buildings. The panels, which generate up to 7–8 percent of the electrical power used daily, are atop the Eastside Parking Structure, Clayes Performing Arts Center and the Kinesiology and Health Science Building.

In August 2011, the university added a $143 million housing complex, which included five new residence halls, a convenience store and a 565-seat dining hall called the Gastronome.
El Dorado Ranch serves as the university president&#x27;s residence.

===Satellite campus===
The university opened a satellite campus in Irvine, California in 1989, approximately south of the original Fullerton location. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the satellite campus closed in July 2021.

===Proposed expansion===
CSUF announced plans in May 2010 to buy the lot occupied by Hope International University, but this deal fell through.

CSUF also announced plans in September 2010 to expand into the area south of Nutwood Avenue to construct a project called CollegeTown, which would integrate the surrounding residential areas and retail spaces into the campus. After community opposition, the Fullerton planning commission indefinitely postponed any action on the project in February 2016.

===Desert Studies Center===
The Desert Studies Center is a field station of the California State University located in Zzyzx, California in the Mojave Desert. The purpose of the center is to provide opportunities to conduct research, receive instruction and experience the Mojave Desert environment. It is officially operated by the California Desert Studies Consortium, a consortium of 7 CSU campuses: Fullerton, Cal Poly Pomona, Long Beach, San Bernardino, Northridge, Dominguez Hills and Los Angeles.

<doc id="577347" wikidata="Q7916011" url="?curid=577347" title="Varnam">
<text>Varṇam is a type of composition in the Carnatic music system that encapsulates the key features of a raga, and considered as a foundational element in the learning path. Varnams capture the essence of the ragam in terms of typical swara patterns used, vishesha prayogas, highlighting the main notes (jeeva swaras), etc. This forms the basis for creative presentation (manodharma) of the raga in the form of raga aalapana, kalpana swarams and neraval.

Varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music. All varnams consist of lyrics, as well as &quot;swara&quot; passages, including a &quot;pallavi&quot;, an &quot;anupallavi&quot;, &quot;muktaayi swaras&quot;, a &quot;charanam&quot;, and &quot;chitta swaras&quot;. There are different types of varnams, such as &quot;taana varnam&quot;, &quot;pada varnam&quot;, &quot;daru varnam&quot; and &quot;ragamalika varnam&quot;. They also come in different &quot;taalams&quot; (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in &quot;Aadi&quot; and &quot;Ata taalas&quot;, there are a number of varnams in other &quot;talas&quot; as well (e.g., &quot;jampa tala&quot;, &quot;triputa tala&quot;, &quot;matya talam&quot;, &quot;roopaka talam&quot;, etc).

A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music, varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.

Pallavi|&quot;tanam&quot;]]-like rhythmic qualities, &quot;tana varnams&quot; only have lyrics for the &quot;pallavi&quot;, &quot;anupallavi&quot; and &quot;charanam&quot;.

With rhythmic elements like a &quot;padam&quot;, &quot;pada varnams&quot; are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including &quot;bharatanatyam&quot;. Unlike the &quot;tana varnam&quot; which only has lyrics for the &quot;pallavi&quot;, &quot;anupallavi&quot; and &quot;charanam&quot; and swaras for the rest of the sections, a &quot;pada varnam&quot; also has lyrics that correspond to the &quot;muktaayi&quot; and &quot;chitta swaras&quot; of the varnam, so generally, &quot;pada varnams&quot; contain more lyrical content than a &quot;tana varnam&quot;. The &quot;swaras&quot; in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork. &quot;Padajathi varnams&quot; are simply &quot;pada varnams&quot; that also contain &quot;jatis&quot;, making them again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.

==Contents of a varnam==
The name &quot;varnam&quot; (meaning &#x27;letter&#x27;) was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of &quot;swara&quot; letters in this type of composition.

Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.

The varnam consists of two parts: poorvadham (first half) - consisting of pallavi, anupallavi and muktaayi swaram and uttarardham (second half) - consisting of charanam and charana swarams. Some of the older compositions have a part called &quot;Anubandham&quot; following this.

*Pallavi: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics (sahitya).
*Anupallavi: Second section, also sung with lyrics (sahitya).
*Muktaayi Swaram (also called Chitta Swaram): Sung completely with notes. In Pada Varnams, corresponding lyrics are present, which will be sung after the notes are sung.
*Charanam or Eththugada Pallavi: Sung with lyrics
*Chitta Swaram or Eththugadda Swaram: Sung with notes. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.
*Anubandham: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have an additional part that is sung with lyrics (&quot;sahitya&quot;), and leading back to the &quot;muktaayi&quot; (&quot;chitta&quot;) &quot;swara&quot; or the first &quot;pallavi&quot; line itself. It is found more often with very old varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, performers rarely sing the anubandham (ie., the rendering is concluded after charana swarams, leading back to the charanam).

Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of &quot;pallavi&quot;, &quot;anupallavi&quot; and &quot;chitta swaram&quot; (&quot;mukthayi swaram&quot;) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (&quot;charanam&quot; onwards) is sung in a &quot;madhyama kala&quot; or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each &quot;swara&quot; passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the &quot;charanam&quot;. Some performers do not follow this, though, preferring to sing the entire composition in &quot;madhyama kala&quot; or relatively fast pace.

Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of &quot;talas&quot;, or meter systems, &quot;adi tala&quot; (eight-beat cycle) and &quot;ata tala&quot; (fourteen-beat cycle), where &quot;ata tala&quot; varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the &quot;adi tala&quot; varnams, the &quot;tala&quot; is placed in the two-&quot;kalai&quot; version, so therefore, each beat and finger count is placed twice.

==Famous varnams==

&quot;Adi Tala&quot; varnams include:
*&quot;Sami Ninne&quot; in &quot;Shree ragam&quot; composed by &quot;Karur Devudu Iyer&quot; in Telugu
*&quot;Ninnukori&quot; in &quot;Mohanam ragam&quot; by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu
*&quot;Evvari Bodhana&quot; in &quot;Abhogi ragam&quot; by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu
*&quot;Era Naapai&quot; in &quot;Todi raagam&quot; by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu

&quot;Ata Tala&quot; varnams include:
*&quot;Viriboni&quot; in &quot;Bhairavi ragam&quot; by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu
*&quot;Nera Nammiti&quot; in &quot;Kaanada raagam&quot; by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu
*&quot;Chalamela&quot; in &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; by Swati Tirunal in Telugu

The &quot;Arabhi&quot; ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with &quot;jantai&quot; and &quot;dhatu prayogas&quot;.

The &quot;Mathe Malayadhwaja&quot; by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique varnam because the chitta swara has two different types of &quot;saahitya&quot; arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is embodied in expression by &quot;bharatanatyam&quot; dancers.

<doc id="577353" wikidata="Q843413" url="?curid=577353" title="Kawanishi N1K">
<text>The Kawanishi N1K is an Imperial Japanese Navy fighter aircraft which was developed in two forms: the N1K &quot;Kyōfū (, &quot;Strong Wind&quot;, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|reporting name]]Rex), a [[floatplane]] designed to support forward offensive operations where no airstrips were available, and theN1K-J &quot;Shiden (, &quot;Violet Lightning&quot;, reporting name George), a land-based version of the N1K. The N1K-J was considered by both its pilots and opponents to be one of the finest land-based fighters flown by the Japanese during World War II.

An improved variant, the N1K2-J &quot;Shiden-Kai&quot; (紫電改) first flew on 1 January 1944. The &quot;Shiden Kai&quot; possessed heavy armament, as well as surprisingly good maneuverability, due to a mercury switch that automatically extended the flaps during turns. These &quot;combat&quot; flaps created more lift, thereby allowing tighter turns. Unlike the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the &quot;Shiden Kai&quot; could compete against the best late-war Allied fighters, such as the F6F Hellcat, F4U Corsair, and P-51 Mustang.

==Design and development==
Kawanishi&#x27;s N1K was originally built as a single pontoon floatplane fighter to support forward offensive operations where no airstrips were available, but by 1943 when the aircraft entered service, Japan was firmly on the defensive, and there was no longer a need for a fighter to fulfill this role. The Navy&#x27;s requirements for this fighter were nearly impossible to achieve for a float plane, and the expected protracted development period led Nakajima to develop an interim float plane fighter based on the Zero, the Nakajima A6M2-N. In the end, the &quot;Kyofu&quot; only saw limited service, mostly in Southeast Asia. A number were flown out of Ambon and the Aru Islands in the Moluccas, while some were stationed at Penang Island, off the Malayan peninsula. They were also used in the Battle of Okinawa. Towards the end of the war, &quot;Kyofu&quot;s were also used in the homeland defense role, operating from Lake Biwa by the Sasebo Air Corps and the Ōtsu Air Corps.

The N1K was powered by the Mitsubishi MK4C &quot;Kasei&quot; 13 14-cylinder radial engine. Top speed was ; considerably less than the unrealistic Navy requirement.

===Land-based version===
The requirement to carry a bulky, heavy float essentially crippled the N1K against contemporary American fighters. However, Kawanishi engineers had proposed, in late 1941, that the N1K would also be the basis of a formidable land-based fighter, and a land-based version was produced as a private venture by the company. This version flew on 27 December 1942, powered by a Nakajima NK9A &quot;Homare&quot; 11 18-cylinder radial engine, replacing the less powerful MK4C &quot;Kasei&quot; 13 of the N1K-1. The aircraft retained the mid-mounted wing of the floatplane; combined with the large propeller, this necessitated a long, stalky main landing gear. A unique feature was the aircraft&#x27;s combat flaps that automatically adjusted in response to acceleration, freeing up the pilot&#x27;s concentration, and reducing the chance of stalling in combat. However, the N1K did have temperamental flight characteristics that required an experienced touch at the controls.

The Nakajima &quot;Homare&quot; was powerful but had been rushed into production before it was sufficiently developed and proved troublesome. Another problem was landing gear failure due to poor heat treatment of the wheels. Apart from engine problems and the landing gear, the flight test program showed that the aircraft was promising. Prototypes were evaluated by the Navy, and since the aircraft was faster than the Zero and had a much longer range than the Mitsubishi J2M &quot;Raiden&quot;, it was ordered into production as the N1K1-J, the -J indicating a land-based fighter modification of the original floatplane fighter.

Only four days after the &quot;Shiden&quot;″s first test flight, a complete redesign began. The N1K2-J addressed the N1K1-J&#x27;s major defects, primarily the mid-mounted wing and long landing gear. The wings were moved to a low position, which permitted the use of a shorter, conventional undercarriage. The fuselage was lengthened and the tail redesigned. The production of the entire aircraft was simplified: over a third of the parts used in the previous &quot;Shiden&quot; could still be used in its successor, while construction used fewer critical materials. The N1K1 redesign was approximately lighter, while faster and more reliable than its predecessor. The &quot;Homare&quot; engine was retained, even though reliability problems persisted, as no alternative was available. A prototype of the new version flew on 1 January 1944. After completing Navy trials in April, the N1K2-J was rushed into production. This variant was named the &quot;Shiden-Kai&quot; (紫電改) with &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;modified&quot;.

==Operational history==
The N1K1-J &quot;Shiden&quot; entered service in early 1944. The N1K1-J and the N1K2 &quot;Shiden-Kai&quot; released later that year were among the rare Japanese aircraft that offered pilots an even chance against late-war American designs, such as the F6F Hellcat and the F4U Corsair, and could be a formidable weapon in the hands of an ace. In February 1945, Ensign Kaneyoshi Muto, flying an N1K2-J as part of a mixed formation of at least ten Japanese aircraft, faced seven U.S. Navy Hellcat pilots from squadron VF-82 in the sky over Japan; the formation shot down four Hellcats with no loss to themselves. After the action, Japanese propagandists fabricated a story in which Muto was the sole airman facing twelve enemy aircraft. (A leading Japanese ace, Saburō Sakai, later asserted in his autobiography that Muto had done this feat at an earlier stage of the war – albeit at the controls of a Zero fighter.)

The N1K1-J aircraft were used very effectively over Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines, and, later, Okinawa. Before production was switched to the improved N1K2-J, 1,007 aircraft, including prototypes, were produced. Because of production difficulties and damage done by B-29 raids on factories, only 415 of the superior N1K2-J fighters were produced.

The N1K2-J &quot;Shiden-Kai&quot; proved to be one of the best dogfighting aircraft produced by either side. Along with high speed, the &quot;Shiden-Kai&quot; offered pilots an agile aircraft with a roll rate of 82°/sec at , backing four powerful 20 mm cannons in the wings. As a bomber interceptor, the N1K2-J fared less well, hampered by a poor rate of climb and reduced engine performance at high altitude.

===343 Kōkūtai===

The N1K2-J &quot;Shiden-Kai&quot; offered a formidable, if demanding, aircraft in limited quantities. As a result, the planes were distributed to elite naval fighter units such as &quot;343 Kōkūtai&quot; (&quot;343rd Naval Air Group&quot;), constituted on 25 December 1944 and commanded by Minoru Genda. The new &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; included some of Japan&#x27;s most experienced fighter pilots, such as Naoshi Kanno and Saburo Sakai. The unit received the best available naval equipment, such as the Nakajima C6N &quot;Saiun&quot;, codenamed &quot;Myrt&quot; long-range reconnaissance aircraft.

On 18 March 1945, one of the &quot;Myrts&quot; spotted U.S. carriers en route to Japan. The following morning, &quot;Shiden&quot; aircraft flown by &quot;343 Kōkūtai&quot; intercepted 300 American aircraft. Many of the &quot;Shiden&quot; forces were N1K2s. When the &quot;Shidens&quot; encountered Grumman F6F Hellcats from USN Fighter Bomber Squadron 17 (VBF-17), three aircraft were lost on both sides in the initial attack: one Hellcat and two &quot;Shiden&quot;s were shot down by enemy ground fire, two fighters collided in mid-air, and one Hellcat crashed while trying to land. Another &quot;Shiden&quot; dived on a Hellcat group and downed another one. Ultimately, the &quot;Hikōtai&quot; lost six fighters versus eight VBF-17 fighters on the other side.
Another noted encounter pitted the N1K against the Vought F4U Corsair; two Corsairs from VBF-10, accidentally separated from their main formations, were attacked by &quot;Shidens&quot; from the 343rd. Four N1K2s were shot down. The Corsairs returned to their carrier, . A second encounter took place when pilots flying &quot;Shiden&quot;s initially mistook Corsairs from Marine Fighter Squadron 123 (VMF-123) for Hellcats and attacked. A 30-minute aerial duel ensued, in which three Corsairs were shot down, and another five were damaged. Three other F4Us returned to their carriers and were so heavily damaged that the planes were scrapped. No &quot;Shiden&quot;s were lost to Corsairs in that aerial battle. Losses for the Japanese N1K pilots occurred in a related action. However, two &quot;Shiden&quot;s were shot down upon return for landing by Hellcats of Fighting Squadron 9 (VF-9). At the same time, many more &quot;Shiden&quot;s were destroyed by American fighters over another airfield where low on fuel, their pilots tried to land. The 343rd claimed 52 kills, and the U.S. squadrons 63. The losses were 15 &quot;Shiden&quot;s and 13 pilots, a &quot;Myrt&quot;, its three-person crew, and nine other Japanese fighters. The U.S. also took heavy losses: 14 fighters and seven pilots, plus 11 attack aircraft. Five days later, an unofficial award was sent to 343rd &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; for the bravery shown on 19 March.

On 12 April 1945, another fierce battle involved the 343rd during the mass kamikaze attack on Kikusui N.2. The Japanese recorded several kills but suffered twelve losses out of thirty-four aircraft. On 4 May, another twenty-four &quot;Shiden&quot;s were sent to Kikusui N.5.

In every encounter with enemy fighters, the &quot;Shiden&quot;, especially the &quot;Kai&quot; version, proved to be a capable dogfighter with a potent combination of firepower, agility, and rugged structure. The premier unit flying the &quot;Shiden&quot;, 343rd &quot;Kōkūtai&quot;, remained operational until overwhelming unit losses obliged the group to stand down. The 343rd was disbanded on 14 August 1945 when the Emperor ordered a surrender.

==Surviving aircraft==

All four surviving &quot;Shiden Kai&quot; aircraft are now displayed in American and Japanese museums, while all three surviving &quot;Kyofu&quot; aircraft are displayed/stored in American museums.

One N1K2-J (s/n 5128, tail code A343-19) is at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

The second N1K2-Ja (s/n 5312), a fighter-bomber variant equipped with wing mounts to carry bombs, is on display in the Air Power gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. This aircraft was displayed outside for many years in a children&#x27;s playground in San Diego, suffering considerable corrosion, and had become seriously deteriorated. In 1959 it was donated to the Museum through the cooperation of the San Diego Squadron of the Air Force Association.

The third example (s/n 5341, tail code A343-35) is owned by the National Air and Space Museum but was restored by the Champlin Fighter Museum at Falcon Field, Mesa, Arizona, in return for the right to display the aircraft at Falcon Field for 10 years after restoration. It currently is on display at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.

The fourth authentic &quot;Shiden-Kai&quot; is displayed in a local museum at Nanreku Misho Koen in Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, Japan. This aircraft is known to be from the 343rd Kōkūtai, as the unit flew sorties in the area, but the tail code is unknown as it was partially restored from a corroded wreck recovered from the sea. After an aerial battle on July 24, 1945, its pilot ditched the aircraft in the waters of the Bungo Channel, but he was never found; by the time of the aircraft&#x27;s recovery from the seabed on July 14, 1979, he could be identified only as one of six pilots from the 343rd squadron who disappeared that day. Photographs of the six—including Takashi Oshibuchi, commander of the 701 &quot;Hikōtai&quot;, and Kaneyoshi Muto—are displayed under the aircraft engine. In 2019, the aircraft was restored to non-flying condition. 

N1K1 Kyōfū (s/n 514) is in storage at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland.

N1K1 Kyōfū (s/n 562) is located on display at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredricksburg, Texas.

N1K1 Kyōfū (s/n 565), formerly displayed at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove, Horsham Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, stored at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. Now being restored by American Aero Services, New Smyrna Beach, Florida, for the American Heritage Museum in Stow, Massachusetts.

<doc id="577356" wikidata="Q2948658" url="?curid=577356" title="Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area">
<text>The Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area, also known as Champaign–Urbana and Urbana–Champaign as well as Chambana (colloquially), is a metropolitan area in east-central Illinois. As defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the metropolitan area has a population of 235,608 as of the 2023 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, which ranks it as the 201st largest metropolitan statistical area in the U.S. The area is anchored by the principal cities of Champaign and Urbana, and is home to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the flagship campus of the University of Illinois system.

 the OMB defines the metropolitan area (officially designated the Champaign–Urbana, IL MSA) to consist of Champaign County, Piatt County, and Ford County. From 2018 to 2023, Ford County was not considered a part of the metropolitan area.
The MSA is part of the larger Champaign–Urbana–Danville Combined Statistical Area, which also includes the Danville micropolitan area, and has a population of 307,260 as of the 2023 estimate.

Journalists frequently treat the metropolitan area as just one city. For example, in 1998, &quot;Newsweek&quot; included the Champaign–Urbana Metropolitan Area in its list of the top ten tech cities outside of Silicon Valley. Champaign–Urbana also ranked as tenth out of the top twenty-five green cities in the United States, in a 2007 survey made by &quot;Country Home&quot; magazine.

==Urban core development==
A number of major developments have significantly changed downtown Champaign since the beginning of the 21st century. Beginning in the 1990s, city government began to aggressively court development, including by investing millions of dollars in public funds into downtown improvements and by offering developers incentives, such as liquor licenses, to pursue projects in the area. The 9-story M2 on Neil project is such an example. The project began in 2007 by taking down the facade of the deteriorated Trevett-Mattis Banking Co. which previously occupied the building site. The facade was retained on the M2 building. Residents first began to lease space in the M2 in the winter of 2009. The M2 includes not just condos for residential occupation, but also retail and office space in its lower floors, a common trend in new developments in the urban core. Across the street, a 9-story Hyatt Place boutique hotel opened in the summer of 2014. In the Campustown area adjoining the University of Illinois, the new 24-story highrise apartment building 309 Green was ostensibly completed in the fall of 2007 but had partial occupancy at least through the fall of 2008. It is tall, making it a full 3 stories higher than the older 21-story Tower at Third, the first contribution to the Urbana–Champaign skyline. The Burnham 310 Project, at 18 stories, which is also taller (in overall height), was finished in the fall of 2008 and includes student luxury apartments and a County Market grocery store. Burnham 310 connects downtown Champaign to Campustown. In 2013–14, four other mixed-use buildings (apartments above commercial) have been built in Campustown, with heights of 26, 13, 8, and 5 stories. On the University of Illinois campus, Memorial Stadium has gone under major renovation, with construction of new stands, clubs, and luxury suites. Across Kirby Avenue, the Assembly Hall, first built in 1963 and renamed the State Farm Center as part of a major renovation begun in 2014, continues to be the home of Illinois basketball and has resumed hosting concerts and other performing arts after renovation was completed in late 2016. In the late 2000s, the restoration of the Champaign County Courthouse bell tower capped the expansion and renovation of Courthouse facilities and provided a striking focal point in downtown Urbana. These, among other developments, have given the Twin Cities a more urban feel.

==Outlying areas==

The outlying parts of the metropolitan area differ from the suburban areas of many other metropolitan areas. Instead of a sprawling suburban skirt that encircles the urban area, the urban area abuts large swaths of farmland, with small to medium-sized villages that originated as farming communities. But, as the willingness of professionals to commute longer distances has increased in recent decades, new residential developments have arisen on their edges, dotting the surrounding landscape. Some of these villages are home to as many as 5,000 residents or more, but most are significantly smaller.
Most of these outlying communities, such as Savoy, Mahomet, St. Joseph, Tolono, and arguably Rantoul and Monticello as well, are dependent on Champaign and Urbana for economic and infrastructure support. Predominantly, these cities and villages lie in Champaign County. These areas are populated to a substantial extent with commuters who work in Champaign or Urbana, but reside outside the two cities. Because higher paid professors, doctors and technology professionals who work for the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, the many clinics and hospitals in town, or in the Research Park, are more likely to maintain cars for commuting longer distances and to afford owner-occupied single-family housing, these areas lacking in mass transit and high-density rental projects often have a higher median household income than Champaign or Urbana.

In addition to residential developments in the surrounding, formerly agricultural communities, residential neighborhoods are also growing up in unincorporated areas within a short radius of the city limits, while the cities themselves are also expanding to annex areas of new development. While the annexed areas benefit from municipal services, developments that are willing to forego city sewer systems, libraries and police protection can enjoy the lower tax rates the surrounding townships levy, as fewer services are provided. Areas currently under construction extend as far as around Rising Road west of I-57 and north and east of Willard Airport. Some of this land is in Champaign Township, while some has been annexed to either Champaign or Savoy. Additional land development is occurring north of I-74 in land annexed by both Champaign and Urbana. On the eastern side of the city of Urbana, new business developments such as a Meijer, a planned Menards, and a commercial center with many restaurants and services have broken ground, as well as more suburban housing.

The issue of land development is often hotly contested by local governments. In addition to arguments for and against development, the question of potential annexations, which remove property tax revenues from the surrounding townships while increasing the urban tax base (but also the demands on urban services) is a point of constant strife between the cities and the surrounding townships. On the other hand, the availability of higher-valued housing in areas belonging to the townships or surrounding villages, which is paid for by workers earning their money within the urban infrastructure also represents a movement of potential tax dollars from Champaign and Urbana to their dependent areas.

==Health==
The Champaign-Urbana Metro area has two hospitals located less than a mile apart near University Avenue in Urbana. The Carle Foundation Hospital, and OSF Heart of Mary Medical Center, with a combined total of over 550 physicians. Both hospitals provide various specialized services, and Carle Hospital currently has a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a Level I Trauma Center, and a medical helicopter service. Both hospitals have struggled to maintain their tax-exempt status with the State of Illinois.

Carle Clinic Association was purchased by the Carle Foundation in 2010. It was renamed Carle Foundation Physician Services, and it maintains several locations next to the hospital, as well as other locations within Champaign-Urbana and other East Central Illinois cities. Christie Clinic, another smaller multi-specialty group practice, is headquartered in downtown Champaign. They are largely affiliated with OSF, but not as closely linked as their Carle counterparts are.

Both hospitals and clinics are affiliated with the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana, part of the larger University of Illinois College of Medicine, which has campuses in Chicago, Peoria, Rockford, and Urbana. The college has a teaching presence at both hospitals, although the facilities are somewhat more extensive at Carle Foundation Hospital.

Piatt County, which is included in the Champaign-Urbana Metro Area, also has a hospital. Kirby Medical Center is a general medical and surgical facility located in Monticello. Both Carle Clinic and Christie Clinic have satellite facilities located at Kirby.

==Arts and culture==
The Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area is home to many theaters. The University is home to three theater venues; Foellinger Auditorium, the State Farm Center and the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. While the State Farm Center is primarily a campus basketball and concert arena, the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts is considered to be one of the nation&#x27;s top venues for performance and hosts over 400 performances annually. Built in 1969, the Krannert Center&#x27;s facilities cover over four acres (16,000 m2) of land, and features four theatres and an amphitheatre.

The Historic Virginia Theatre in downtown Champaign is a public venue owned by the Champaign Park District. It is best known for hosting Roger Ebert&#x27;s which occurs annually during the last week of April. The Virginia also features a variety of performances from community theatre with the Champaign Urbana Theatre Company, to post box office showings of popular films, current artistic films, live musical performances (both orchestral and popular), and other types of shows. First commissioned in 1921, it originally served as a venue for both film and live performances, but became primarily a movie house in the 1950s. Occasional live events were held during the 1970s and 1980s, including a live production of &quot;Oh, Calcutta&quot; and performances by George Benson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Missing Persons, and the Indigo Girls. GKC Corporation closed the Virginia as a movie house on February 13, 1992, with the final regular film being Steve Martin&#x27;s &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. The theatre once again began holding regular live performances when it was leased to local gospel singer David Wyper in 1992. The Champaign-Urbana Theatre Company was formed to perform major musicals and opened their first season with &quot;The Music Man&quot; that June. Control passed to the Virginia Theatre group in 1996 and the theater became a nonprofit public venue. The Champaign Park District assumed control of the facilities in 2000. Its original Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ has been maintained by Warren York since 1988 and is still played regularly.

The Art Theater in downtown Champaign began as Champaign&#x27;s first theatre devoted to movies, the Park, in 1913, and was a small venue showing films not normally playing at the box office. The theatre was the only single-screen movie theatre with daily operation as a movie theatre in Champaign-Urbana. The theater ceased operations on October 31 of 2019. The Virginia, which hosts Roger Ebert&#x27;s Annual Overlooked Film Festival, is also single-screen, but only opens for special showings and events. Rapp and Rapp&#x27;s 1914 Orpheum Theatre closed in the mid-1980s and now houses a children&#x27;s science museum.
Parkland College in Champaign features a small theatre called the Parkland College Theatre and a planetarium called the William M. Staerkel Planetarium.

The area has originated a great deal of musical talent, including REO Speedwagon, Head East, Dan Fogelberg, and Alison Krauss, as well as HUM, Starcastle, Poster Children, Hardvark, The Moon Seven Times, Braid, AMASONG, Castor, National Skyline, Love Cup, Absinthe Blind, Headlights, American Football, and The Beauty Shop. Some lesser known artists like Alma Afrobeat Ensemble, Zirafa and Spinnerty, d-Lo, Bozak, Melodic Scribes, DJ Librarian, UC Hiphop, and Zmick are also worthy of note on simply a local scale. Champaign-Urbana is relatively well known for producing a rich array of emo, college rock, and black metal.

The cities now host Pygmalion Music Festival on an annual basis, presented by the Nicodemus Agency and Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. Past performers include Iron and Wine, The Books, Yacht, Rjd2, Yo La Tengo, Black Mountain, Asobi Seksu, Times New Viking, of Montreal, Danielson, Man Man, Okkervil River, Andrew Bird, Questlove, and more. The 2010 festival took place September 22–25.

The twin cities have a large number and variety of restaurants from long-standing breakfast and pizza traditions to newer, high-end dinner spots with &quot;Chicago-style&quot; aspirations. There is a wide representation of cuisines as well as many vegetarian and vegan choices. This has led to state-wide, mentioned on &quot;Best of Illinois&quot; lists, and regional recognition, receiving the Midwest Living magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Greatest Food Town&#x27; award in 2017

==Media==
*Besides many print outlets, commercial radio stations, and TV stations, Champaign-Urbana has several academic, homegrown and not-for-profit media outlets.
*WEFT 90.1 FM is a community radio station begun by a group of radio enthusiasts, artists, and community-minded individuals working together to realize the potential of bringing a variety of programming and people together behind one frequency. Since 1981, WEFT has broadcast music from around the world and East Central Illinois, news, and public affairs on shows hosted by an all-volunteer staff of air shifters. It also airs programming from national sources including Pacifica Radio.
*WRFU-LP is a low power community radio station owned and operated by Radio Free Urbana. The station was built by hundreds of volunteers from the region and around the country in November 2005 at the ninth Prometheus Radio Project barnraising. WRFU broadcasts music, news, public affairs, and political activism (usually left-leaning) to listeners at 104.5FM.
*Illini Media, located at 5th and Green in campustown, is home to the college&#x27;s alternative radio station WPGU 107.1. The Illini Media Building is also home to the Daily Illini, the student-run daily newspaper, and Buzz Weekly which has quickly become a popular source for arts &amp; entertainment news in the Champaign-Urbana area.
*Smile Politely, an online magazine focused on arts, entertainment and alternative news, opened in 2007 and is seen as the successor to previous print efforts like The Octopus, and The Hub Weekly.

==Transportation==
In 2009, the Champaign-Urbana metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the fourth highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who walked to work (9 percent). In 2013, the Champaign-Urbana MSA ranked as the eleventh lowest in the United States for percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (78.4 percent).

U.S. Routes 45 and 150 pass through the cities as well, and Illinois Routes 10 and 130 originate in Champaign and Urbana, respectively.

The Champaign-Urbana area is served by the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District, which has its main interchange at Illinois Terminal. While primarily serving Rantoul and Danville respectively, Champaign County Area Rural Transit System and Danville Mass Transit also provide connecting service to the Illinois Terminal. Illinois Terminal also provides service by Greyhound Lines, Burlington Trailways, and the Amtrak City of New Orleans, &quot;Illini&quot; and &quot;Saluki&quot; routes, making it a regional transportation hub.

The University of Illinois Willard Airport in Savoy on the south side of Champaign provides air service through American Eagle.

==Sports==
While greater Champaign-Urbana does not feature any professional sports teams, the University of Illinois fields many teams which compete in the Big Ten Conference. Memorial Stadium and the State Farm Center (formerly the Assembly Hall) are both located in the south-east portion of Champaign. Memorial Stadium is a football arena where the Fighting Illini football team plays, and the State Farm Center is the home of the highly successful Fighting Illini basketball team. The NFL&#x27;s Chicago Bears played in Memorial Stadium for the 2002 season while Soldier Field was being modernized and refurbished.

The city of Champaign has been working with the Frontier League to create a privately owned professional baseball team. The team was scheduled to start playing in the 2009 baseball season, but was delayed in 2008 to the 2010 season at the earliest. Since then however, there has been no development on the matter.

The University of Illinois hosted the 2013 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Tennis Championships in May at the Kahn Outdoor Tennis Complex next to the Atkins Tennis Center and Eichelberger Field just south of Florida Avenue in Urbana.

<text>The Royal Canadian Legion is a non-profit Canadian veterans&#x27; organization founded in 1925. Members include people who served in the military, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, provincial or municipal police, Royal Canadian Air, Army and Sea Cadets and direct relatives.

==History==
In Canada, several veterans&#x27; organizations emerged after the First World War. The Great War Veterans Association was the largest of 15. Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, founder of the British Empire Service League (now known as the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League), visited Canada in 1925 and urged them to merge. That year, the Dominion Veterans Alliance served this purpose.

In November 1925, the Canadian Legion was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba, as the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Services League, incorporated by a 1926 special Act of Parliament. It grew steadily through the 1930s, then expanded rapidly following the Second World War. In 1960, Queen Elizabeth II granted it royal patronage and so it became the Royal Canadian Legion.

==Recognition==
On 10 November 1975, Canada Post issued &quot;The Royal Canadian Legion, 1925–1975&quot; designed by Rudy Kovach. The 8¢ stamps are perforated 13 and were printed by British American Bank Note Company.

==National Headquarters==
The National Headquarters of The Royal Canadian Legion in Ottawa, Ontario, feature a Wall of Remembrance, adorned by a three-metre long stainless steel sword (2006) by André Gauthier, who also provided a small work of art on the theme of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (2001) and “Of Such as These” (2003), a small bas-relief of Canadian World War II soldiers, presented by the Conference of Defence Associations Institute to Legion&#x27;s National Secretariat.

==Memorials==
The Royal Canadian Legion Branch 593 erected a memorial in Ottawa dedicated to those who died in the First and Second World Wars and the Korean War.

==Museums==

A number of military museums are co-located and affiliated with Royal Canadian Legions.
== Halls ==

Most small towns and villages in Canada have at least one Legion Hall. Often the Legion Hall is a major community centre, combining the functions of a pub, pool hall, dance hall, bingo hall, banquet hall, and so on.

Legion Halls are numbered, for example &quot;Branch 99 Royal Canadian Legion&quot;. This is not a nationwide numbering system; instead, each provincial Command has its own numerical sequence. &quot;Branch 99&quot;, therefore, can refer to any of several Legion Halls, as follows: Belleville, Ontario; Cowansville, Quebec; Lipton/Dysart, Saskatchewan; Coronation, Alberta (a branch that has closed); Sicamous, British Columbia; or Emo, Ontario (in the Manitoba/Northwestern Ontario Command).

The Royal Canadian Legion Maple Leaf Post-84 is located in Royal Oak, Michigan.

==Services and activities==

===Poppy campaign===
The poppy is a powerful symbol associated in Canada with loss, sacrifice and remembrance. With the formation of the Legion in 1925 the poppy was adopted as a national symbol of remembrance. In 1948, the Government of Canada awarded the poppy&#x27;s trademark to the Royal Canadian Legion to protect the image from misuse. This still restricts its usage in Canada to remembrance under the authority of the Royal Canadian Legion.

The Legion is responsible for Canada&#x27;s remembrance poppy campaign which distributes plastic lapel poppies to be worn in the lead up to Remembrance Day. The poppy is worn on the left lapel, or as close to the heart as possible. The current lapel poppy has been manufactured since 1922—originally under the sponsorship of the Department of Soldiers Civil Re-establishment. Until 1996, the poppy material was manufactured at sheltered workshops operated by Veterans Affairs Canada. Poppies are distributed through retail outlets, workplaces, Legion branches, malls and other locations across Canada. Typically, the poppies are offered up for donation as a symbol of remembrance, using an honour system, with the poppies being left in open places with a receptacle for leaving a donation toward the campaign. Funds raised are used to support ex-service members in need and to fund medical appliances and research, home services, care facilities and numerous other purposes benefiting veterans.

===Athletic camp===
In 1962, the Legion began a summer sports camp at the International Peace Garden; the camp ran until 2019. More than 60,000 school age athletes. Several sports were offered over a five-week period. The program was founded by George H. Phillips and Fred Taylor.

===Bands===
There are many privately run Legion bands across the country, acting independently and in the community in which they are based. They are attached to different legion branches and include full concert show bands, and marching bands. The Royal Canadian Legion Concert Band in Toronto has been active for over a century and is one of the oldest legion bands in the country. Many legion bands were led by former bandsmen, most notably James Gayfer, director of the Band of the Canadian Guards from 1953 to 1961, who founded the Petawawa Legion Community Band in 1978. In May 1978, legion bands congregated at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal for the Legion Day celebrations, becoming one of the largest legion combined activities recorded.

===Lest We Forget Project===
The Legion supports the Lest We Forget Project in cooperation with the Canadian War Museum.

===Military skills conversion===
In 2015, the Royal Canadian Legion donated $830,000 to the BCIT School of Business to fund the Legion Military Skills Conversion Program. This program helps Canadian veterans and reservists convert their military skills and knowledge into a business credential.

The Royal Canadian Legion provides assistance to veterans and eligible family members before the Veterans Review and Appeal Board. The RCL and the Bureau of Pensions Advocates often work together to prepare cases and represent veteran clients before the board when those clients wish to appeal disability pension and award decisions made by Veterans Affairs Canada.

==Membership==

Membership in The Royal Canadian Legion was originally restricted to ex-service members of Canada&#x27;s Armed Forces and Merchant Navy. The organization is now open to members of the general public. There are four categories of membership.

===Ordinary===
Ordinary membership is open to anyone who has served or is serving in one of the following:
*The Canadian Forces or His Majesty&#x27;s Forces (including regular force or reserve force under class &quot;C&quot; service, CIC, or other reserve).
*Forces or underground forces of any of His Majesty&#x27;s allies in any war, conflict or police action in which Canada was involved.
*The Merchant Navy or non-military services in an actual theatre of war in which Canada was involved.
*His Majesty&#x27;s reserve forces including Cadet Instructors on the Cadet Cadre for not less than one year.
*The Royal Canadian Mounted Police or The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary for not less than one year.
*The forces of a country while that country was a member of NATO or NORAD in alliance with Canada.
*The forces of the United States.
*The Vietnam War with the Armed Forces of the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea or South Vietnam, and were a Canadian citizen or Commonwealth subject at the time of service.
*The Canadian Coast Guard as an officer or crew member who has two or more years active service on the high seas or inland waterways.
*A city, municipal or provincial police force as a police officer for not less than one year.

===Associate===
Individuals who do not qualify for ordinary membership can be associate members if one of the following applies:
*The Royal Canadian Air, Army or Sea cadets for no less than 3 years of the joined date. (Cadet graduates may also be eligible for their first year free.)

<doc id="577366" wikidata="Q537618" url="?curid=577366" title="Banach–Alaoglu theorem">
<text>In functional analysis and related branches of mathematics, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem (also known as Alaoglu&#x27;s theorem) states that the closed unit ball of the dual space of a normed vector space is compact in the weak* topology. 
A common proof identifies the unit ball with the weak-* topology as a closed subset of a product of compact sets with the product topology. 
As a consequence of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, this product, and hence the unit ball within, is compact.

This theorem has applications in physics when one describes the set of states of an algebra of observables, namely that any state can be written as a convex linear combination of so-called pure states.

==History==

According to Lawrence Narici and Edward Beckenstein, the Alaoglu theorem is a “very important result—maybe most important fact about the weak-* topology—[that] echos throughout functional analysis.” 
In 1912, Helly proved that the unit ball of the continuous dual space of formula_1 is countably weak-* compact. 
In 1932, Stefan Banach proved that the closed unit ball in the continuous dual space of any separable normed space is sequentially weak-* compact (Banach only considered sequential compactness). 
The proof for the general case was published in 1940 by the mathematician Leonidas Alaoglu. 
According to Pietsch [2007], there are at least twelve mathematicians who can lay claim to this theorem or an important predecessor to it. 

The Bourbaki–Alaoglu theorem is a generalization of the original theorem by Bourbaki to dual topologies on locally convex spaces. 
This theorem is also called the Banach–Alaoglu theorem or the weak-* compactness theorem and it is commonly called simply the Alaoglu theorem.

==Statement==
If formula_2 is a vector space over the field formula_3 then formula_4 will denote the algebraic dual space of formula_2 and these two spaces are henceforth associated with the bilinear formula_6 defined by 
formula_7
where the triple formula_8 forms a dual system called the . 

If formula_2 is a topological vector space (TVS) then its continuous dual space will be denoted by formula_10 where formula_11 always holds. 
Denote the weak-* topology on formula_4 by formula_13 and denote the weak-* topology on formula_14 by formula_15 
The weak-* topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence because given a map formula_16 and a net of maps formula_17 the net formula_18 converges to formula_16 in this topology if and only if for every point formula_20 in the domain, the net of values formula_21 converges to the value formula_22 

===Proof involving duality theory===

 |f(x)|\leq 1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt; be the bipolar of formula_23 with respect to formula_24;
* formula_25 be the polar of formula_23 with respect to the canonical dual system formula_27 Note that formula_28
A well known fact about polar sets is that formula_29 

# Show that formula_30 is a formula_13-closed subset of formula_32 Let formula_33 and suppose that formula_34 is a net in formula_30 that converges to formula_16 in formula_37 To conclude that formula_38 it is sufficient (and necessary) to show that formula_39 for every formula_40 Because formula_41 in the scalar field formula_3 and every value formula_43 belongs to the closed (in formula_3) subset formula_45 so too must this net&#x27;s limit formula_46 belong to this set. Thus formula_47 
# Show that formula_48 and then conclude that formula_49 is a closed subset of both formula_50 and formula_51 The inclusion formula_52 holds because every continuous linear functional is (in particular) a linear functional. For the reverse inclusion formula_53 let formula_54 so that formula_55 which states exactly that the linear functional formula_16 is bounded on the neighborhood formula_23; thus formula_16 is a continuous linear functional (that is, formula_59) and so formula_60 as desired. Using (1) and the fact that the intersection formula_61 is closed in the subspace topology on formula_10 the claim about formula_49 being closed follows. 
# Show that formula_49 is a formula_65-totally bounded subset of formula_66 By the bipolar theorem, formula_67 where because the neighborhood formula_23 is an absorbing subset of formula_69 the same must be true of the set formula_70 it is possible to prove that this implies that formula_49 is a formula_65-bounded subset of formula_73 Because formula_2 distinguishes points of formula_10 a subset of formula_14 is formula_65-bounded if and only if it is formula_65-totally bounded. So in particular, formula_49 is also formula_65-totally bounded. 
# Conclude that formula_49 is also a formula_13-totally bounded subset of formula_32 Recall that the formula_65 topology on formula_14 is identical to the subspace topology that formula_14 inherits from formula_37 This fact, together with (3) and the definition of &quot;totally bounded&quot;, implies that formula_49 is a formula_13-totally bounded subset of formula_90 
# Finally, deduce that formula_49 is a formula_65-compact subset of formula_66 Because formula_50 is a complete TVS and formula_49 is a closed (by (2)) and totally bounded (by (4)) subset of formula_96 it follows that formula_49 is compact. formula_98

If formula_2 is a normed vector space, then the polar of a neighborhood is closed and norm-bounded in the dual space. 
In particular, if formula_23 is the open (or closed) unit ball in formula_2 then the polar of formula_23 is the closed unit ball in the continuous dual space formula_14 of formula_2 (with the usual dual norm). 
Consequently, this theorem can be specialized to:

When the continuous dual space formula_14 of formula_2 is an infinite dimensional normed space then it is for the closed unit ball in formula_14 to be a compact subset when formula_14 has its usual norm topology. 
This is because the unit ball in the norm topology is compact if and only if the space is finite-dimensional (cf. F. Riesz theorem). 
This theorem is one example of the utility of having different topologies on the same vector space.

It should be cautioned that despite appearances, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem does imply that the weak-* topology is locally compact. 
This is because the closed unit ball is only a neighborhood of the origin in the strong topology, but is usually not a neighborhood of the origin in the weak-* topology, as it has empty interior in the weak* topology, unless the space is finite-dimensional. 
In fact, it is a result of Weil that all locally compact Hausdorff topological vector spaces must be finite-dimensional.

===Elementary proof===

The following elementary proof does not utilize duality theory and requires only basic concepts from set theory, topology, and functional analysis. 
What is needed from topology is a working knowledge of net convergence in topological spaces and familiarity with the fact that a linear functional is continuous if and only if it is bounded on a neighborhood of the origin (see the articles on continuous linear functionals and sublinear functionals for details). 
Also required is a proper understanding of the technical details of how the space formula_109 of all functions of the form formula_110 is identified as the Cartesian product formula_111 and the relationship between pointwise convergence, the product topology, and subspace topologies they induce on subsets such as the algebraic dual space formula_4 and products of subspaces such as formula_113 
An explanation of these details is now given for readers who are interested. 

For every real formula_114 formula_115 will denote the closed ball of radius formula_116 centered at formula_117 and formula_118 for any formula_119

Identification of functions with tuples

The Cartesian product formula_120 is usually thought of as the set of all formula_2-indexed tuples formula_122 but, since tuples are technically just functions from an indexing set, it can also be identified with the space formula_109 of all functions having prototype formula_124 as is now described: 

* : A function formula_125 belonging to formula_109 is identified with its (formula_2-indexed) &quot;&quot; formula_128
* : A tuple formula_122 in formula_120 is identified with the function formula_125 defined by formula_132; this function&#x27;s &quot;tuple of values&quot; is the original tuple formula_133

This is the reason why many authors write, often without comment, the equality 
formula_134
and why the Cartesian product formula_120 is sometimes taken as the definition of the set of maps formula_109 (or conversely). 
However, the Cartesian product, being the (categorical) product in the category of sets (which is a type of inverse limit), also comes equipped with associated maps that are known as its (coordinate) . 

The at a given point formula_137 is the function
formula_138
where under the above identification, formula_139 sends a function formula_125 to
formula_141 
Stated in words, for a point formula_142 and function formula_143 &quot;plugging formula_142 into formula_145&quot; is the same as &quot;plugging formula_145 into formula_139&quot;. 

In particular, suppose that formula_148 are non-negative real numbers. 
Then formula_149 where under the above identification of tuples with functions, formula_150 is the set of all functions formula_151 such that formula_152 for every formula_153 

If a subset formula_154 partitions formula_2 into formula_156 then the linear bijection
formula_157
canonically identifies these two Cartesian products; moreover, this map is a homeomorphism when these products are endowed with their product topologies. 
In terms of function spaces, this bijection could be expressed as 
formula_158

Notation for nets and function composition with nets

A net formula_159 in formula_2 is by definition a function formula_161 from a non-empty directed set formula_162 
Every sequence in formula_69 which by definition is just a function of the form formula_164 is also a net. 
As with sequences, the value of a net formula_165 at an index formula_166 is denoted by formula_167; however, for this proof, this value formula_167 may also be denoted by the usual function parentheses notation formula_169 
Similarly for function composition, if formula_170 is any function then the net (or sequence) that results from &quot;plugging formula_165 into formula_172&quot; is just the function formula_173 although this is typically denoted by formula_174 (or by formula_175 if formula_165 is a sequence). 
In the proofs below, this resulting net may be denoted by any of the following notations 
formula_177 
depending on whichever notation is cleanest or most clearly communicates the intended information. 
In particular, if formula_170 is continuous and formula_179 in formula_69 then the conclusion commonly written as formula_181 may instead be written as formula_182 or formula_183 

Topology

The set formula_184 is assumed to be endowed with the product topology. It is well known that the product topology is identical to the topology of pointwise convergence. 
This is because given formula_16 and a net formula_186 where formula_16 and every formula_188 is an element of formula_189 then the net formula_190 converges in the product topology if and only if

:for every formula_191 the net formula_192 converges in formula_193 

where because formula_194 and 
formula_195 
this happens if and only if 

:for every formula_191 the net formula_197 converges in formula_193 

Thus formula_199 converges to formula_16 in the product topology if and only if it converges to formula_16 pointwise on formula_202

This proof will also use the fact that the topology of pointwise convergence is preserved when passing to topological subspaces. 
This means, for example, that if for every formula_203 formula_204 is some (topological) subspace of formula_3 then the topology of pointwise convergence (or equivalently, the product topology) on formula_206 is equal to the subspace topology that the set formula_206 inherits from formula_208 
And if formula_209 is closed in formula_3 for every formula_203 then formula_206 is a closed subset of formula_208 

Characterization of formula_214

An important fact used by the proof is that for any real formula_114 
formula_216
where formula_217 denotes the supremum and formula_218 
As a side note, this characterization does not hold if the closed ball formula_219 is replaced with the open ball formula_220 (and replacing formula_221 with the strict inequality formula_222 will not change this; for counter-examples, consider formula_223 and the identity map formula_224 on formula_2). 

The essence of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem can be found in the next proposition, from which the Banach–Alaoglu theorem follows. 
Unlike the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, this proposition does require the vector space formula_2 to endowed with any topology. 

{=}~ \{s \in \mathbb{K} : |s| \leq r\}&lt;/math&gt; with its usual topology (formula_2 need not be endowed with any topology, but formula_3 has its usual Euclidean topology). 
Define
formula_229

If for every formula_203 formula_231 is a real number such that formula_232 then formula_30 is a closed and compact subspace of the product space formula_150 (where because this product topology is identical to the topology of pointwise convergence, which is also called the weak-* topology in functional analysis, this means that formula_30 is compact in the weak-* topology or &quot;weak-* compact&quot; for short).

Before proving the proposition above, it is first shown how the Banach–Alaoglu theorem follows from it (unlike the proposition, Banach–Alaoglu assumes that formula_2 is a topological vector space (TVS) and that formula_23 is a neighborhood of the origin). 

{=}~ \Big\{f \in (X, \sigma)^{\prime} ~:~ \sup_{u \in U} |f(u)| \leq 1\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;
so that formula_238 is just the set formula_49 from above. 
Then formula_240 because both of these sets are equal to formula_241 Said differently, the polar set formula_242&#x27;s defining &quot;requirement&quot; that formula_242 be a subset of the dual space formula_244 is inconsequential and can be ignored because it does not have any effect on the resulting set of linear functionals. However, if formula_245 is a TVS topology on formula_2 such that formula_23 is a neighborhood of the origin in formula_248 then the polar formula_249 of formula_23 with respect to formula_248 is not guaranteed to equal formula_30 and so the topology formula_245 can not be ignored.&lt;/ref&gt; 
where recall that formula_49 was defined as
formula_255

Proof that formula_256 
Because formula_257 the conclusion is equivalent to formula_258 
If formula_54 then formula_55 which states exactly that the linear functional formula_16 is bounded on the neighborhood formula_262 thus formula_16 is a continuous linear functional (that is, formula_59), as desired. 
formula_98

{=}~ \{s \in \mathbb{K} : |s| \leq r_x\}&lt;/math&gt; is a Hausdorff compact space). Because a closed subset of a compact space is compact, the proof of the proposition will be complete once it is shown that
formula_266
is a closed subset of formula_113 
The following statements guarantee this conclusion:
#formula_268
#formula_30 is a closed subset of the product space formula_270

Proof of (1): 

For any formula_191 let formula_272 denote the projection to the formula_142th coordinate (as defined above). 
To prove that formula_274 it is sufficient (and necessary) to show that formula_275 for every formula_153 
So fix formula_277 and let formula_278 
Because formula_279 it remains to show that formula_280 
Recall that formula_231 was defined in the proposition&#x27;s statement as being any positive real number that satisfies formula_282 (so for example, formula_283 would be a valid choice for each formula_284), which implies formula_285 
Because formula_16 is a positive homogeneous function that satisfies formula_55 
formula_288 

Thus formula_289 which shows that formula_290 as desired. 

Proof of (2): 

The algebraic dual space formula_4 is always a closed subset of formula_184 (this is proved in the lemma below for readers who are not familiar with this result). 
The set
formula_293
is closed in the product topology on formula_294 since it is a product of closed subsets of formula_295 
Thus formula_296 is an intersection of two closed subsets of formula_297 which proves (2).
formula_98

The conclusion that the set formula_299 is closed can also be reached by applying the following more general result, this time proved using nets, to the special case formula_300 and formula_301

:Observation: If formula_154 is any set and if formula_303 is a closed subset of a topological space formula_304 then formula_305 is a closed subset of formula_306 in the topology of pointwise convergence. 

:Proof of observation: Let formula_307 and suppose that formula_199 is a net in formula_309 that converges pointwise to formula_310 It remains to show that formula_311 which by definition means formula_312 For any formula_313 because formula_314 in formula_315 and every value formula_316 belongs to the closed (in formula_315) subset formula_318 so too must this net&#x27;s limit belong to this closed set; thus formula_319 which completes the proof. formula_98


Let formula_321 and suppose that formula_34 is a net in formula_4 the converges to formula_16 in formula_325 
To conclude that formula_326 it must be shown that formula_16 is a linear functional. So let formula_145 be a scalar and let formula_329 

For any formula_191 let formula_331 denote 
formula_332
Because formula_333 in formula_297 which has the topology of pointwise convergence, formula_335 in formula_3 for every formula_337 
By using formula_338 in place of formula_339 it follows that each of the following nets of scalars converges in formula_340
formula_341
Proof that formula_342 
Let formula_343 be the &quot;multiplication by formula_145&quot; map defined by formula_345 
Because formula_346 is continuous and formula_347 in formula_193 it follows that formula_349 where the right hand side is formula_350 and the left hand side is
formula_351
which proves that formula_352 Because also formula_353 and limits in formula_3 are unique, it follows that formula_355 as desired. 
Proof that formula_356 
Define a net formula_357 by letting formula_358 for every formula_359 
Because formula_360 and formula_361 it follows that formula_362 in formula_363 
Let formula_364 be the addition map defined by formula_365 
The continuity of formula_366 implies that formula_367 in formula_3 where the right hand side is formula_369 and the left hand side is
formula_370
which proves that formula_371 Because also formula_372 it follows that formula_373 as desired. 
formula_98


The lemma above actually also follows from its corollary below since formula_375 is a Hausdorff complete uniform space and any subset of such a space (in particular formula_4) is closed if and only if it is complete. 

Because the underlying field formula_3 is a complete Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space, the same is true of the product space formula_378 
A closed subset of a complete space is complete, so by the lemma, the space formula_50 is complete.
formula_98 

The above elementary proof of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem actually shows that if formula_154 is any subset that satisfies formula_382 (such as any absorbing subset of formula_2), then formula_384 is a weak-* compact subset of formula_90 

As a side note, with the help of the above elementary proof, it may be shown (see this footnote) 
that there exist formula_2-indexed non-negative real numbers formula_387 such that 
formula_388
where these real numbers formula_389 can also be chosen to be &quot;minimal&quot; in the following sense: 
using formula_390 (so formula_391 as in the proof) and defining the notation formula_392 for any formula_393 if
formula_394 
then formula_395 and for every formula_203 formula_397 
which shows that these numbers formula_389 are unique; indeed, this infimum formula can be used to define them. 

In fact, if formula_399 denotes the set of all such products of closed balls containing the polar set formula_400
formula_401 
then 
formula_402 
where formula_403 denotes the intersection of all sets belonging to formula_404

This implies (among other things) 
that formula_405 the unique least element of formula_399 with respect to formula_407 this may be used as an alternative definition of this (necessarily convex and balanced) set. 
The function formula_408 is a seminorm and it is unchanged if formula_23 is replaced by the convex balanced hull of formula_23 (because formula_411). 
Similarly, because formula_412 formula_389 is also unchanged if formula_23 is replaced by its closure in formula_202

==Sequential Banach–Alaoglu theorem==

A special case of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem is the sequential version of the theorem, which asserts that the closed unit ball of the dual space of a separable normed vector space is sequentially compact in the weak-* topology. 
In fact, the weak* topology on the closed unit ball of the dual of a separable space is metrizable, and thus compactness and sequential compactness are equivalent.

Specifically, let formula_2 be a separable normed space and formula_417 the closed unit ball in formula_73 Since formula_2 is separable, let formula_420 be a countable dense subset. 
Then the following defines a metric, where for any formula_421 
formula_422
in which formula_423 denotes the duality pairing of formula_14 with formula_202 
Sequential compactness of formula_417 in this metric can be shown by a diagonalization argument similar to the one employed in the proof of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem.

Due to the constructive nature of its proof (as opposed to the general case, which is based on the axiom of choice), the sequential Banach–Alaoglu theorem is often used in the field of partial differential equations to construct solutions to PDE or variational problems. 
For instance, if one wants to minimize a functional formula_427 on the dual of a separable normed vector space formula_69 one common strategy is to first construct a minimizing sequence formula_429 which approaches the infimum of formula_430 use the sequential Banach–Alaoglu theorem to extract a subsequence that converges in the weak* topology to a limit formula_431 and then establish that formula_20 is a minimizer of formula_433 
The last step often requires formula_172 to obey a (sequential) lower semi-continuity property in the weak* topology.

When formula_14 is the space of finite Radon measures on the real line (so that formula_436 is the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, by the Riesz representation theorem), the sequential Banach–Alaoglu theorem is equivalent to the Helly selection theorem.

==Consequences==

===Consequences for normed spaces===

Assume that formula_2 is a normed space and endow its continuous dual space formula_14 with the usual dual norm. 

===Consequences for Hilbert spaces===

==Relation to the axiom of choice and other statements==
The Banach–Alaoglu may be proven by using Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, which under the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) axiomatic framework is equivalent to the axiom of choice. 
Most mainstream functional analysis relies on ZF + the axiom of choice, which is often denoted by ZFC. 
However, the theorem does rely upon the axiom of choice in the separable case (see above): in this case there actually exists a constructive proof. 
In the general case of an arbitrary normed space, the ultrafilter Lemma, which is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice and equivalent to Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem for compact spaces, suffices for the proof of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, and is in fact equivalent to it.

The Banach–Alaoglu theorem is equivalent to the ultrafilter lemma, which implies the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces (HB) but is not equivalent to it (said differently, Banach–Alaoglu is also strictly stronger than HB). 
However, the Hahn–Banach theorem is equivalent to the following weak version of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem for normed space in which the conclusion of compactness (in the weak-* topology of the closed unit ball of the dual space) is replaced with the conclusion of (also sometimes called ); 

 C&lt;/math&gt; is not empty.

Compactness implies convex compactness because a topological space is compact if and only if every family of closed subsets having the finite intersection property (FIP) has non-empty intersection. 
The definition of convex compactness is similar to this characterization of compact spaces in terms of the FIP, except that it only involves those closed subsets that are also convex (rather than all closed subsets).
