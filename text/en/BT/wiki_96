<text>Lenore &quot;Lee&quot; Krasner (born Lena Krassner; October 27, 1908 – June 19, 1984) was an American painter and visual artist active primarily in New York whose work has been associated with the Abstract Expressionist movement. She received her early academic training at the Women&#x27;s Art School of Cooper Union, and the National Academy of Design from 1928 to 1932. Krasner&#x27;s exposure to Post-Impressionism at the newly opened Museum of Modern Art in 1929 led to a sustained interest in modern art. In 1937, she enrolled in classes taught by Hans Hofmann, which led her to integrate influences of Cubism into her paintings. During the Great Depression, Krasner joined the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Federal Art Project, transitioning to war propaganda artworks during the War Services era.

By the 1940s, Krasner was an established figure among the American abstract artists of the New York School, with a network including painters such as Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko. However, Krasner&#x27;s career was often overshadowed by that of her husband, Jackson Pollock, whom she married in 1945. Their life was marred by Pollock&#x27;s infidelity and alcoholism, while his untimely death in a drunk-driving incident in 1956 had a deep emotional impact on Krasner. The late 1950s to the early 1960s in Krasner&#x27;s work were characterized by a more expressive and gestural style. In her later years, she received broader artistic and commercial recognition and shifted toward large horizontal paintings marked by hard-edge lines and bright contrasting colors.

During her life, Krasner received numerous honorary degrees, including Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Stony Brook University. Following Krasner&#x27;s death in 1984, critic Robert Hughes described her as &quot;the Mother Courage of Abstract Expressionism&quot; and a posthumous retrospective exhibition of her work was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center in Springs, New York and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation were established to preserve the work and cultural influence of her and her husband. The latter has since focused on supporting new artists and art historical scholarship in American art.

==Early life==
Krasner was born as Lena Krassner (outside the family she was known as Lenore Krasner) on October 27, 1908, in Brooklyn, New York. She was the daughter of Chane (née Weiss) and Joseph Krasner, Russian-Jewish immigrants from Spykov 
(now Shpykiv, a Jewish community in what is now Ukraine). Krasner&#x27;s parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants who fled to the United States to escape antisemitism and the Russo-Japanese War, and Chane changed her name to Anna once she arrived. Lee was the youngest of six children, and the only one to be born in the United States.

==Education==

From an early age, Krasner knew she wanted to pursue art as a career. Her career as an artist began when she was a teenager. She specifically sought out enrollment at Washington Irving High School for Girls as they offered an art major. After graduating, she attended the Women&#x27;s Art School of Cooper Union on a scholarship. There, she completed the course work required for a teaching certificate in art. Krasner pursued yet more art education at the National Academy of Design in 1928, completing her course load there in 1932. When Krasner attended high school, she almost didn&#x27;t graduate based on her grade in art, which was the subject she attended the school for, and was only given 65 to pass the class.

By attending a technical art school, Krasner was able to gain an extensive and thorough artistic education as illustrated through her knowledge of the techniques of the Old Masters. She also became highly skilled in portraying anatomically correct figures. There are relatively few works that survive from this time period apart from a few self-portraits and still lifes because most of the works were burned in a fire. One image that still exists from this period is her &quot;Self Portrait&quot; painted in 1930, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She submitted it to the National Academy in order to enroll in a certain class, but the judges could not believe that the young artist produced a self-portrait en plein air. In it, Krasner depicts herself with a defiant expression surrounded by nature. She also briefly enrolled in the Art Students League of New York in 1928. There, she took a class led by George Bridgman who emphasized the human form.

Krasner was highly influenced by the opening of the Museum of Modern Art in 1929. She was very affected by Post-Impressionism and grew critical of the academic notions of style she had learned at the National Academy. In the 1930s, she began studying modern art through learning the components of composition, technique, and theory. She began taking classes from Hans Hofmann in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and still life. He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the picture plane and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons. Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human nude or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings. She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.

Hans Hofmann &quot;was very negative&quot; his former student said &quot;but one day he stood before my easel and he gave me the first praise I had ever received as an artist from him. He said, &#x27;This is so good, you would never know it was done by a woman&quot;. She also received praise from Piet Mondrian who once told her &quot;You have a very strong inner rhythm; you must never lose it.&quot;

==Early career==

Krasner supported herself as a waitress during her studies but it eventually became too difficult due to the Great Depression. In 1935 to continue providing for herself she joined the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Federal Art Project, working in the mural division as an assistant to Max Spivak. Her job was to enlarge other artists&#x27; designs for large-scaled public murals. Murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public; however, the abstract art Krasner produced did not meet this need. Although happy to be employed, she was dissatisfied because she did not enjoy working with the figurative images created by other artists. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an abstract mural. Soon after one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the WNYC radio station, the Works Progress Administration became War Services and all art had to be created for war propaganda. Krasner continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort that were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan. She was intensively involved with the Artists Union during her employment with the WPA but was one of the first to quit when she realized the communists were taking it over. However, by being part of this organization she was able to meet more artists in the city and enlarge her network.

She joined the American Abstract Artists in 1940. While a member, she typically exhibited cubist still life in a black-gridded cloisonne style that was highly impastoed and gestural. She met future abstract expressionists Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, and Bradley Walker Tomlin through this organization. However, she lost interest in their usage of hard-edge geometric style after beginning her relationship with Jackson Pollock.

==Career==
Krasner is identified as an abstract expressionist due to her abstract, gestural, and expressive works in painting, collage painting, charcoal drawing, and occasionally mosaics. She would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create her collage paintings. She also commonly revised or completely destroyed an entire series of works due to her critical nature; as a result, her surviving body of work is relatively small. Her catalogue raisonné, published in 1995 by Abrams, lists 599 known pieces.

Her changeable nature is reflected throughout her work, which has led critics and scholars to have different conclusions about her and her oeuvre. Krasner&#x27;s style often alternates between classic structure and baroque action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and monochrome palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often. By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction. Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery. Krasner&#x27;s interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works. She was often reluctant to discuss the iconography of her work and instead emphasized the importance of her biography since she claimed her art was formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.

=== Early 1940s ===
Throughout the first half of the 1940s, Krasner struggled with creating art that satisfied her critical nature. Throughout the 1930s the New York painting scene consisted of a very intimate group of artists that studied each other&#x27;s efforts but was not yet shown in galleries. The 1940s marked a transition from an &quot;age of innocence&quot; to a modernist mindset of pure expression. She was highly affected by seeing Pollock&#x27;s work for the first time in 1942, causing her to reject Hofmann&#x27;s cubist style which required working from a human or still life model. She called the work produced during this frustrating time her &quot;grey slab paintings.&quot; She would create these paintings by working on a canvas for months, overpainting, scraping or rubbing paint off, and adding more pigment until the canvas was nearly monochrome from so much paint buildup. She eventually would destroy these works, which is the reason there is only one painting that exists from this time period. Krasner&#x27;s extensive knowledge of cubism was the source of her creative problem since she needed her work to be more expressive and gestural to be considered contemporary and relevant. In the fall of 1945, Krasner destroyed many of her cubist works she created during her studies with Hofmann, although the majority of paintings created from 1938 to 1943 survived this reevaluation.

===&quot;Little Images:&quot; 1946–1949===

Beginning in 1946, Krasner began working on her &quot;Little Image&quot; series. Commonly categorized as mosaic, webbed, or hieroglyphs depending on the style of the image, these types of paintings, totalling around 40, she created until 1949. The mosaic images were created through the thick buildup of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close to the surface of the canvas. Since Krasner used a drip technique, many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she was reinterpreting Pollock&#x27;s chaotic paint splatters. Her hieroglyph paintings are gridded and look like an unreadable, personal script of Krasner&#x27;s creation. These works demonstrate her anti-figurative concerns, allover approach to the canvas, gestural brushwork, and disregard of naturalistic color. They have little variation of hue but are very rich in texture due to the buildup of impasto and also suggest space continuing beyond the canvas. These are considered her first successful images that she created while working from her own imagination rather than a model. The relatively small scale of the images can be attributed to the fact she painted them on an easel in her small studio space in an upstairs bedroom at The Springs.

Many scholars interpret these images as Krasner&#x27;s reworking of Hebrew script. In an interview later in her career, Krasner admitted to subconsciously working from right to left on her canvases, leading scholars to believe that her ethnic and cultural background affected the rendering of her work. Some scholars have interpreted these paintings to represent the artist&#x27;s reaction to the tragedy of the Holocaust. Others have claimed that Krasner&#x27;s work with the War Services project caused her to be interested in text and codes since cryptoanalysis was a main concern for winning the war.

When she completed the &quot;Little Image&quot; series in 1949, Krasner again went through a critical phase with her work. She tried out and rejected many new styles and eventually destroyed most of the work she made in the early 1950s. There is evidence that she began experimenting with automatic painting and created black-and-white, hybridized, monstrous figures on large canvases in 1950. These were the paintings that Betty Parsons saw when she visited The Springs that summer, causing the gallerist to offer Krasner a show in the fall. Between the summer and the fall, Krasner again had shifted her style to color field painting and destroyed the figurative automatic paintings she made. The Betty Parsons show was Krasner&#x27;s first solo exhibition since 1945. After the exhibition, Krasner used the color field paintings to make her collage paintings.

===Early collage images: 1951–1955===

By 1951, Krasner had started her first series of collage paintings. To create them, Krasner pasted cut-and-torn shapes onto all but two of the large-scale color field paintings she created for the Betty Parsons exhibition in 1951. This period marks the time when the artist stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor. To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired. Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism. By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat. The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner&#x27;s expression since these acts are aggressive. She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through this work. These collage paintings represent Krasner&#x27;s turn away from nonobjective abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.

From 1951 to 1953, most of her works were made from ripped drawings completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, the edges of the figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works. From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller-sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works. Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used her partner&#x27;s unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage form. Others believe that she was creating a sense of intimacy between themselves, which was lacking in their actual relationship by this time period, by combining their works together. By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either masonite, wood, or canvas. These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the Stable Gallery in 1955 in New York City, but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from Clement Greenberg.

===&quot;Earth Green Series:&quot; 1956–1959===

During the summer of 1956, Krasner started her &quot;Earth Green Series.&quot; While she started making this work before Pollock&#x27;s death, they are considered to reflect her feelings of anger, guilt, pain, and loss she experienced about their relationship before and after he died. The intense emotion she felt during this time caused her art to develop along more liberated lines of her self-expression and pushed the boundaries of conventional, developed concepts of art. Through these large-scale action paintings, Krasner depicts hybridized figures that are made up of organic plant-like forms and anatomical parts, which often allude to both male and female body parts. These forms dominate the canvas, causing it to be crowded and densely-packed with bursting and bulging shapes. The pain she experienced during this period is illustrated through the principal usage of flesh tones with blood-red accents in the figures which suggest wounds. The paint drips on her canvas show her speed and willingness to relinquish absolute control, both necessary for portraying her emotions.

By 1957, Krasner continued to create figurative abstract forms in her work, but they suggest more floral elements rather than anatomical. She used brighter colors which were more vibrant and commonly contrasted other colors in the composition. She also would dilute paint or use a dry brush to make the colors more transparent.

In 1958, Krasner was commissioned to create two abstract murals for an office building at 2 Broadway in Manhattan. According to the American art historian Barbara Rose, working on the collage maquettes in preparation for the murals provided Krasner &quot;with a means of translating her winged, floral, and organic forms into monumental abstractions on a public scale&quot;.

===&quot;Umber Series:&quot; 1959–1961===

Krasner&#x27;s &quot;Umber Series&quot; paintings were created during a time when the artist was suffering from insomnia. Since she was working during the night, she had to paint with artificial light rather than daylight, causing her palette to shift from bright, vibrant hues to dull, monochrome colors. She also was still dealing with the death of Pollock and the recent death of her mother, which led her to use an aggressive style when creating these images. These mural-sized action paintings contrast dark and light severely since white, grays, black, and brown are the predominant colors used. Evidence of her animated brushwork can be seen through the drips and splatters of paint on the canvas. There is no central spot for the viewer to focus on in these works, making the composition highly dynamic and rhythmic. To paint on such a large scale, Krasner would tack the canvas to a wall. These images no longer implied organic forms but instead are often interpreted as violent and turbulent landscapes.

===&quot;Primary Series:&quot; 1960s===
By 1962, she begins using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes. These works are compositionally similar to her monochrome images due to their large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point. Their palettes often contrast with one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants. She continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963. Since she still wanted to work, she began painting with her left hand. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained.

After recovering from her broken arm, Krasner began working on bright and decorative allover painting which are less aggressive than her &quot;Earth Green&quot; and Umber Series paintings. Often, these images recall calligraphy or floral ornamentation not blatantly related to Krasner&#x27;s known emotional state. Floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas, connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern.

By the second half of the 1960s, critics began reassessing Krasner&#x27;s role in the New York School as a painter and critic who greatly influenced Pollock and Greenberg. Prior to this, her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with Pollock. Since he served as such a large figure in the abstract expressionist movement, it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning Pollock in some capacity. This reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in London at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1965. This exhibition was more well-received by critics in comparison to her previous shows in New York.

In 1969, Krasner mostly concentrated on creating works on paper with gouache. These works were named either &quot;Earth, Water, Seed,&quot; or &quot;Hieroglyphics&quot; and often looked similar to a Rorschach test. Some scholars claim that these images were a critique of Greenberg&#x27;s theory about the importance of the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.

===Late career===

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the painter&#x27;s work was significantly influenced by postmodern art and emphasized the inherent problems of art as a form of communication.

Starting in 1970, Krasner began making large horizontal paintings made up of hard-edge lines and a palette of a few bright colors that contrasted one another. She painted in this style until about 1973. Three years later, she started working on her second series of collage images. She began working on these after cleaning out her studio and discovered some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940. After saving a few, Krasner decided to use the rest in a new series of collages. In this work, the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint. The hard-edged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into curvilinear shapes that recall floral patterns. Texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas. Since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged without consideration of their original intention or message, the differences between the old drawings and new structures are highly exaggerated. All of the collages&#x27; titles from this series are different verb tenses interpreted as a critique of Greenberg&#x27;s and Michael Fried&#x27;s insistence on the presentness of modern art. This series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the Pace Gallery. It is also considered a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older.

===Krasner and Pollock&#x27;s mutual influence on one another===
Although many people believe that Krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock&#x27;s home life and career, she never in fact stopped creating art. While their relationship developed, she shifted her focus from her own to Pollock&#x27;s art in order to help him gain more recognition due to the fact that she believed that he had &quot;much more to give with his art than she had with hers&quot;.

Throughout her career, Krasner went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of this self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Krasner and Pollock both had an immense effect on each other&#x27;s artistic styles and careers. Since Krasner had learned from Hans Hofmann while Pollock received training from Thomas Hart Benton, each took different approaches to their work. Krasner learned from Hofmann the importance of the abstracting from nature and emphasizing the flat nature of the canvas while Pollock&#x27;s training highlighted the importance of complex design from automatic drawing. Krasner&#x27;s extensive knowledge of modern art helped Pollock since she brought him up to date with what contemporary art should be. He was therefore able to make works that were more organized and cosmopolitan. Additionally, Krasner was responsible for introducing Pollock to many artists, collectors, and critics who appreciated abstract art such as Willem de Kooning, Peggy Guggenheim, and Clement Greenberg. Through her friendship with collector and artist Alfonso Ossorio, Pollock also became acquainted with Ossorio and Joseph Glasco. Pollock helped Krasner become less restrained when making her work. He inspired her to stop painting from human and still life models in order to free her interior emotions and become more spontaneous and gestural through her work.

Krasner struggled with the public&#x27;s reception of her identity, both as a woman and as Pollock&#x27;s wife. When they both exhibited in a show called &quot;Artists: Man and Wife&quot; in 1949, an &quot;ARTnews&quot; reviewer stated: &quot;There is a tendency among some of these wives to &#x27;tidy up&#x27; their husband&#x27;s styles. Lee Krasner (Mrs. Jackson Pollock) takes her husband&#x27;s paint and enamels and changes his unrestrained, sweeping lines into neat little squares and triangles.&quot; Even after the rise of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s, Krasner&#x27;s artistic career was always put into relation to Pollock since remarks made about her work often commented on how she had become a successful artist by moving out of Pollock&#x27;s shadow. In articles about her work, Pollock is continually referred to. Krasner is still sometimes referred to as &quot;Action Widow&quot;, a term coined in 1972 by art critic B. H. Friedman who accused the female surviving partners of Abstract Expressionist artists of artistic dependence on their male partners. Typically in the 1940s and 1950s, Krasner also would not sign works at all, sign with the genderless initials &quot;L.K.&quot;, or blend her signature into the painting in order to not emphasize her status as a woman and as a wife to another painter.

==Legacy==
Mary Beth Edelson&#x27;s &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci’s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, with the heads of notable women artists, including Krasner&#x27;s, collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. The image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.&quot;

Krasner died on June 19, 1984, age 75, at New York Hospital. Krasner led a successful commercial career and was in charge of her husband&#x27;s estate, and at the time of her death, her estate was worth over $20 million.

Six months after her death, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City held a retrospective exhibition of her work. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that it &quot;clearly defines Krasner&#x27;s place in the New York School&quot; and that she &quot;is a major, independent artist of the pioneer Abstract Expressionist generation, whose stirring work ranks high among that produced here in the last half-century.&quot; As of 2008, Krasner is one of only four women artists to have had a retrospective show at this institution. The other three women are Louise Bourgeois (1982), Helen Frankenthaler (1989) and Elizabeth Murray (2004).

Her papers were donated to the Archives of American Art in 1985; they were digitized and posted on the web for researchers.

After her death, her East Hampton property became the Pollock-Krasner House and Studio, and is open to the public for tours. A separate organization, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, was established in 1985. The Foundation functions as the official estate for both Krasner and Pollock, and also, under the terms of her will, serves &quot;to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need.&quot; The U.S. copyright representative for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.

On November 11, 2003, &quot;Celebration,&quot; a large painting from 1960 sold to the Cleveland Museum of Art for $1.9 million and in May 2008, &quot;Polar Stampede&quot; sold for $3.2 million. &quot;No one today could persist in calling her a peripheral talent,&quot; said critic Robert Hughes.

In 2016 her work was included in the exhibition &quot;Women of Abstract Expressionism&quot; organized by the Denver Art Museum.

In 2017 Krasner was one of the subjects of the book &quot;Ninth Street Women: Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, Grace Hartigan, Joan Mitchell, and Helen Frankenthaler: Five Painters and the Movement That Changed Modern Art&quot; by Mary Gabriel.

Krasner&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

In 2023 her work was included in the exhibition &quot;Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-1970&quot; at the Whitechapel Gallery in London.

==In popular culture==
Krasner was portrayed by Marcia Gay Harden in the film &quot;Pollock&quot; (2000), which is about the life of her husband Jackson Pollock. Harden won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.

In John Updike&#x27;s novel &quot;Seek My Face&quot; (2002), a significant portion of the main character&#x27;s life is based on Krasner&#x27;s.

==Personal life==

===Relationship with Jackson Pollock===
Krasner and Jackson Pollock established a relationship in 1942 after they both exhibited at the McMillen Gallery. She was intrigued by his work and the fact she did not know who he was even though she knew many abstract painters in New York. She went to his apartment to meet him. By 1945, they moved to The Springs on the outskirts of East Hampton, New York. In the summer of that year, they got married in a church with two witnesses.

While the two lived in the farmhouse in The Springs, they continued creating art. They worked in separate studio spaces with Krasner in an upstairs bedroom in the house while Pollock worked in the barn in their backyard. When not working, the two spent their time cooking, baking, gardening, keeping the house organized, and entertaining friends.

By 1956, their relationship became strained as they faced certain issues. Pollock had begun struggling with his alcoholism and was having an extramarital affair with Ruth Kligman. Krasner left in the summertime to visit friends in Europe but had to quickly return when Pollock died in a car crash while she was away.

===Religion===
Krasner was brought up in an orthodox Jewish home throughout her childhood and adolescence. Her family lived in Brownsville, Brooklyn, which had a large population of poor Jewish immigrants. Her father spent most of his time practicing Judaism, and her mother kept up the household and the family business. Krasner appreciated aspects of Judaism like Hebrew script, prayers, and religious stories.

As a teenager, she grew critical of what she perceived as misogyny in orthodox Judaism. In an interview later in her life, Krasner recalls reading a prayer translation and thinking it was &quot;indeed a beautiful prayer in every sense except for the closing of it...if you are a male you say, &#x27;Thank You, O Lord, for creating me in Your image&#x27;; and if you are a woman you say, &#x27;Thank You, O Lord, for creating me as You saw fit.&#x27;&quot; She also began reading existentialist philosophies during this time period, causing her to turn from Judaism even further.

While she married Pollock in a church, Krasner continued to identify herself as Jewish but decided to not practice the religion. Her identity as a Jewish woman has affected how scholars interpret the meaning of her art.

<doc id="584665" wikidata="Q154596" url="?curid=584665" title="Treaties of Tilsit">
<text>The Treaties of Tilsit (), also collectively known as the Peace of Tilsit (; ), were two peace treaties signed by French Emperor Napoleon in the town of Tilsit in July 1807 in the aftermath of his victory at Friedland, at the end of the War of the Fourth Coalition. The first was signed on 7 July, between Napoleon and Russian Emperor Alexander I, when they met on a raft in the middle of the Neman river. The second was signed with Prussia on 9 July. The treaties were made at the expense of King Frederick William III of Prussia, who had already agreed to a truce on 25 June after the had captured Berlin and pursued him to the easternmost frontier of his realm. 

In Tilsit, Prussia ceded about half of its pre-war territories. From these territories, Napoleon had created French client states, which were formalized and recognized at Tilsit: the Kingdom of Westphalia, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Free City of Danzig; the other ceded territories were awarded to existing French client states and to Russia.

Napoleon not only cemented his control of Central Europe but also had Russia and the truncated Prussia ally with him against his two remaining enemies, the United Kingdom and Sweden, triggering the Anglo-Russian and Finnish wars. Tilsit also freed French forces for the Peninsular War. Central Europe became a battlefield again in 1809 when Austria engaged France in the War of the Fifth Coalition.

==Franco-Russian treaty (7 July)==
The treaty ended the war between Imperial Russia and the French Empire and began an alliance between the two empires that rendered the rest of continental Europe almost powerless. The two countries secretly agreed to aid each other in disputes. France pledged to aid Russia against the Ottoman Empire while Russia agreed to join the Continental System against the British Empire. Napoleon also convinced Alexander to enter into the Anglo-Russian War and to instigate the Finnish War against Sweden to force Sweden to join the Continental System. More specifically, the Tsar agreed to evacuate Wallachia and Moldavia, which had been occupied by Russian forces as part of the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812. The Ionian Islands and Cattaro (Kotor), which had been captured by Russian admirals Ushakov and Senyavin, were to be handed over to the French. In recompense, Napoleon guaranteed the sovereignty of the Duchy of Oldenburg and several other small states ruled by the Tsar&#x27;s German relatives.

==Franco-Prussian treaty (9 July)==
The treaty with Prussia stripped the country of about half its territory: Cottbus passed to Saxony, the left bank of the Elbe was awarded to the newly created Kingdom of Westphalia, Białystok was given to Russia (which led to the creation of the Belostok Oblast), and most of the Polish lands in Prussian possession since the Second and Third Partitions became the quasi-independent Duchy of Warsaw. Prussia was to reduce the army to 43,000 and on 9 March 1808, France fixed its tribute to be levied from Prussia at 154,500,000 francs (= Prussian dollar 41.73 mio.), deducting 53,500,000, which had been raised so far during the ongoing French occupation. The sum was lowered in two steps to 120 million francs by 1 November 1808.

Talleyrand had advised Napoleon to pursue milder terms; the treaties marked an important stage in his estrangement from the emperor. Until 1812, the French occupants requisitioned in money and kind from various corporations and persons, especially by billetting soldiers on cities, further contributions additionally amounting to between 146 and 309 million francs, according to different calculations. The Prussian government indebtedness soared between 1806 and 1815 by thaler 200 million to altogether 180.09 million interest-bearing debts, 11.24 million non-interest-bearing unconsolidated treasury notes and another 25.9 million former provincial debts assumed by the royal government. The cities&#x27; debts, especially those of Berlin often billetted on, were not assumed by the Prussian government. Since the creditors deemed Prussia to be over-indebted in 1817, the 4-per cent state bonds were traded at the bourses with a disagio of 27 to 29 percent, in 1818 even with a discountor of 35 percent, causing the effective interest to rise to 6.15 percent. At restructuring part of the debts in 1818 by a £5 million loan (= thaler 30 million) at 5% at the London financial market, the Prussian government had to accept a disagio of 28⅓%, thus paying an annual effective rate of 6.98%.

When the Treaty was being formulated, it was noted by an observer that the Prussian king was pacing on the bank of the Neman river; Napoleon had to &quot;but raise his hand, and Prussia would cease to exist&quot; (McKay). Hence, many observers in Prussia and Russia viewed the treaty as unequal and as a national humiliation. The Russian soldiers refused to follow Napoleon&#x27;s commands, as the Lisbon Incident demonstrated to all Europe. Napoleon&#x27;s plans to marry the tsar&#x27;s sister were stymied by Russian royalty. Cooperation between Russia and France eventually broke down in 1810 when the tsar began to allow neutral ships to land in Russian ports. In 1812, Napoleon crossed the Neman river and invaded Russia, ending any vestige of alliance.

===Territorial and population losses suffered by Prussia===
The Prussian state was diminished by more than half under the terms of the Treaties of Tilsit, from 5,700 square miles to 2,800 square miles. Compared to the 9.75 million inhabitants Prussia had prior to the Treaties of Tilsit, no more than 4.5 million inhabitants remained within the new boundaries of the Prussian state. 

The state revenue, which formerly amounted to forty million dollars per year, was decreased in a even greater proportion. The ceded provinces were rich and fertile, and many millions had been spent on their improvement. Almost all that Prussia had gained by the partitions of Poland (1772–1795) was taken away from Prussia. The Kingdom of Saxony, a former confederate of Prussia, was the recipient of the provinces. Russia, the more powerful of its erstwhile allies, gained territory with a population of 200,000 inhabitants. The following is a tabulation of the territorial and population losses that Prussia sustained, but not accounting for the Prussian acquisitions since 1772, under the terms of the Tilsit Treaties:
==Aftermath==

The War of the Fourth Coalition was over. The Peninsular War began on 19 November 1807 and the War of the Fifth Coalition began in 1809.

The Neman was crossed at the outset of the 1812 French invasion of Russia.

Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the Congress of Vienna would restore many Prussian territories.

By signing these treaties, France left Persia and the Ottomans, who had previously hoped for France&#x27;s help under treaties with France (including Finckenstein), in the face of Russian aggression, and established the loss of parts of Persia in the Caucasus, such as the present-day republics Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia.

<doc id="584678" wikidata="Q888957" url="?curid=584678" title="George W. P. Hunt">
<text>George Wylie Paul Hunt (November 1, 1859 – December 24, 1934) was an American politician and businessman. He was the first governor of Arizona, serving a total of seven terms, along with President of the convention that wrote Arizona&#x27;s constitution. In addition, Hunt served in both houses of the Arizona Territorial Legislature and was posted as U.S. Minister to Siam by Woodrow Wilson.

Calling himself the &quot;Old Walrus&quot;, Hunt was tall, close to , bald, and had a drooping handlebar moustache.
Politically, he took on aspects from the populist, and later progressive, movements who supported reforms such as women&#x27;s suffrage, secret ballots, income tax, free silver coinage, and compulsory education. Hunt was also an opponent of capital punishment and a supporter of organized labor.

==Background==
Hunt was born in Huntsville, Missouri, to George Washington and Sarah Elizabeth (Yates) Hunt on November 1, 1859. His family was originally well-to-do, with the town of Huntsville having been named for Hunt&#x27;s grandfather, but lost its fortune as a result of the American Civil War. After being educated in a combination of public and private schools, Hunt ran away from his family on March 3, 1878. For three years, his family believed he had been killed by Indians while Hunt traveled through Kansas, Colorado and rafted down the Rio Grande.

Hunt arrived in Globe, Arizona, his home for the rest of his life, with two burros and needing a job. His first job was as a waiter in the Pasco Café. This was followed by a series of odd jobs, including a mucker in a mine and work on a cattle ranch, before he became a clerk at a general store. Early experience in the grocery department led Hunt to perform most of his household&#x27;s shopping. The store was purchased by a larger concern, the Old Dominion Commercial Company, and Hunt advanced to become president of the combined business. Following his election as governor, he sold his company stock and limited his investments to government bonds.

Hunt married Helen Duett Ellison in Holbrook, Arizona, on February 24, 1904. The couple had a single daughter, named Virginia. Hunt&#x27;s personal interests included cultivation of rare shrubs and trees along with collection of Southwestern Indian art. He was a Freemason and an Oddfellow.

==Arizona Territory==
Hunt&#x27;s first foray into politics was an unsuccessful 1890 run for county recorder of Gila County. This was followed by successful runs for the Territorial House of Representatives in 1892 and 1894. During his first term as a Representative, Hunt sponsored legislation authorizing a US$5,000 reward for capture of the Apache Kid.

After two terms in the lower house Hunt successfully ran for a seat in the upper house, the council, in 1896. During the 1897 legislative session, he sponsored legislation requiring children between eight and fourteen years of age attend school for a minimum of twelve weeks per year. Hunt was reelected to the Council in 1898 before voluntarily leaving politics until 1904. Upon reentering politics, he was again elected to the council in 1904, 1906, and 1908. During the 23rd Arizona Territorial Legislature, Hunt was President of the council but was unable to secure passage of his bill providing primary elections to nominate political candidates. During the 1907 legislative session he secured passage of a bill outlawing gambling within the territory. During his final legislative session, Hunt once again served as President of the council and won passage of his bill creating nominating primaries.

Following passage of Arizona&#x27;s Enabling Act, an election was called to select delegates to a constitutional convention. Hunt won election as one of five delegates from Gila County. On the first day of the convention, Hunt was in turn selected as president for the convention. The last surviving member of the convention, Jacob Weinberger, later recalled Hunt as a &quot;behind-the-scenes manipulator who presided in the manner of a stoic, benign Buddha– if one can picture Buddha with a splendid handlebar mustache.&quot; Among the features of the new constitution that he supported were initiative, recall, and referendum.

Hunt announced his candidacy for governor of the new state in September 1911. Following victory in the Democratic primary, he went on to a narrow victory over Republican challenger Edmund W. Wells to be elected first Governor of Arizona.

==First terms==
Hunt was sworn in as Arizona&#x27;s first state governor on February 14, 1912. When the new legislature met in March of the same year, he lobbied for passage of legislation restricting child labor, lobbying, and usury. Other legislation supported by Hunt included requirements for newspapers to disclose their ownership, creation of workers&#x27; compensation, and creating old age pensions. During his first term as governor, several labor laws were introduced.
Due to an Arizona Supreme Court ruling that there would be no elections for state officials in 1912, Hunt&#x27;s first run for reelection did not occur until 1914. After defeating Ralph H. Cameron, the governor&#x27;s second term was dominated by events along the United States–Mexico border. Conflict from the Mexican Revolution began affecting American interests by April 1914. This was followed by an October 11, 1914 attack on Naco, Arizona. Hunt considered deploying the Arizona National Guard to protect American lives, but was convinced by Secretary of War Lindley M. Garrison to allow U.S. Army troops to handle the conflict. Problems with cross border shootings continued with the American military unable to prevent the violence without crossing into Mexico.

The elections of 1916 resulted in a contested election result. Initial results showed that challenger Thomas E. Campbell had won by 30 votes, but Hunt challenged the results claiming that several precincts had experienced fraudulent voting. Hunt initially refused to leave office, but a January 27, 1917, ruling by the Arizona Supreme Court naming Campbell the &quot;de facto&quot; governor forced him to surrender his office. The former governor maintained his fights in the court, and on December 22, 1917, was declared the winner of the 1916 election by a total of 43 votes. Hunt returned to office for his third term on December 25, 1917.

With the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, Hunt began knitting scarves for soldiers as a patriotic duty and said he wished he could serve with the U.S. Marines. The governor&#x27;s associations with the Industrial Workers of the World however caused his loyalties to be questioned. After a person from Flagstaff challenged his loyalties, Hunt filed a lawsuit claiming libel and was awarded one cent in damages.

==Minister to Siam==

In 1918, Hunt decided not to run for reelection and left office in January 1919. He soon became bored and began looking for new challenges. One such challenge was his attempt to learn how to drive an automobile. After driving into a ditch several times, he described the experience with: &quot;One started out in the morning with exhilaration and by nightfall was towed home in shame.&quot;

By early 1920, Hunt was believed to be planning a run for Mark Smith&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat. To counter this possible threat, it is rumored that Smith, with the help of Henry F. Ashurst, asked President Woodrow Wilson to appoint Hunt to a diplomatic position that would take him away from Arizona. The story continues with Wilson placing his finger on a globe and asking &quot;Would this be far enough?&quot; Hunt was confirmed as the U.S. Minister to Siam on May 18, 1920.

Hunt was replaced as Minister to Siam by President Warren G. Harding on October 4, 1921.
While in Siam, Hunt had maintained contact with Arizona by sending postcards. The former governor also brought back a variety of souvenirs to hand out to his supporters. Upon his return, Hunt began speaking to various groups within Arizona about his experiences overseas. After a short time, the topic of these speeches changed to politics, and by mid-1922 Hunt was running for his fourth term as Governor of Arizona.

==1920s==

Beginning in 1923, Hunt served as Governor of Arizona for six consecutive years, winning closely contested reelection contests in both 1924 and 1926. Arizona&#x27;s primary political issue during this time period was ratification of the Colorado River Compact.
The governor opposed ratification of the compact, which appropriated water rights to the Colorado River among seven states, claiming that it gave California an unfair share of &quot;Arizona&#x27;s birthright&quot;. The issue was of such importance to Hunt that Arizonans of the day joked that while Jesus had walked on water, their governor ran on the Colorado River.

In addition to his stance on the Colorado River, Hunt&#x27;s political longevity became a source of pointed comments. During his fifth term, Hunt&#x27;s political opponents gave the governor the sobriquet &quot;George V&quot;. This was updated to &quot;George VI&quot; after he won a sixth term. During a 1928 meeting at the Phoenix airport, Will Rogers picked up on the theme by asking Hunt to adopt the humorist so that he could succeed to his &quot;hereditary governorship&quot;.

Unwilling to subject Arizona lawyers to &quot;foreign&quot; imposition of unlimited terms in their membership organization, Governor Hunt included a &quot;sunset&quot; provision in legislation creating a unified bar. The legislation unceremoniously expired in 1984 and is still the subject of legal controversy. Governor Hunt had been pressured to institute a uniform code by delegates visiting Arizona from the American Bar Association from Chicago.

==Later years==

Hunt was defeated in his 1928 reelection bid, swept aside by that year&#x27;s Republican landslide. His 1930 campaign was successful, and Hunt returned for a seventh term. His wife died April 18, 1931, their marriage lasting 27 years. Hunt failed to gain his party&#x27;s nomination in 1932, losing to Benjamin Baker Moeur, and made another unsuccessful run in 1934. Hunt died of heart failure at home on December 24. 1934. He was interred in a white pyramid set atop a hill in Phoenix&#x27;s Papago Park.

The institute opened in 1970 as a Regional Technical College, and adopted the name &#x27;Institute of Technology, Sligo&#x27; on 7 May 1997. The first students graduated with degrees from Sligo RTC in 1986.

Con Power served as principal of the college from its foundation in 1972 until 1979. Prof. Terri Scott was the institute&#x27;s first female president, serving from 2008 until 2014. She was succeeded by Prof. Vincent Cunnane in October 2014. Dr. Brendan McCormack was appointed president of the institute in September 2016.

==Development==

IT Sligo developed a number of distance learning options, and as of 2016 reportedly had 1,800 online learners registered on various online programmes. This subsequently increased to approximately 3000 online learners.

<text>Bear Valley Mountain Resort is a ski area in the western United States, located in the Sierra Nevada of California on Highway 4 between Lake Tahoe and Yosemite National Park—about three hours southeast of Sacramento and one hour from Angels Camp. The alpine ski area and a portion of the real estate in the village of Bear Valley was owned by an investment partnership led by a Canadian company, Dundee Realty, from 2005 to 2014, then by Skyline International acquired Bear Valley through October 31, 2023. 
On November 1, 2023, California Mountain Resort Company, backed by Invision Capital of Chicago, along with ski industry investors Karl Kapuscinski and Tom Cohen announced that they acquired Bear Valley along with properties in the village of Bear Valley. With the acquisition, Bear Valley joins the &quot;Cali Pass&quot; giving pass holders to access 3 other ski resorts in California, as well as resorts at 19 &quot;Powder Alliance Resorts&quot; world wide. The new owners have made many improvements, such as a new bar, refurbished restaurants and completed 4 different lift upgrade projects over the summer of 2024. 

==Skiing==
Nine lifts provide access to 75+ runs covering . The resort is known for its commitment to snow making and snow science expertise, and as a result of snow management, was one of six resorts in California that remained open into mid-spring during the worst droughts in history.

The festival, which begins at the end of July and runs for 2 weeks and 3 weekends, includes a variety of music, including contemporary bands and classical concerts featuring a full symphony orchestra conducted by Maestro Alexander Mickelthwate.

== Future development plans ==
A lift from town has been planned for years, as is a mountain top day lodge and terrain expansion. In early 2013, the partnership that owns the ski area operation and a portion of the real estate in town decided to sell their holdings which now include entitlements for over 300 condominium homes. In September 2013, a deal to sell the ski area operation fell through. In December 2013 a group of Bear Valley property owners announced an initiative to explore community ownership options for both the ski area operation and the village. In February 2014, the Bear Valley Mountain Cooperative was formed with the objective of acquiring and managing those assets on behalf of the community. In 2014, the resort was acquired by Skyline International.

<doc id="584682" wikidata="Q1248924" url="?curid=584682" title="Tetbury">
<text>Tetbury is a town and civil parish inside the Cotswold district in Gloucestershire, England. It lies on the site of an ancient hill fort, on which an Anglo-Saxon monastery was founded, probably by Ine of Wessex, in 681. The population of the parish was 5,250 in the 2001 census, increasing to 5,472 at the 2011 census. The population further increased to 6,453 in the 2021 Census.

==History==
During the Middle Ages, Tetbury became an important market for Cotswold wool and yarn. Notable buildings in the town include the Church House and the late 18th century Gothic revival parish church of St Mary the Virgin and St Mary Magdalene and much of the rest of the town centre, dates from the 16th and 17th centuries. The Market House, dating from 1655 with restorations done in 1817, is a fine example of a Cotswold pillared market house that used to trade wool and yarn which was the main source of the town&#x27;s wealth, it is still in use as a meeting place and market. Other attractions include the Tetbury Police Museum and Courtroom, Chavenage House, Highgrove House and Westonbirt Arboretum lie just outside the town.

The Tetbury Woolsack Races, founded 1972, is an annual competition where participants must carry a sack of wool up and down a steep hill (&quot;Gumstool Hill&quot;). The Tetbury Woolsack Races take place on the &quot;late May Bank Holiday&quot;, the last Monday in May each year.

Tetbury has won five consecutive Gold awards in the Regional &quot;Heart of England in Bloom&quot; competition in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and was category winner &quot;Best Small Town&quot; in 2008, 2009 and 2010. In 2010 Tetbury was Overall Winner of Heart of England in Bloom and won a Judges Discretionary Award for Community Achievement. Tetbury won Silver Gilt as a first-time entrant in the National Britain in Bloom Campaign in 2009 and a second Silver Gilt in Britain in Bloom in 2011.

==Geography==

Tetbury is situated in a landscape of gently rolling hills primarily used for farmland, including grazing of sheep and grain production. Its location is associated with a nearby major east–west trade or drovers trail, which would account for its early importance as a wool trade centre. Nearby to the west are Owlpen Manor, Beverston Castle and Calcot Manor. The Tetbury Avon, a tributary of the Bristol Avon, known locally as the Ingleburn rises to the north of the town.

==Governance==
Most of Tetbury falls in the Tetbury parish, although some of the northern parts of the town are officially in Tetbury Upton.

Tetbury is in the Cotswold district, and amenities are run by Cotswold District Council. Gloucestershire County Council is also responsible for some services in the town.

Nationally, Tetbury was in the Cotswold constituency from 1997 to 2024. Since the 2024 general election, it forms a part of the South Cotswolds constituency, represented in Parliament by the Liberal Democrat Roz Savage. 

==Economy==

Tetbury is renowned for its antique and bric-à-brac shops; &quot;Homes &amp; Antiques&quot; magazine named Long Street one of the UK&#x27;s top 10 favourite streets for shopping in December 2018. The town centre also has a number of independent specialist food and clothing shops, banks, charity shops, estate agents and other shops including lifestyle clothing brand Overider and the Prince of Wales&#x27;s original &quot;Highgrove Shop&quot; which opened in 2008.

A Tesco supermarket branch was opened a quarter of a mile from the town centre in July 2002. The town&#x27;s high street is the home to a number of specialist shops selling cheese, breads, meats, dairy and frozen products, entertainment supplies, among others.

The town has pubs and hotels, including the Royal Oak Inn which was featured in the 1971 film &quot;Dulcima&quot; and in an episode of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Bonekickers&quot;. The Trouble House, immediately outside the town, was served by Trouble House Halt between 1959 and 1964.

==Culture==
Events in the town include Woolsack Day, held on the last Bank Holiday in May, famous for the races and street fair. A flower show is held at the recreation ground. The first &quot;Tetbury Fiesta&quot; was held on the recreation ground in July 2008. Tetbury Music Festival is held in early October.

==Hospital==
Tetbury Hospital is a privately run facility which funds itself from government funding and charitable donations. The hospital, which homes a Minor Injuries Unit, was rated as &quot;needing improvement&quot; by the Care Quality Commission in 2016. In 2005 it was announced that beds at the site would be cut. The nearest Accident and Emergency Department is in Cirencester.

==Education==
The town has two schools, St Mary&#x27;s Primary School and Sir William Romney&#x27;s School, a secondary school which specialises in creative arts. In 2006 Sir William Romney&#x27;s announced that it would be closing its Sixth Form centre, meaning students wishing to sit A-Levels now travel to Cirencester, Stroud or Filton College in Bristol. Westonbirt School is an independent school for girls aged 11 to 18.

Some Tetbury children travel further afield, with students at the two grammar schools, Marling School for boys and Stroud High School for girls, both in Stroud, and some at the comprehensive Deer Park School in Cirencester.

==Transport==
Tetbury has bus services which serve local towns. Tetbury railway station closed in 1964, and the nearest railway station is now at Kemble; the nearest major airport is Bristol Airport. General aviation uses Kemble Airport at Kemble. The former airfield at Long Newnton, southeast of Tetbury, was home to the Cotswold Gliding Club from 1964 to 1967 when it moved to nearby Aston Down.

Tetbury is on the A433, with easy access to the M4 and M5 motorways. The A4135 originates in Tetbury and proceeds westerly through Beverston.

<text>The National Diploma (NDip) () was a three-year ab initio specialised higher education qualification in a technology discipline offered by an Institute of Technology or other HETAC designated institution in Ireland.

Alternatively, a National Diploma could be offered as a one-year post National Certificate type course. The diploma generally exempted a student from the first two or three years of a four-year university Honours Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Ireland. Northern Ireland universities considered the standard equivalent to the BTEC Higher National Diploma, this was also the position adopted by most British universities that have large entrance from the Republic. Many of the courses were in business, engineering and science. Most entrants were school leavers presenting the Leaving Certificate or the National Certificate and many continued their studies to honours Bachelor&#x27;s degree level.

The National Diploma in Ireland was first awarded in 1973 by several Regional Technical Colleges. The National Diploma has been replaced by the &quot;Ordinary Bachelor&#x27;s Degree&quot; under the National Framework of Qualifications. This was decided by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland recently. The National Diploma has not been awarded since June 2006.

<text>The National Certificate is a higher education qualification in a technology discipline offered by higher institutions across the globe. Each country has its own specifications about the certificate.

==Ireland==

The National Certificate () was a two-year broadly based higher education qualification in a technology discipline offered by an Institute of Technology or a HETAC-designated institution in Ireland. The certificate generally exempts a student from the first year of a four-year university Bachelor&#x27;s degree or the first two years of an ab initio National Diploma in Ireland. The certificates are often in business, engineering and science, with most entrants being school leavers and presenting a Leaving Certificate or similar educational achievement. Many students continue education and transfer to a National Diploma course or a Bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The first National Certificates in Ireland were awarded in 1972 at five Regional Technical Colleges. Since June 2006 and the implementation of the National Framework of Qualifications, the National Certificate has been replaced by the Higher Certificate in a number of similar disciplines.

==United Kingdom==

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===

In the educational systems of England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the National Certificate is a standard vocational further education qualification. It is usually rated at Level 3 on the National Qualifications Framework and is equivalent to A-level, BTEC Extended Diploma or NVQ Level 3 standard.

===Scotland===

National Certificate courses in Scotland are a one-year course offered by Technical Colleges. They are typically used to progress on to a Higher National Certificate or similar degree course, although a National Certificate is still a recognised qualification on its own.

==Mauritius==

In Mauritius, the National Certificate is a vocational qualification, with a level mapped to the National Qualifications Framework (NQF).

<text>This article lists political parties in Minnesota.

==History==
Minnesota has had a history of favoring the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) candidates in presidential elections since the 1960s. However, Minnesota has also had an active Republican Party that has been viewed as gaining more support since the late 1990s and early 2000s due to population migration to the suburbs along with the party&#x27;s focus on socially conservative positions on gun control, abortion and gay rights. The DFL won a majority in the Minnesota House of Representatives for the first time since 1996 in the 2006 elections, defeating the Republican majority. Republicans won a majority in both houses of the Minnesota Legislature in the 2010 elections for the first time since 1973 when party designation for state legislators was reinstated, but lost both majorities to the DFL in the 2012 elections. The governorship is held by DFLer Tim Walz.

Minnesota has one of the strongest levels of support among the states for independent and third-party candidates.

===Third parties===
The Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party was a populist political party that managed to elect some of its candidates to the United States Congress, a rare feat among American third political parties, and eventually merged with the Minnesota Democratic Party in 1944 to create the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party. The success of the Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party shielded Minnesota from the worst of the restrictive ballot access laws that were passed in most states during the Red Scare era of the 1920s to 1950s. State law governing nominating petitions for third-party candidates and the definition of a major and minor political party have not prevented the rise of more than two major political parties, and have ensured that several different candidates are on the ballot in most state and federal elections.

In 1998, the Reform Party of Minnesota candidate for governor, Jesse Ventura, won the election. The Reform Party later became the Independence Party of Minnesota. In 2002, Sheila Kiscaden, who had previously been a Republican, was re-elected as a member of the Independence Party. The Green Party of Minnesota has had electoral success in city elections, particularly Minneapolis and Saint Paul.

==Recognition==
Qualifying as a recognized major or minor political party is determined by how many candidates a party nominates for certain partisan offices, how well candidates for statewide office do in certain partisan elections, or a petition that has the required number of signatures. Generally, a party that presents a statewide candidate that receives at least eight percent of the vote or presents a petition to the secretary of state containing a number of signatures equal to at least five percent of the number of individuals who voted in the preceding general election qualifies as a recognized major party. Similarly, the threshold is one percent to qualify as a recognized minor party.

Parties recognized as a major or minor party are eligible to receive funds from the state elections campaign account. Recognized major parties also have automatic ballot access.

<doc id="584700" wikidata="Q2032984" url="?curid=584700" title="Rolls-Royce BR700">
<text>The Rolls-Royce BR700 is a family of turbofan engines for regional jets and corporate jets. It is manufactured in Dahlewitz, Germany, by Rolls-Royce Deutschland: this was initially a joint venture of BMW and Rolls-Royce plc established in 1990 to develop this engine. The BR710 first ran in 1995. The United States military designation for the BR725 variant is F130.

==Design and development==

===BR710===
The BR710 is a twin shaft turbofan, and entered service on the Gulfstream V in 1997 and the Bombardier Global Express in 1998. This version has also been selected to power the Gulfstream G550.

The BR710 comprises a diameter single-stage fan, driven by a two-stage LP turbine, and a ten-stage HP compressor (scaled from the V2500 unit) driven by a two-stage, air-cooled, HP turbine.

This engine has a thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) of at static sea level takeoff and at a cruise speed of Mach 0.8 and altitude of .

In May 2017, the 3,200 engines in service reached 10 million flying hours.

===BR715===
The BR715 is another twin-shaft turbofan; this engine was first run in April 1997 and entered service in mid-1999. This version powers the Boeing 717.

A new LP spool, comprising a diameter single-stage fan, with two-stage LP compressor driven by a three-stage LP turbine, is incorporated into the BR715. The HP spool is similar to that of the BR710.

The IP compressor booster stages supercharge the core, increasing core power and thereby net thrust. However, a larger fan is required, to keep the specific thrust low enough to satisfy jet noise considerations.

This engine has a TSFC of at static sea level takeoff and at a cruise speed of Mach 0.8 and altitude of .

===BR725===

The BR725 is a variant of the BR710 to power the Gulfstream G650.
Its prototype underwent component bench and its first full engine run in spring 2008. 
European certification was achieved in June 2009.
The first Gulfstream G650, with BR725 engines, was delivered in December 2011.
The engine has a maximum thrust of .
The fan with 24 swept blades is larger than the BR710. The HP axial compressor benefits from three-dimensional aerodynamics for greater efficiency and has 10 stages including five blisks to reduce weight.
The BR715 inspired combustor yields a longer life and lower emissions: 80% lower smoke and unburned hydrocarbons and 35% lower NOx than CAEP 6 limits.
The two-stage HP turbine has blade active tip-clearance control for more efficiency; 3D aerodynamics reduce the cooling air flow. The LP turbine has three stages instead of two.
The BR725 has a bypass ratio of 4.2:1 and is 4 dB quieter than the predecessor BR710. Its cruise thrust specific fuel consumption at Mach 0.85 and FL450 is .

===F130===
On 24 September 2021, the United States Air Force (USAF) selected the F130 (the US military designation for the BR725) for the B-52H Stratofortress Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP). This version has thrust, similar to the existing engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33). The USAF will purchase 650 engines (608 direct replacements, 42 spares) for its fleet of 76 B-52H aircraft in a $2.6 billion deal; upgraded aircraft will be redesignated B-52J.

The CERP engines will be built at Rolls-Royce North America&#x27;s plant in Indianapolis, Indiana, 

===Future developments===
The Advance 2 development effort inserts new, advanced technology into existing class BR710 and the larger BR725 engines. An even larger engine will also be made, with a fan. The BR710 and BR715 main developments, the next generation of engines to be introduced in the 2020s, will have an Advance 3 core, improved engine health management, newer materials, and cooling. They will also have a “blisk” fan made out of titanium, with an overall pressure ratio of 50:1. These improvements will yield a 10% thrust specific fuel consumption reduction, 50% NOx margin improvement, 99.995% reliability, and a 20% better thrust-to-weight ratio.

===Pearl 15===

The Pearl engine was developed in Dahlewitz from the BR700 with Advance2 technologies.
EASA certification was applied for on 28 February 2015.
It made its first ground run in 2015, type tests in 2016, and flight tests in 2017.
Six test engines logged over 6,000 cycles on 2,000 test hours.
The test program included lightning strike, water ingestion, ice, and -40 °C cold-start testing.

EASA certification was granted on 28 February 2018 and it was unveiled on 28 May 2018.
It was undergoing flight tests in May 2018 for an end of 2019 planned entry into service aboard the Bombardier Global Express 5500 and 6500 developments.
It should have logged 10,000 hours by then.
Its layout is similar to the BR725, with the same stage count and 24 titanium fan blades.
Its fan has a diameter.
The enhanced 3-stage turbine with advanced high temperature materials, advanced segments and seals allow for higher pressures and temperatures and the new low emissions cooled combustor includes a new tiled combustion chamber.
Its core uses advanced nickel alloys and ceramic coatings, includes a new 10-stage compressor with 6 titanium blisks and a new 2-stage HP turbine with enhanced aerodynamics and blade cooling, enhanced segments and seals.

Its overall pressure ratio attains 43:1 and its bypass ratio 4.8:1.
The HP compressor ratio rises to 24:1.
It delivers up to 9% more thrust with and a 7% TSFC improvement while being 2 decibels quieter.
Health monitoring should improve on the BR710 99.97% dispatch reliability which is logging one unplanned engine removal per 100,000 hours while the BR715 is approaching zero unplanned removals.

===Pearl 700===

The Pearl 700 will power the Gulfstream G700, a stretch of the previous G650, and the G800, with more range than the G650ER.
Evolved from the BR725 with a similar architecture plus a fourth low-pressure turbine stage and a larger, blisk fan, its bypass ratio is higher than 6.5:1 and its overall pressure ratio should exceed 50:1.
It should provide of thrust, 3-5% better thrust specific fuel consumption than the BR725 variant powering the Gulfstream G650, reduced emissions and lower noise.

===Pearl 10X===

The upcoming Dassault Falcon 10X will be powered by two Pearl 10X engines over thrust, with a titanium fan blisk, a 10-stage compressor, a two-stage shroudless HP turbine and a four-stage turbine.
The initial Pearl 10X test engine was first run in early 2022 and the programme had accumulated 1,000h of testing by May, along with the Advance2 demonstrator.
The Advance2 core and new low-pressure system allows 5% more efficiency than the previous Rolls-Royce business jet engines.

<text>The Cedar River is a river in the U.S. state of Washington. About long, it originates in the Cascade Range and flows generally west and northwest, emptying into the southern end of Lake Washington. Its upper watershed is a protected area called the Cedar River Watershed, which provides drinking water for the greater Seattle area.

The Cedar River drains into Puget Sound via Lake Washington and the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

==Course==

The Cedar River originates in the Cascade Range near Abiel Peak, Meadow Mountain, and Yakima Pass, along the King and Kittitas countyline. Several headwater streams join in the high mountains fed from glacial run-off, then the Cedar River flows generally west. It is impounded in Chester Morse Lake, a natural lake that was dammed in 1900 for use as a water storage reservoir. The Rex River joins the Cedar in Chester Morse Lake, as do the two forks of the Cedar River, the north and south forks.

Below Chester Morse Lake, the Cedar River flows through a smaller lake called Masonry Pool. Below Masonry Pool, the Cedar River flows by two former railroad sites, Bagley Junction and Trude. The river then exits the Cedar River Watershed at Landsburg where pipelines route water to the Seattle area.

Below the Cedar River Watershed area, the river flows west and north, past the cities of Maple Valley and Renton. At Renton, the Cedar River empties into the southern end of Lake Washington. Its waters eventually enter Puget Sound via the Lake Washington Ship Canal. 

==River modifications and management==
The upper Cedar River watershed is a protected area called the Cedar River Municipal Watershed. About 90,000 acres (364 km²) in size, it is owned by the City of Seattle. The Cedar River Watershed provides drinking water for 1.4 million people in the greater Seattle area. About two-thirds of King County uses water from the Cedar River Watershed, over per day. The reservoirs and pipeline infrastructure is owned and operated by Seattle Public Utilities. Public access is restricted and the area is managed as a wilderness in order to protect water quality.

Chester Morse Lake is the main storage reservoir of the Cedar River Watershed system. Pipelines route water to the Seattle area from Landsburg, at the western edge of the protected watershed area.

Before 1912 the Cedar River did not empty into Lake Washington but rather into the Black River. The Black River drained the southern end of Lake Washington, flowing south then west to join the Green River. The Black–Green confluence created the Duwamish River, which emptied into Elliott Bay. In 1911, there was a major flood along the lower Cedar River. This prompted the city of Renton to make a diversion canal so that the Cedar River emptied into Lake Washington instead of the Black River. The diversion was completed in 1912. The Cedar River&#x27;s water, via Lake Washington, still ultimately flowed into the Black River, Duwamish River, and into Elliott Bay.

In 1916 the Lake Washington Ship Canal&#x27;s Montlake Cut was finished, connecting Lake Washington and Lake Union. The water level of Lake Washington dropped 8.8 feet (2.7 m), to the level of Lake Union. As a result, the outlet of Lake Washington became the Ship Canal instead of the Black River. The Black River dried up and no longer exists. Thus, today the Cedar River&#x27;s water enters Lake Washington and then passes through the Ship Canal to Puget Sound, rather than into Elliott Bay via the Duwamish River. Anadromous fish, such as salmon, which used to migrate up the Duwamish and Black rivers to reach the Cedar River, now migrate through the Ship Canal and Lake Washington.

The upper Cedar River flows through a region of deep and porous glacial outwash. A large amount of water seeps into the ground, forming an aquifer. Most of this underground water eventually returns to the surface as springs, flowing mainly into the Cedar River as well as the Snoqualmie River and Rattlesnake Lake. This process acts as a kind of natural water filtration system. As a result, the Cedar River is one of the few rivers in the United States used for drinking water without requiring specially fabricated filtration.

Just south of the Cedar River Watershed is a similar protected area used for drinking water: the Green River Watershed, which supplies water to the greater Tacoma area.

The watershed also has an education center where visitors can learn about the issues that involve the region&#x27;s drinking water, forest and wildlife.

==Environmental issues==
The river has problems with invasive species, erosion, and pollution from adjacent properties and runoff. In 1996, the Friends of the Cedar River Watershed was formed to organize community involvement in protection of the river and its tributaries. The organization focused on education and ecological restoration. The three main programs The Friends of the Cedar River Watershed managed were the Cedar River Salmon Journey, Volunteer Habitat Restoration, and Stewardship in Action. The organization disbanded in 2015, and its programs were absorbed by other entities to continue the work in advocacy and education.

==History==
Efforts to use the Cedar River as a water source began in the 1890s. A dam was built at Landsburg and water diverted into a pipeline. The pipeline sent water to Seattle&#x27;s Volunteer Park and Lincoln reservoirs on Capitol Hill. The first deliveries occurred in 1901. A second pipeline was built in 1909 and a third in 1923.

Another reservoir was constructed in the early 1900s by the City of Seattle on an ancient glacial lake bed. The city constructed a ninety-foot concrete dam and used bedrock to the west and a glacial moraine to the east as natural barriers. The reservoir was known as the Cedar Reservoir and was fed by the Cedar River Drainage. Between the hours of 12AM and 2AM on December 23, 1918 a large section of the Cedar Reservoir failed and spilled between 800,000 and 2,000,000 cubic yards of water. The discharge flowed down Boxley Creek Valley, destroying the town of Edgewick, sawmills (owned by North Bend Lumber Company), and parts of the Milwaukee Railroad. The failure did not occur at the dam, but 6,000 feet on the moraine side of the reservoir. Initial discharge rates were estimated between 3,000 and 20,000 second-feet.

By 1899 the City of Seattle had acquired ownership of most of the Cedar River Watershed. Some land remained privately owned, mainly by logging companies and sawmills. Before 1924 large sections of the forest were cut for timber. Wildfires burned more forests in the wake of logging operations. In 1924 the City of Seattle began the process of managing the Cedar River Watershed with a plan of ensuring water quality for the future. Logging continued, but methods were increasingly regulated and fire precautions strengthened. The 1962 Cedar River Watershed Cooperative Agreement began the process of transferring the remaining privately owned land to the City of Seattle. In 1996 the United States Forest Service ceded its land in the watershed to Seattle. As a result, the city is the sole owner of the Cedar River Watershed area of the upper Cedar River.

==Natural history==
Due to logging in the early 20th century, only about 17%, or 14,000 acres (57 km²), of the Cedar River Watershed consists of old growth forest. The majority of the forest remaining today is second growth forest.

The Cedar River Watershed provides habitat for a variety of wildlife. The river provides habitat for anadromous fish including Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, and Steelhead trout. Deforestation and associated erosion in the early 20th century resulted in a degraded habitat for wildlife. Starting in the late 20th century efforts began to be made to protect and restore the river and its watershed. Salmon runs have been a major topic of concern, with work underway to recreate spawning channels, proper salmon habitat zones, and fish ladders. To address low counts on the river, with only 10,000 counted beyond Lake Washington by the early 2020s, the Muckleshoot Tribe began trucking 1,500 spawning salmon from the Ballard Locks to the Cedar River.

<text>Reykjanesbær () is a municipality on the Southern Peninsula (&quot;Suðurnes&quot;) in Iceland, though the name is also used by locals to refer to the suburban region of Keflavík and Njarðvík which have grown together over the years. The municipality is made up of the towns of Keflavík and Njarðvík and the village of Hafnir. The municipality was created in 1994 when the inhabitants of the three settlements voted to merge them into one. Reykjanesbær is the fourth largest municipality in Iceland, with 21.957 citizens (2024).

==Overview==
Of the three towns which make up the municipality, Keflavík is the largest, while Hafnir is the smallest and some 10 kilometers distant. Keflavík and Njarðvík were originally distinct towns but gradually grew together over the course of the latter half of the 20th century, until the only thing separating them was a single street. The northern side of the street belonged to Keflavík and the southern side to Njarðvík. 
Since May 2009 the township of Njarðvík has been the location of the Viking World museum (&quot;Víkingaheimar&quot;).

In 2006, when the United States Navy closed Naval Air Station Keflavik, the site was taken over by the development agency Kadeco, and renamed Ásbrú. A university, Keilir, was founded and now Ásbrú houses the campuses of various educational institutions and also businesses, both newly founded and relocated to the site of the air base.

==Demographics==

Reykjanesbær is the most populous municipality in the Suðurnes region, the fourth most populous in Iceland, and the most populous outside of the Greater Reykjavík area. The municipality had a population of 18,920 on 1 January 2019; that is about 5.3% of the country&#x27;s population. The Suðurnes region, which includes Reykjanesbær and five neighbouring municipalities, was home to 27,113 people; that is about 7.6% of the country&#x27;s population.

On 1 January 2018, of the town&#x27;s population of 17,805, immigrants of the first and second generation numbered 4,352 (24.4%). 
The most common foreign citizens were Poles, Lithuanians, and Latvians.

<text>Showdown in Little Tokyo is a 1991 American buddy cop action film directed by Mark L. Lester and starring Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee; it was the latter&#x27;s first American film role. The film was released in the United States on August 23, 1991. It gained a cult following among action fans especially for the chemistry between Lundgren and Lee.

==Plot==
Los Angeles cop Chris Kenner (Dolph Lundgren) is an American who was raised in Japan. He is given a new partner, Johnny Murata (Brandon Lee), an American of partial Japanese descent. Kenner does not appreciate American culture, while Johnny does not like Japanese culture much. One thing they both enjoy are the martial arts, in which they are both experts. The two are assigned to L.A.&#x27;s Little Tokyo, where they break up some criminal activity in a Japanese restaurant, and an arrest is made. While Kenner and Johnny are questioning the suspect, Kenner notices that he has tattoos of the Iron Claw yakuza clan. This reminds him of when he was 9 years old and he witnessed his parents being killed by a member of the yakuza. Before Kenner or Murata can interrogate the suspect further, he kills himself in the interrogation room by breaking his own neck.

The leader of the Iron Claw clan, Yoshida (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), kills the owner of a popular downtown nightclub called the Bonsai Club by crushing the owner, Tanaka (Philip Tan), in a car compactor. To celebrate gaining ownership of the Bonsai Club, Yoshida throws a party at his house with all of the club staff. Yoshida discovers that one of the girls at the party, Angel (Renee Griffin), had warned Tanaka about Yoshida behind his back. Yoshida summons Angel to his office to question her about her loyalty, where she attempts to appease him by offering her body to him, but Yoshida instead drugs Angel and strips off her clothes before beheading her.

When the coroner runs an analysis on Angel&#x27;s body, it is revealed that the methamphetamines in her system would have led to her death anyway. This discovery of drugs, together with the suspect having yakuza tattoos, prompts Kenner and Johnny to go to the Bonsai Club in search of information. There they meet Angel&#x27;s close friend, lounge singer Minako Okeya (Tia Carrere). Whilst talking with Minako, Kenner and Johnny are ambushed and taken to see the nightclub&#x27;s owner and Kenner recognizes Yoshida as the man who killed his parents. Yoshida is now a drug manufacturer using a local brewery as his distribution center. He uses smaller gangs such as the Hells Angels, Crips and Sureños to peddle the drugs for him, in return for a percentage of the profit. Enraged, Kenner pulls his gun on Yoshida and almost kills him to avenge the death of his parents, but Johnny manages to defuse the situation and they both leave the nightclub.

Later that night, Yoshida rapes and kidnaps Minako and holds her hostage in his home and vows to kill Kenner. Kenner and Johnny set out for Yoshida&#x27;s heavily guarded home, where they rescue Minako. His pride wounded, Yoshida sends his men out to get Minako back. He has Kenner and Johnny captured, stripped topless and tortured by electrocution, however, the two manage to escape. They prepare for an assault on Yoshida&#x27;s brewery, where they rescue Minako once again. They chase Yoshida down to a parade being held in the middle of the city, where he and Kenner engage in a modern day samurai-like sword duel. The fight ends with Kenner overpowering Yoshida and impaling him through the abdomen before throwing him into a giant spinning Catherine wheel firework display, which burns Yoshida alive before exploding and killing him.

Kenner and Johnny are then hailed as heroes by the crowd as they escort Minako away from the scene.

==Production==
Lester says the film was taken over by the studio and recut without his involvement.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Warner Bros. was not happy with the film and re-edited it, only to give it a limited theatrical run in the United States, Mexico, Australia, France (where it skipped Paris), Italy, Israel and Hungary. Except for these markets, the film was released direct-to-video in 1992.

In the US opening weekend, the film grossed $455,192 from 140 theaters which was an average of $3,251 per theater. This accounted for 20% of the film&#x27;s total gross.

It ranked #9 in Hungary&#x27;s Top 10 of 1992 Overall Box Office Grosses (according to the 1994 &quot;Variety International Film Guide&quot;), grossing $197,590 in Hungary.

After Brandon Lee&#x27;s untimely death while filming &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), movies with Lee in leading roles, such as &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo,&quot; saw a surge in video sales.

The film became a cult classic among action fans after its release. Director Mark L. Lester said: “I was going for exaggerated reality. Kind of a pop art thing or a comic book. But Warner took about ten minutes out of the film, which were pretty good actually. They changed it all around. They didn’t do a big release, but I guess people liked it.“ Brandon Lee was also very fond of the movie: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a lot of input into it. It was really just a job for me but it was a good experience&quot;.

===Critical response===
The movie faced largely negative reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;violent, but spiritless.&quot; It holds a rating of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews, with an average score of 4.3/10.

==== Later reviews ====
Upon its 2015 DVD release, DVD Talk reviewer Ian Jane wrote that it was a shallow but highly enjoyable action film of its time. He found it fast paced, action packed, and funny. He felt it had good photography, nice locations, and that Brandon Lee shined in his role.

Contemporary critic Chris Coffel of Bloody Disgusting praised it for being a well-made action film of its time, and that both leads delivered their roles well. He also praised the lead villain Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Finally he felt the movie fell flat on the humorous side of things, but was great fun for its genre.

On JoBlo.com, writer Chris Bumbray considers it to be an underrated gem and a cult classic. He thinks that Lee steals the show from Lundgren and that the film showcases the range of the early departed actor. His final thought was that it was a fun B actioner.

The post office opened on 1 August 1856, after the first gold rush to the area commenced in 1852, but it was known as Korong until 1858. The railway arrived in 1883, linking Wedderburn with Charlton and Bendigo via Inglewood. In the &quot;Bendigo Advertiser&quot; of 14 May 1884 it was written: &quot;That well-known locality, Korong Vale, has been re-christened. It has been so determined in consequence of the confusion of names, there being a Korong (now Wedderburn), a Kerang, a Mount Korong, and the Korong Vale. The latter has now received the dignified lordly title of Rosebery or Rosebury, I know not which, but I am disposed to think that its new title will be more in the name than in the reality, and that the word &quot;Vale&quot; will still be generally used.&quot;

The Hand of Faith gold nugget, weighing over 27 kilograms was found at Kingower near Wedderburn in 1980. It was sold to the Gold Nugget Casino in Las Vegas for over a million dollars and is currently on display there. This discovery created another gold rush to the Wedderburn area, this time with metal detectors, not picks and shovels.

==Present day==
One of the main attractions for tourists is Hard Hill Reserve where, with a bit of imagination, one can feel a sense of what it was like in the &#x27;old days&#x27; living in tents on the goldfields. Apart from gold, a number of Eucalyptus stills used to operate in the district and a replica still has been situated on the site and is fired up, by arrangement, for tourist buses. On site is one of the original batteries for crushing the ore and removing the gold. A puddler is also on site and a demonstration of it working can be seen during the annual Detector Jamboree Festival held on the Labor Day long weekend each year.

Wedderburn is a popular spot for hopefuls with gold detectors who are still finding the occasional nice nugget.

Wedderburn has an older than average demographic. At the 2016 Census it had a population 940. The town today is predominantly farming based, though the town includes the head office for the local Shire Council (Loddon), a P-12 school servicing the needs of a number of surrounding towns and communities, a vibrant Community Centre housing a Tourist Information Centre and numerous community services, a Medical Centre and some manufacturing and service businesses.
The Donaldson Park Recreation Reserve in the centre of town is a feature of Wedderburn. It includes a football oval, netball courts, hockey field, trotting track, lawn bowling greens, tennis courts and a swimming pool.

Wedderburn has a football team, the Redbacks, competing in the North Central Football League. The team created a League record when from 2011 to 2014 they won four straight senior premierships. They also have reserves, under 16 and under 14 football teams, a successful Netball Club and a Hockey Club which also compete in the North Central League. In 2018 the football, netball and hockey clubs combined to form the Wedderburn Redbacks Inc.

Golfers play at the course of the Wedderburn Golf Club on Racecourse Road.

A must do if visiting Wedderburn is to stop at the impressive Soldiers Memorial Park in the centre of town. As part of its Commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac program, Loddon Shire Council has commissioned a magnificent bronze sculpture of two of the district&#x27;s most famous sons, World War One Victoria Cross recipients Albert Borella and Albert Jacka.

In 2015, Wedderburn won the right to host &quot;The Race that Slows Down the Nation&quot;, a horse-suit race held by radio personalities Hamish &amp; Andy. The race was held as a means to safely slow down the nation for the Melbourne Cup (which is often dubbed &quot;the race that stops the nation&quot;). The winner of the race, &quot;Hoof Hearted&quot;, won $2000 in prize money as well as a hamper that featured food and gifts from the Wedderburn region.

Wedderburn has a Visitor Radio Station which can be found at FM 87.6. At the top of the hour, it broadcasts an events bulletin which gives details of community events for the next month.

An increasing number of people are taking up lifestyle opportunities at Wedderburn and living on small rural allotments around the town. This effectively means that the town is larger than appears in census data.

==Notable people==
Albert Jacka, awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I, lived in Wedderburn from the age of four until he enlisted in 1914. He was the first Australian to be awarded the Victoria Cross in that war. He later became Mayor of St Kilda.

Albert Borella, another World War I Victoria Cross recipient, was born and raised at Borung, near Wedderburn.

William Jacka, brother of Albert and also raised in Wedderburn, was another notable World War I soldier. He went on to become Mayor of Footscray.

Australian rules football champion Cresswell &quot;Mickey&quot; Crisp was born and raised in Wedderburn. He played 183 games with Carlton in the Victorian Football League, winning two best and fairest awards, played in its 1938 premiership team and captained Victoria.

Keith Turnbull, a minister in the Bolte government in Victoria, was another product of Wedderburn.

<doc id="584718" wikidata="Q33584" url="?curid=584718" title="Khasi language">
<text>Khasi () is an Austroasiatic language with just over a million speakers in north-east India, primarily the Khasi people in the state of Meghalaya. It has associate official status in some districts of this state. The closest relatives of Khasi are the other languages in the Khasic group of the Shillong Plateau; these include Pnar, Lyngngam and War.

Khasi is written using the Latin script. In the first half of the 19th century, attempts to write Khasi in Bengali-Assamese script met with little success.

==Etymology==
==Geographic distribution and status==
Khasi is natively spoken by people in India (as of 2011). It is the first language of one-third of the population of Meghalaya, or , and its speakers are mostly found in the Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills regions. There are also small Khasi-speaking communities in neighbouring states of India, the largest of which is in Assam: people. There is also a very small number of speakers in Bangladesh.

Khasi has been an associate official language of some districts within Meghalaya since 2005, and as of 2012, was no longer considered endangered by UNESCO. There are demands to include this language to the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

A sizeable number of books have been published in Khasi, including novels, poetry, religious works, school textbooks and non-fiction. The most famous Khasi poet is U Soso Tham (1873–1940), whose death is commemorated annually as a regional holiday in the state of Meghalaya. Khasi has a good presence on the internet, including blogs and several online newspapers.

==Dialects==
Khasi has significant dialectal variation, and this presents a challenge with regard to classifying the Khasic languages.

Some dialects of Khasi include:
* Sohra Khasi
* Mylliem Khasi
* Mawlai Khasi
* Nongkrem Khasi
* War Khasi, not to be confused with the closely associated War language
* Bhoi Khasi
* Nonglung

In addition, Pnar, Maram (including Langrin) and Lyngngam have been listed as types of Khasi, although more recent studies seem to indicate that these are sister languages to Khasi, and that Khasi actually began as a marginal Pnar dialect.

Bhoi, from Nongpoh, and Nonglung from Umsning, in Ri Bhoi District, differ substantially from Standard Khasi in their word order. They are distinct enough from Standard Khasi to be sometimes considered separate languages, with Bhoi sometimes classified as intermediate between Khasi and Pnar, and Nonglung being part of Mnar, variously classified as a type of War or of Pnar. On the other hand, Sohra and War Khasi are lexically very similar.

The Sohra dialect is taken as Standard Khasi, as it was the first dialect to be written in Latin and Bengali scripts by the British. While Standard Khasi is spoken by majority in Shillong, it is in turn significantly different from the other Shillong dialects (eight at most) which form a dialect continuum across the capital region.

==Phonology==
This section discusses mainly the phonology of Standard Khasi as spoken in and around the capital city, Shillong.

Khasi, mainly spoken in Meghalaya, is surrounded by unrelated languages: Assamese to the north and east, Sylheti to the south (both Indo-Aryan languages), Garo (a Tibeto-Burman language) to the west, and a plethora of other Tibeto-Burman languages including Manipuri, Mizo and Bodo.

Although over the course of time, language change has occurred, Khasi retains some distinctive features:
* Khasi remains a stress language, without tones, unlike many of its Tibeto-Burman neighbors.
* Like its Mon-Khmer relatives, Khasi has a large inventory of phonemic vowels (see below)
* The syllable structure of Khasi words resembles that of many Mon-Khmer languages, with many lexical items showing a CCVC shape, in which many combinations of consonants are possible in the onset (see examples below).

===Consonants===


===Vowels===

==Script==

Before British colonization, some of the Khasi Syiems (Royals) used to keep official records and communicate with one another on paper primarily using the Bengali script. William Carey wrote the language with the Bengali script between 1813 and 1838. A large number of Khasi books were written in the Bengali script, including the famous book &quot;Ka Niyom Jong Ki Khasi&quot; or &quot;The Religion of the Khasis&quot;, which is an important work on the Khasi religion.

The Welsh missionary, Thomas Jones, arrived in Sohra on June 22, 1841, and proceeded to write down the local language in the Latin script. As a result, the modified Latin alphabet of the language has a few similarities with the Welsh alphabet. The first journal in Khasi was &quot;U Nongkit Khubor&quot; (The Messenger) published at Mawphlang in 1889 by William Williams.

===Khasi alphabet===
Khasi in Latin script has a different system, distinct from that of English. Khasi uses a 23-letter alphabet by removing the letters c, f, q, v, x and z from the basic Latin alphabet and adding the diacritic letters ï and ñ, and the digraph ng, which is treated as a letter in its own right. The diagraph ng is also present in Welsh alphabet.
===Pronunciation===
* Vowel length is not usually marked in the orthography, although it can be marked optionally by an acute accent (&quot;sim&quot; &quot;bird&quot; vs. &quot;rí &quot;country&quot;).
* The peculiar placement of &quot;k&quot; is due to it replacing &quot;c&quot;. &quot;c&quot; and &quot;ch&quot; were originally used in place of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;kh&quot;. When &quot;c&quot; was removed from the alphabet, &quot;k&quot; was put in its place.
* The inclusion of &quot;g&quot; is only due to its presence in the letter ng. It is not used independently in any word of native origin.
* &quot;h&quot; represents both the fricative sound as well as the glottal stop(ʔ) word-finally.
* &quot;y&quot; is not pronounced as in &quot;year&quot;, but acts as a schwa(ə), and as a glottal stop between vowels. The sound in &quot; year&quot; is written with &quot;ï&quot;.
===Digraphs===
Besides ng, which is considered a single letter in the alphabet, Khasi has 8 other digraphs:
* Aspirated consonants are represented by digraphs kh, ph and th.
* Breathy voiced consonants are represented by digraphs bh, dh and jh.
* The /ʃ/ in Khasi is written sh.
* The digraph ie represents the /e/ sound, as opposed to e, which represents the sound /ɛ/.
This digraphs are not treated as single letters but rather as combinations of letters.

===Lost Khasi Script===

A local legend tells of how the Khasi people received their script from God, and that subsequently the Khasi people lost their script in a great flood. In 2017, it was reported that there is evidence of an undeciphered script, currently stored at the Kamarupa Anusandhan Samity Library in Guwahati, Assam, that is considered to be Khasi in origin.

==Grammar==
Khasi is an Austroasiatic language and has its distinct features of a large number of consonant conjuncts, with prefixing and infixing.

===Nouns and noun phrases===

====Word order====
The order of elements in a Khasi noun phrase is
(Case marker)-(Demonstrative)-(Numeral)-(Classifier)-(Article)-Noun-(Adjective)-(Prepositional phrase)-(Relative clause), as can be seen from the following examples:



====Gender====
Khasi has a pervasive gender system. There are four genders in this language:

Humans and domestic animals have their natural gender:

: &quot;mother&quot;
: &quot;father&quot;
: &quot;hen&quot;
: &quot;rooster&quot;

Rabel (1961) writes: &quot;the structure of a noun gives no indication of its gender, nor does its meaning, but Khasi natives are of the impression that nice, small creatures and things are feminine while big, ugly creatures and things are masculine...This impression is not borne out by the facts. There are countless examples of desirable and lovely creatures with masculine gender as well as of unpleasant or ugly creatures with feminine gender&quot;

Though there are several counterexamples, Rabel says that there is some semantic regularity in the assignment of gender for the following semantic classes:

The matrilineal aspect of the society can also be observed in the general gender assignment, where so, all central and primary resources associated with day-to-day activities are signified as Feminine; whereas Masculine signifies the secondary, the dependent or the insignificant.

Note: However do note that there are no such universal rules for gender assignment of nouns in Khasi. There are a lot of exceptions and one such is which is stereotypically considered feminine but is accompanied with masculine gender signifier &quot;u&quot; i.e. . This gender assignment to nouns is highly depended on what the native speakers assign the noun which they all naturally agree upon but which can vary sometimes like according to the mood or tone.

====Classifiers====
Khasi has a classifier system, apparently used only with numerals. Between the numeral and noun, the classifier &quot;tylli&quot; is used for non-humans, and the classifier &quot;ngut&quot; is used for humans, e.g.

===Adjectives===
There is some controversy about whether Khasi has a class of adjectives. Roberts cites examples like the following:

In nearly all instances of attributive adjectives, the apparent adjective has the prefix /ba-/, which seems to be a relativiser. There are, however, a few adjectives without the /ba-/ prefix:

When the adjective is the main predicate, it may appear without any verb &#x27;be&#x27;:

In this environment, the adjective is preceded by an agreement marker, like a verb. Thus it may be that Khasi does not have a separate part of speech for adjectives, but that they are a subtype of verb.

===Prepositions and prepositional phrases===
Khasi appears to have a well-developed group of prepositions, among them
* &quot;with, and&quot;
* &quot;with (instrumental)&quot;
* &quot;from&quot;
* &quot;in, at&quot;
* &quot;in, at&quot;
* &quot;of&quot;

The following are examples of prepositional phrases:

===Verbs and verb phrases===

====Agreement====
Verbs agree with 3rd person subjects in gender, but there is no agreement for non-3rd persons (Roberts 1891):
The masculine and feminine markers /u/ and /ka/ are used even when there is a noun phrase subject (Roberts 1891:132):

====Tense marking====
Tense is shown through a set of particles that appear after the agreement markers but before the verb. Past is a particle /la/ and future is /yn/ (contracted to &#x27;n after a vowel):
====Negation====
Negation is also shown through a particle, /ym/ (contracted to &#x27;m after a vowel), which appears between the agreement and the tense particle. There is a special past negation particle /shym/ in the past which replaces the ordinary past /la/ (Roberts 1891):

====Copulas====
The copula is an ordinary verb in Khasi, as in the following sentence:

====Causative verbs====
Khasi has a morphological causative /pn-/ (Rabel 1961). (This is spelled &quot;pyn&quot; in Roberts (1891)):

===Sentences===

====Word order====
Word order in simple sentences is subject–verb–object (SVO):

However, VSO order is also found, especially after certain initial particles, like hangta &#x27;then&#x27; (Rabel 1961).

====Case marking====
Sometimes the object is preceded by a particle ya (spelled ia in Roberts 1891). Roberts says &quot;ia, &#x27;to&#x27;, &#x27;for&#x27;, &#x27;against&#x27; implies direct and immediate relation. Hence its being the sign of the dative and of the accusative case as well&quot;

It appears from Roberts (1891) that Khasi has differential object marking, since only some objects are marked accusative. Roberts notes that nouns that are definite usually have the accusative and those that are indefinite often do not.

Rabel (1961) says &quot;the use of ïa is optional in the case of one object. In the case of two objects one of them must have ïa preceding... If one of the objects is expressed by a pronoun, it must be preceded by ïa.&quot;

Broadly speaking, Khasi marks for eight cases, with the nominative case remaining unmarked, for a total of nine cases.

All case markers can appear with or without the prenominal markers/articles , , and , and are placed before the prenominal markers.

====Passive====
Khasi has a passive, but it involves removing the agent of the sentence without putting the patient in subject position. (A type called the &#x27;non-ascensional passive&#x27;). Compare the following active-passive pair (Roberts 1891) where the patient continues to have accusative case and remains in the object position:

This type of passive is used, even when the passive agent is present in a prepositional phrase:

{{interlinear|lang=kha|indent=3
|La lah pyniap ïa ka masi da {U Míet}.
|PAST PFV kill ACC FEM cow by {{{no gloss|U}} Miet}
|&#x27;The cow was killed by U Miet.&#x27;}}

====Questions====
Yes–no questions seem to be distinguished from statements only by intonation:

{{interlinear|lang=kha|indent=3
|Phi kit khoh Til?
|you {are carrying} {a basket} Til?
|&#x27;Will you take a basket, Til? Phin shim ka khoh, Til?}}

Wh-questions don&#x27;t involve moving the wh-element:

{{interlinear|lang=kha|indent=3
|u leit shaei?
|MASC go where
|Where is he going?&#x27;}}

====Embedded clauses====
Subordinate clauses follow the main verb that selects them (Roberts 1891:169):

{{interlinear|lang=kha|indent=3
|Nga tip ba phi la leh ia kata.
|I know that you PAST do ACC that
|&#x27;I know that you have done that&#x27;}}

Relative clauses follow the nouns that they modify and agree in gender:

{{interlinear|lang=kha|indent=3
|Ka {samla kynthei} ka-ba wan mynhynnin ka la iáp.
|FEM girl FEM-relative come yesterday FEM PAST die
|&#x27;The girl who came yesterday has died.&#x27;}}

===Contractions and other reduced forms===

====Contractions====
A variety of Khasi prepositions and other words are contracted or reduced both in spoken and written language. One of the most common form of contractions is when a {{lang|kha|pronoun}} is grouped with the verbs &quot;{{lang|kha|yn}}&quot; or &quot;{{lang|kha|ym}}&quot; (for e.g. {{lang|kha|u yn}} contracts to {{lang|kha|u&#x27;n}}). Or when a preposition is grouped with a vowel-like gender identifier such as &quot;{{lang|kha|u}}&quot; and &quot;{{lang|kha|i}}&quot; (for e.g. {{lang|kha|ha u}} contracts to {{lang|kha|h&#x27;u}}).

====Reduced words====

Reduced form of words are common in the Khasi language. Most of the time, one or a couple of letters are dropped at the beginning of a word (for e.g. briew can become &#x27;riew). There&#x27;s no clear rule behind this process but usually these words that undergo reduction begins with more than one consonants; the reduced word is accompanied by an apostrophe from the start to mark so. The reduced form of the word is still understood by its context of usage and since its last inner syllabus and letters (i.e. {{lang|kha|rhyme}}) are always preserved.
These reduced forms of words are mostly seen in compound forms where the reduced word is affixed with other words to give rise to new words with new meanings. In compound form, the apostrophe is not used anymore. For e.g. &#x27;riew as in riewkhlaw, riewspah, riewhyndai etc.

<doc id="584728" wikidata="Q830740" url="?curid=584728" title="The Tale of the Heike">
<text>is an epic account compiled prior to 1330 of the struggle between the Taira clan and Minamoto clan for control of Japan at the end of the 12th century in the Genpei War (1180–1185).

It has been translated into English at least five times. The first translation was by Arthur Lindsay Sadler, in 1918–1921. A complete translation in nearly 800 pages by Hiroshi Kitagawa &amp; Bruce T. Tsuchida was published in 1975. It was also translated by Helen McCullough in 1988. An abridged translation by Burton Watson was published in 2006. In 2012, Royall Tyler completed his translation, which, he says, seeks to be mindful of the performance style for which the work was originally intended.

Historical novelist Eiji Yoshikawa published a prose rendering in the &quot;Asahi Weekly&quot; in 1950, under the title &quot;&quot; (&quot;Shin Heike Monogatari&quot;).

==Background==
===Title===
Heike () refers to the Taira (), &quot;hei&quot; being the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; reading of the first &quot;kanji&quot; and &quot;ke&quot; () meaning &quot;family&quot;. However, in the term &quot;the Genpei War&quot; &quot;hei&quot; is read as &quot;pei&quot; and the &quot;gen&quot; () is the first kanji in &quot;Genji&quot; the alternative name for the Minamoto clan.

===Authorship===
&quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;″s origin cannot be reduced to a single creator. Like most epics (the work is an epic chronicle in prose rather than verse), it is the result of the conglomeration of differing versions passed down through an oral tradition by biwa-playing bards known as &quot;biwa hōshi&quot;.

The monk Yoshida Kenkō (1282–1350) offers a theory as to the authorship of the text in his famous work &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot;, which he wrote in 1330. According to Kenkō, &quot;The former governor of Shinano, Yukinaga, wrote and told it to a blind man called Shōbutsu to chant it&quot;. He also confirms the biwa connection of that blind man, who &quot;was natural from the eastern tract&quot;, and who was sent from Yukinaga to &quot;recollect some information about samurai, about their bows, their horses and their war strategy. Yukinaga wrote it after that&quot;.

One of the key points in this theory is that the book was written in a difficult combination of Chinese and Japanese (&quot;wakan konkō shō&quot;), which in those days was mastered only by educated monks and nobles, such as Yukinaga. However, in the end, as the tale is the result of a long oral tradition, there is no single true author; Yukinaga is only one possibility of being the first to compile this masterpiece into a written form. Moreover, as it is true that there are frequent steps back, and that the style is not the same throughout the composition, this cannot mean anything but that it is a collective work.

==Origin and themes==
The story of the Heike was compiled from a collection of oral stories recited by travelling monks who chanted to the accompaniment of the biwa, an instrument reminiscent of the lute. The most widely read version of the &quot;Heike monogatari&quot; was compiled by a blind monk named Kakuichi, in 1371. The &quot;Heike&quot; is considered one of the great classics of Medieval Japanese literature. 

Two main strands feed into the central ethos of the tale, samurai and buddhist. 

At one level, the Tale is an account of martial heroism – of courage, cruelty, power, glory, sacrifice and sorrow. Those who emphasise this aspect of the story point to its glorification of the heroic spirit, its avoidance of the realistic brutality and squalor of war, and its aestheticisation of death: a classic instance of the latter is the comparison of the drowned samurai in the final battle to a maple-leaf brocade upon the waves.

Others, while still accepting the importance of the military episodes and of heroic figures like Yoshitsune, would emphasise instead the Tale’s immersion in Buddhist thought, and its themes of duty, Dharma, and fate. Announced at the very beginning is the Buddhist law of transience and impermanence, specifically in the form of the fleeting nature of fortune, an analog of &quot;sic transit gloria mundi&quot;. The theme of impermanence (&quot;mujō&quot;) is captured in the famous opening passage:–

The is a phrase from the &quot;Humane King Sutra,&quot; in full .

The second religious concept evident in the &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot; is another Buddhist idea, karma. The concept of karma says that every action has consequences that become apparent later in life. Thus, karma helps to deal with the problem of both moral and natural evil. Evil acts in life will bring about an inevitable suffering later in life. This can be seen clearly with the treatment of Kiyomori in &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, who is cruel throughout his life, and later falls into a painful illness that kills him.

===Focus, divisions and influence===

The Buddhist theme of impermanence in the Heike is epitomised in the fall of the powerful Taira – the samurai clan who defeated the imperial-backed Minamoto in 1161. The Taira warrior family sowed the seeds of their own destruction with acts of arrogance and pride that led to their defeat in 1185 at the hands of the revitalized Minamoto, and the first establishment of samurai government (Kamakura shogunnate).

The story is episodic in nature and designed to be told in a series of nightly instalments. While tinged with Buddhism, it is also a samurai epic focusing on warrior culture – an ideology that ultimately laid the groundwork for bushido (the way of the warrior). The Heike also includes a number of love stories, which harken back to earlier Heian literature.

The story is roughly divided into three sections. The central figure of the first section is Taira no Kiyomori who is described as arrogant, evil, ruthless and so consumed by the fires of hatred that even in death his feverish body does not cool when immersed in water. The main figure of the second section is the Minamoto general Minamoto no Yoshinaka. After he dies the main figure of the third section is the great samurai, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, a military genius who is falsely accused of treachery by his politically astute elder brother Minamoto no Yoritomo.

The &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot; has provided material for many later artistic works ranging from Noh plays and Kabuki plays, to woodblock prints, paintings and haiku; and is also referenced in modern works.

==&quot;Monogatari&quot; historiography==
The Japangol have developed a number of complementary strategies for capturing, preserving and disseminating the essential elements of their commonly-accepted national history – chronicles of sovereigns and events, biographies of eminent persons and personalities, and the military tale or &quot;gunki monogatari&quot;. This last form evolved from an interest in recording the activities of military conflicts in the late 12th century. The major battles, the small skirmishes and the individual contests (and the military figures who animate these accounts) have all been passed from generation to generation in the narrative formats of &quot;The Tale of Hōgen&quot; (1156), &quot;The Tale of Heiji&quot; (1159–1160), and the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot; (1180–1185).

In each of these familiar &quot;monogatari&quot;, the central figures are popularly well known, the major events are generally understood, and the stakes as they were understood at the time are conventionally accepted as elements in the foundation of Japanese culture. The accuracy of each of these historical records has become a compelling subject for further study; and some accounts have been shown to withstand, while other presumed &quot;facts&quot; have turned out to be inaccurate.

The most prevalent and well known edition of the &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot; today, the 1371 Kakuichi text, is generally thought to be a fictional dramatization of the Genpei War. Rather than focusing on the Genpei warriors as they actually were, but rather upon the &quot;... ideal warrior as conceived by oral singers ...&quot; it serves as an account of glorified conduct as a source of inspiration.

==Extension==
The &quot;Genpei Jōsuiki&quot;, also known as the , is a 48-book extended version of the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;.

==Plot==

===Chapter 1===
The two main themes are set in the famous introduction (the bells of the Gion Shōja): impermanence and the fall of the mighty (Taira no Kiyomori).

The chapter describes the rise of the Taira clan and early conflicts at the court. The first Taira who gets access to the Imperial court is Taira no Tadamori (1131). After Tadamori&#x27;s death (1153), his son Kiyomori plays a key role in helping the Emperor Go-Shirakawa suppress the Hōgen rebellion (1156) and the Heiji rebellion (1159), thereby gaining more influence in the court affairs. The Taira clan members occupy major government positions, Kiyomori&#x27;s daughter becomes the Emperor&#x27;s wife, and more than half of all the provinces are under their control.

One of the episodes describing Kiyomori&#x27;s arrogance is the famous story about the dancer Giō who falls out of Kiyomori&#x27;s favour and becomes a nun.

Kiyomori and the Taira even dare to conflict with the powerful Regent, Fujiwara no Motofusa. Angered by the Taira dominance, Major Counselor Fujiwara no Narichika, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa, Buddhist monk Saikō and others meet at Shishigatani (the villa of the temple administrator Shunkan) and plot a conspiracy to overthrow Kiyomori. Because of the conflict between Saikō&#x27;s sons and sōhei of Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei, the plot has to be postponed. The great fire of May 27, 1177 burns the Imperial Palace in the capital, of Heian-kyō.

===Chapter 2===
In 1177, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa is in conflict with Enryaku-ji. Hearing a rumor about a possible attack on Enryaku-ji, one of the Shishi-no-tani conspirators informs Taira no Kiyomori of the plot. The monk Saikō is executed and others are exiled. Kiyomori is angered by the participation of the Retired Emperor in the plot and prepares to arrest him. Taira no Shigemori, the eldest virtuous son of Kiyomori, successfully admonishes his father by reminding him of the Confucian value of loyalty to the Emperor. Major Counselor Fujiwara no Narichika is exiled to an island and cruelly executed. Other conspirators (Naritsune, Yasuyori and Shunkan) are exiled to Kikaijima near Satsuma Province.

Meanwhile, the Enryaku-ji complex is destroyed and a fire at the Zenkō-ji destroys a Buddhist statue. People believe these troubles to be signs of the Taira decline. Those exiled to Kikaijima build a shrine where they pray for return to capital. They make a thousand stupas (Buddhist wooden objects) with their names and throw them into the sea. One of the pieces reaches the shore. It is brought to the capital and shown to Yasuyori&#x27;s family. The news reaches Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa and Kiyomori who see the stupa with emotion.

===Chapter 3===
The illness of Kiyomori&#x27;s pregnant daughter, Taira no Tokuko, is attributed to angry spirits of the executed (such as Fujiwara no Narichika) and the exiled. Taira no Kiyomori, interested in becoming a grandfather of the Imperial prince, agrees to a general amnesty. Fujiwara no Narichika&#x27;s son Naritsune and Yasuyori are pardoned, but Shunkan is left alone on Kikaijima for letting the anti-Taira conspirators gather at his villa. A famous tragic scene follows when Shunkan beats his feet on the ground in despair.

Kiyomori&#x27;s daughter Tokuko gives birth to the future Emperor Antoku (1178). A loyal youth in service of Shunkan, Ariō, journeys to the island finding Shunkan barely alive. Hearing the news of his family&#x27;s death, Shunkan kills himself by fasting (1179). His suffering as well as the whirlwind that strikes the capital are seen as signs of the fall of the Taira.

Kiyomori&#x27;s virtuous son, Taira no Shigemori, goes on a pilgrimage to Kumano and asks the gods for a quick death if the Taira are to fall. In a short while, he falls ill and dies. Without Shigemori&#x27;s restraining influence, Kiyomori is close to open war with Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. He leads soldiers to Kyoto where he exiles or dismisses 43 top court officials (including Regent Fujiwara no Motofusa). Next, Kiyomori imprisons Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the desolate Seinan palace (1179).

===Chapter 4===
Emperor Takakura is forced to retire and Emperor Antoku, Kiyomori&#x27;s grandson, age 3, becomes the new Emperor. Retired Emperor Takakura angers the monks of Enryaku-ji by going to the Itsukushima Shrine instead of the Enryaku-ji. Minamoto no Yorimasa persuades Prince Mochihito, the second son of Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa, to lead Minamoto forces against the Taira and become the Emperor. Prince Mochihito issues an anti-Taira call to arms. The open conflict between the Minamoto and the Taira is triggered by Kiyomori&#x27;s son Taira no Munemori humiliating Minamoto no Yorimasa&#x27;s son by taking away his horse and calling it by the owner&#x27;s name.

Taira no Kiyomori discovers the anti-Taira plot. Prince Mochihito avoids arrest by fleeing from the capital to Miidera. Yorimasa and the Miidera monks fight with Taira forces at the bridge over the Uji River (1180). Despite bravery of the monks, Taira forces cross the river and win the battle. Yorimasa commits suicide in the Byōdōin temple and Prince Mochihito is killed on the way to the allied Kōfuku-ji in Nara. One of the Prince Mochihito&#x27;s sons is forced to become a monk, but the other son flees north to join the Minamoto forces. Kiyomori gives orders to burn the Miidera temple. Many temples are burned and people see it as a bad omen for the Taira.

===Chapter 5===
Kiyomori moves the capital from Kyoto to his stronghold Fukuhara-kyō in 1180. Strange ghosts appear to Kiyomori (a face, laughter, skulls, ominous dreams). News of unrest in the eastern provinces (controlled by the Minamoto) reaches the new capital.

A story about the monk Mongaku is inserted as a background to Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s revolt. Mongaku is an ascetic with strange powers who requested donations at the court in 1179. After the refusal of Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa he caused trouble at the court and was exiled to Izu Province.

At Izu, Mongaku convinces Minamoto no Yoritomo to revolt against the Taira. Then he goes to Fukuhara and brings back the Imperial Edict from Go-Shirakawa permitting Minamoto no Yoritomo to overthrow the Taira. Kiyomori sends a military expedition to put down the rebellion of Yoritomo. When they reach the Fuji River, the Taira forces hear stories about the might of eastern warriors and fear that Minamoto forces outnumber them. At night, a flock of birds rises with great noise and the Taira forces, thinking that they are attacked, retreat in panic.

Kiyomori, under pressure from temples and courtiers, moves the capital back to Kyoto. Upon hearing the rumours of an attack being planned by the Taira, monks of the Kōfukuji temple (who supported the rebellion of Prince Mochihito) revolt and kill messengers sent by Kiyomori. Taira forces lay siege to Nara and burn many important temples (Tōdai-ji, Kōfuku-ji), statues and Buddhist texts. Retired Emperors and courtiers lament the destruction of Nara. This evil deed is believed to lead to Kiyomori&#x27;s downfall.

===Chapter 6===
In 1181, Retired Emperor Takakura dies, troubled by the events of the last several years. Kiso no Yoshinaka (cousin of Minamoto no Yoritomo in the northwestern provinces) plans a rebellion against the Taira and raises an army. Messengers bring news of anti-Taira forces gathering under the Minamoto leadership in the eastern provinces, Kyūshū, Shikoku. The Taira have trouble dealing with all the rebellions.

To make things worse for the Taira, their leader, Taira no Kiyomori, falls ill. His body is hot as fire and no water can cool him. Water sprayed on his body turns to flames and black smoke that fills the room. Kiyomori&#x27;s wife has a dream about a carriage in flames that will take Kiyomori to Hell for burning Buddhist statues in the Tōdai-ji. Before dying in agony, Kiyomori makes a wish to have the head of Minamoto no Yoritomo hung before his grave. His death (in 1181, age 64) highlights the themes of impermanence and fall of the mighty. Kiyomori&#x27;s evil deeds will become his torturers in Hell. His fame and power turned to smoke and dust.

In the east, Taira forces are successful in some battles, but are not able to defeat the Minamoto forces. Divine forces punish and kill the governor appointed by Kiyomori to put down Kiso no Yoshinaka&#x27;s rebellion. Kiso no Yoshinaka wins a major battle at Yokotagawara (1182). Taira no Munemori, the leader of the Taira clan, is conferred a high rank in the court administration.

===Chapter 7===
In 1183, the Taira gather a large army (mainly from western provinces) and send it against Minamoto no Yoshinaka and Minamoto no Yoritomo. Going north, Taira armies pillage local villages. Taira no Tsunemasa visits an island to pray and compose a poem. At the Siege of Hiuchi, the Taira get help from a loyal abbot and defeat Yoshinaka&#x27;s garrisons. Yoshinaka writes a petition at the Hachiman Shrine to get divine help for the upcoming battle. Yoshinaka attacks the Taira armies at night from the front and rear and forces them to retreat and descend to the Kurikara Valley, where most of the 70,000 Taira riders are crushed piling up in many layers (a famous &quot;descent into Kurikara&quot; – a major victory of Yoshinaka). At Shio-no-yama, Yoshinaka helps his uncle Yoshiie to defeat the Taira forces (Kiyomori&#x27;s son Tomonori is killed in the battle). Taira armies are also defeated in the Battle of Shinohara. Yoshinaka wins Mount Hiei monks over to his side.

Taira no Munemori, head of the Taira, flees to the western provinces with Emperor Antoku and the Imperial Regalia (Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa manages to escape in a different direction). Taira no Tadanori (Kiyomori&#x27;s brother) flees the capital leaving some of his poems to a famous poet Fujiwara no Shunzei. Tsunemasa returns a famous lute to the Ninna-ji. At Fukuhara-kyō, Munemori gives a moving speech about duty to follow the Emperor, the Taira set fire to the palace and then flee from Fukuhara-kyō by boats to Kyūshū.

===Chapter 8===
Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa returns to the capital from Enryaku-ji together with Minamoto no Yoshinaka&#x27;s armies. He installs a new emperor, Emperor Go-Toba, and puts the Taira out of government positions (they are designated as rebels).

The Taira want to set up a new capital in Kyūshū, but have to flee from local warriors who take the side of the Retired Emperor. They arrive to Yashima in Shikoku where they have to live in humble huts instead of palaces.

In late 1183, Minamoto no Yoritomo (still in Kamakura) is appointed by the Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa as a &quot;barbarian-subduing commander&quot; (shōgun). Yoritomo receives the messenger from the capital with great courtesy, invites him to a feast and gives him many gifts. Yoritomo&#x27;s manners sharply contrast with Minamoto no Yoshinaka&#x27;s arrogant behaviour in the capital. Yoshinaka&#x27;s rudeness and lack of knowledge about etiquette are shown to be ridiculous in several episodes (makes fun of courtiers, wears tasteless hunting robes, does not know how to get out of a carriage).

Meanwhile, the Taira regain their strength and assemble a strong army. Yoshinaka sends forces against them, but this time the Taira are victorious in the battle of Mizushima. Their influence grows even more after the victory at the Battle of Muroyama.

In the capital, Yoshinaka fights with Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa (the battle at the Hōjūji) and takes control of the capital and the court by force. Minamoto no Yoritomo sends Minamoto no Yoshitsune to put an end to Yoshinaka&#x27;s excesses.

===Chapter 9===
When Minamoto no Yoshinaka prepares to march west against the Taira (early 1184), armies led by Minamoto no Yoshitsune arrive to strike him from the east. The struggle between the Minamoto forces follows. Yoshinaka tries to defend the capital, but Yoshitsune&#x27;s warriors succeed in crossing the Uji River and defeating Yoshinaka&#x27;s forces at Uji and Seta. Yoshitsune takes control of the capital and guards the mansion of the Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa, not letting Yoshinaka&#x27;s men capture him. Yoshinaka barely breaks through the enemy forces. He meets with his foster-brother Imai Kanehira and they try to escape from pursuing enemy forces. In a famous scene, Yoshinaka is killed when his horse is stuck in the muddy field. Kanehira fights his last battle and commits suicide.

While the Minamoto fight among themselves in the capital, the Taira move back to Fukuhara and set up defences at the Ichi-no-tani stronghold (near what is now Suma-ku, Kobe). Minamoto no Yoshitsune&#x27;s armies move west to attack the Taira from the rear whereas his half-brother Noriyori advances to attack the Taira camp from the east. Yoshitsune, planning a surprise attack on Ichi-no-tani from the west, follows an old horse that guides his forces through the mountains.

Meanwhile, fierce fighting starts at Ikuta-no-mori and Ichi-no-tani, but neither side is able to gain a decisive advantage. Yoshitsune&#x27;s cavalry descends a steep slope at Hiyodori Pass decisively attacking the Taira from the rear. The Taira panic and flee to the boats. As the battle continues, Taira no Tadanori (Kiyomori&#x27;s brother who visited the poet Shunzei) is killed. Taira no Shigehira (Kiyomori&#x27;s son who burned Nara), deserted by his men at Ikuta-no-mori, is captured alive trying to commit suicide.

In a famous passage, Taira no Atsumori (young nephew of Kiyomori) is challenged to a fight by a warrior, Kumagai Naozane. Naozane overpowers him, but then hesitates to kill him since he reminds him of his own young son. Seeing the approaching riders who are going to kill the youth, Naozane kills Atsumori, and finds his flute (later he becomes a Buddhist monk). The Taira are defeated and flee by boats in different directions.

===Chapter 10===
In 1184, Taira no Shigehira (captured alive) and the heads of the defeated Taira are paraded in the streets of the capital. The Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa offers the Taira to exchange Three Imperial Treasures for Shigehira, but they refuse. It is clear that he will be executed. Shigehira, concerned about his past arrogance and evil deeds (burning of Nara temples), wants to devote himself to Buddhism. Hōnen (the founder of the Pure Land Buddhism in Japan) concisely outlines the essential doctrines (reciting Amida&#x27;s name, repentance, deep faith guarantee rebirth in the Pure Land). Shigehira is sent to Kamakura. On his journey along the Eastern Sea Road, Shigehira passes numerous places that evoke historical and literary associations.

Minamoto no Yoritomo receives Shigehira, who claims that burning Nara temples was an accident. Before being sent to the Nara monks, Shigehira is treated well at Izu (a bath is prepared for him, wine is served, a beautiful lady serving Yoritomo, Senju-no-mae, sings several songs (with Buddhist meaning) and plays the lute; Shigehira also sings and plays the lute – after Shigehira&#x27;s execution, Senju-no-mae becomes a nun).

At Yashima, Taira no Koremori, grandson of Taira no Kiyomori, is grieved to be away from his family in the capital. He secretly leaves Yashima and travels to Mt. Kōya. There he meets with a holy man, Takiguchi Tokiyori.

A story of his tragic love is inserted: as a courtier, Tokiyori loved a girl of lesser birth, Yokobue. His father was against their marriage and Tokiyori became a monk. When Yokobue came looking for him, he was firm and did not come out. He went to Mt. Kōya and became a respected priest Takiguchi. Yokobue became a nun and died soon. Koremori comes to this priest, becomes a monk himself and goes on a pilgrimage to Kumano. After the priest&#x27;s encouraging Pure Land Buddhist teachings, Koremori abandons his attachments, throws himself into the sea and drowns. News of his death reaches Yashima (Taira camp). The Taira are attacked at Fujito and retreat.

===Chapter 11===
In 1185, a small force led by Minamoto no Yoshitsune lands on the island of Shikoku. Yoshitsune plans a surprise attack from the rear (one more time after the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani) on the Taira stronghold at the Battle of Yashima. The Taira, thinking that main Minamoto forces attack them, flee to their boats in panic. The Taira warriors shoot arrows at the Yoshitsune&#x27;s forces. Taira no Noritsune, Kiyomori&#x27;s nephew and a commander of the Taira, shoots at Minamoto no Yoshitsune, but Tsuginobu, Yoshitsune&#x27;s retainer, dies protecting him from arrows.

In a famous passage, a Taira lady in a boat holds a fan as a challenge to the Minamoto warriors and Nasu no Yoichi, a skillful young Minamoto archer, hits the fan with his arrow.

During the confused fighting at the shore, Yoshitsune loses his bow and gets it back risking his life. He famously explains that he did not want the Taira to get that bow (for weak archers) and laugh at him. The Taira are forced to leave Shikoku and retreat to Nagato Province (southern tip of Honshū).

Before the final Battle of Dan-no-ura, the Minamoto gain new allies: the head of the Kumano shrines decides to support the Minamoto after fortune-telling with cockfights (200 boats) and 150 boats from a province of Shikoku. In total, the Minamoto have about 3000 vessels against the Taira&#x27;s 1000.

Before the battle, Yoshitsune argues (about leading the attack) and almost fights with Kajiwara Kagetoki (Minamoto commander jealous of Yoshitsune).

As the battle begins, the Taira are in good spirits and seem to be winning due to skillful positioning of archers on the boats. After the exchange of arrows from a distance main forces begin fighting. Omens from Heaven (white banner descends on a Minamoto boat, many dolphins swim to Taira boats) show that the Minamoto are going to win. Taguchi Shigeyoshi from Awa Province in Shikoku betrays the Taira and informs the Minamoto about the boats carrying the main Taira forces in disguise. Warriors from Shikoku and Kyūshū also switch sides and support the Minamoto.

In the famous and tragic passage, Kiyomori&#x27;s widow, holding young Emperor Antoku in her arms, commits suicide by drowning. Many Taira are killed or commit suicide at Dan-no-ura. Tomomori (Kiyomori&#x27;s son) drowns himself. Taira no Noritsune, Kiyomori&#x27;s nephew and a strong warrior, fails to have a fight with Minamoto no Yoshitsune and dies fighting bravely. Taira clan head Taira no Munemori, Taira no Tokuko, Kiyomori&#x27;s daughter, are captured alive.

After the battle, Yoshitsune returns to capital with the Imperial Treasures (the sacred sword has been lost) and prisoners. Captured Taira are paraded along the streets of the capital with many spectators pitying their fate. Yoshitsune delivers Munemori to Minamoto no Yoritomo in Kamakura, but after Kajiwara Kagetoki&#x27;s slander, Yoritomo suspects Yoshitsune of treachery and does not allow him to enter Kamakura. Minamoto no Yoshitsune writes the Letter from Koshigoe listing his military deeds and loyal service. Yoritomo still sends him back to the capital. Taira no Munemori and his son Kiyomune are executed, their heads hung near a prison gate in the capital.

Taira no Shigehira (Taira no Kiyomori&#x27;s son captured at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani) is allowed to see his wife before being handed over to Nara monks. Shigehira hopes for Amitābha&#x27;s compassion and rebirth in Sukhavati, the pure land of Amitābha. Warriors execute him in front of the monks. His head is nailed near the temple at Nara. His wife becomes a nun after cremating his head and body.

===Chapter 12===
A powerful earthquake strikes the capital. Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s distrust of Minamoto no Yoshitsune grows. Yoritomo sends an assassin to kill Yoshitsune (fails). Then, Yoritomo kills Minamoto no Noriyori (Yoshitsune&#x27;s half brother) who is reluctant to go against Yoshitsune. When Yoritomo sends a large force led by Hōjō Tokimasa against him, Yoshitsune flees from the capital to a northern province.

Taking control of the capital, Tokimasa executes all potential heirs to the Taira family. An informer shows the cloister where Koremori&#x27;s family (including Rokudai) is hiding. Rokudai (age 12) is the last male heir of the Taira family. Rokudai is arrested, but his nurse finds Mongaku (the monk – see Ch.5), who agrees to go to Kamakura to ask for a pardon. Mongaku comes back with a letter from Yoritomo and saves Rokudai just before his execution takes place. Yoritomo has doubts about Rokudai and he is compelled to become a monk (1189, age 16). Rokudai visits Mt. Kōya and Kumano (where his father Koremori drowned).

Meanwhile, several Taira clan members are found and executed. In 1192, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa dies (age 66). Yoritomo (still suspicious) orders the execution of Rokudai (age 30+), and the Taira line comes to an end.

After Yoritomo&#x27;s death in 1199, the monk Mongaku plans a rebellion to install a prince on the throne. His plot is uncovered and the Retired Emperor Go-Toba exiles him to the island of Oki (age 80+).

===The Initiates&#x27; Book===

In 1185, Taira no Tokuko becomes a nun and moves to an old hut near the capital. Her life is filled with sadness as memories of the past glory haunt her. After the 1185 earthquake the hut is ruined.

In the autumn of 1185, Taira no Tokuko moves to a remote Buddhist retreat at Jakkō-in in the Ohara mountains to avoid public attention. There she devotes herself to Buddhist practices. Natural sights evoke images of Sukhavati and impermanence in her mind.

In the spring of 1186, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa makes a visit to the mountain retreat. She talks with the Retired Emperor about human miseries and Buddhist ideas of suffering and rebirth in the pure land.

As she remembers past glory of the Taira and their fall, she makes parallels between the events in her life and the six realms of rebirth. She also mentions a dream in which she saw the Taira in the dragon king&#x27;s palace asking her to pray for their salvation.

The bell of the Jakkō-in sounds (parallel to the bells of the Gion monastery in the first lines of &quot;the Tale&quot;) and the Retired Emperor leaves for the capital. Misfortunes of the Taira are blamed on Taira no Kiyomori (his evil deeds caused the suffering of the whole Taira clan). In 1191, Tokuko falls ill, dies invoking Amitābha&#x27;s name and is welcomed by Amitābha to Sukhavati.

<text>The Chlamydiota (synonym Chlamydiae) are a bacterial phylum and class whose members are remarkably diverse, including pathogens of humans and animals, symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa, and marine sediment forms not yet well understood. All of the Chlamydiota that humans have known about for many decades are obligate intracellular bacteria; in 2020 many additional Chlamydiota were discovered in ocean-floor environments, and it is not yet known whether they all have hosts. Historically it was believed that all Chlamydiota had a peptidoglycan-free cell wall, but studies in the 2010s demonstrated a detectable presence of peptidoglycan, as well as other important proteins.

Among the Chlamydiota, all of the ones long known to science grow only by infecting eukaryotic host cells. They are as small as or smaller than many viruses. They are ovoid in shape and stain Gram-negative. They are dependent on replication inside the host cells; thus, some species are termed obligate intracellular pathogens and others are symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa. Most intracellular Chlamydiota are located in an inclusion body or vacuole. Outside cells, they survive only as an extracellular infectious form.

These Chlamydiota can grow only where their host cells grow, and develop according to a characteristic biphasic developmental cycle. Therefore, clinically relevant Chlamydiota cannot be propagated in bacterial culture media in the clinical laboratory. They are most successfully isolated while still inside their host cells.

Of various Chlamydiota that cause human disease, the two most important species are &quot;Chlamydia pneumoniae&quot;, which causes a type of pneumonia, and &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;, which causes chlamydia. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States, and 2.86 million chlamydia infections are reported annually.

== History ==

Chlamydia-like disease affecting the eyes of people was first described in ancient Chinese and Egyptian manuscripts. A modern description of chlamydia-like organisms was provided by Halberstaedrrter and von Prowazek in 1907.

Chlamydial isolates cultured in the yolk sacs of embryonating eggs were obtained from a human pneumonitis outbreak in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and by the mid-20th century, isolates had been obtained from dozens of vertebrate species. The term chlamydia (a cloak) appeared in the literature in 1945, although other names continued to be used, including Bedsonia, Miyagawanella, ornithosis-, TRIC-, and PLT-agents. In 1956, Chlamydia trachomatis was first cultured by Tang Fei-fan, though they were not yet recognized as bacteria.

== Nomenclature ==

In 1966, Chlamydiota were recognized as bacteria and the genus Chlamydia was validated. The order Chlamydiales was created by Storz and Page in 1971. The class Chlamydiia was recently validly published. Between 1989 and 1999, new families, genera, and species were recognized. The phylum Chlamydiae was established in Bergey&#x27;s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. By 2006, genetic data for over 350 chlamydial lineages had been reported. Discovery of ocean-floor forms reported in 2020 involves new clades. In 2022 the phylum was renamed Chlamydiota.

==Taxonomy and molecular signatures==

The Chlamydiota currently contain eight validly named genera, and 14 genera. The phylum presently consist of two orders (Chlamydiales, Parachlamydiales) and nine families within a single class (Chlamydiia). Only four of these families are validly named (Chlamydiaceae, Parachlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae, Waddliaceae) while five are described as families (Clavichlamydiaceae, Criblamydiaceae, Parilichlamydiaceae, Piscichlamydiaceae, and Rhabdochlamydiaceae).

The Chlamydiales order as recently described contains the families Chlamydiaceae, and the Clavichlamydiaceae, while the new Parachlamydiales order harbors the remaining seven families. This proposal is supported by the observation of two distinct phylogenetic clades that warrant taxonomic ranks above the family level. Molecular signatures in the form of conserved indels (CSIs) and proteins (CSPs) have been found to be uniquely shared by each separate order, providing a means of distinguishing each clade from the other and supporting the view of shared ancestry of the families within each order. The distinctness of the two orders is also supported by the fact that no CSIs were found among any other combination of families.

Molecular signatures have also been found that are exclusive for the family Chlamydiaceae. The Chlamydiaceae originally consisted of one genus, Chlamydia, but in 1999 was split into two genera, Chlamydophila and Chlamydia. The genera have since 2015 been reunited where species belonging to the genus Chlamydophila have been reclassified as Chlamydia species.

However, CSIs and CSPs have been found specifically for Chlamydophila species, supporting their distinctness from Chlamydia, perhaps warranting additional consideration of two separate groupings within the family. CSIs and CSPs have also been found that are exclusively shared by all Chlamydia that are further indicative of a lineage independent from Chlamydophila, supporting a means to distinguish Chlamydia species from neighbouring Chlamydophila members.

==Phylogenetics==

The Chlamydiota form a unique bacterial evolutionary group that separated from other bacteria about a billion years ago, and can be distinguished by the presence of several CSIs and CSPs. The species from this group can be distinguished from all other bacteria by the presence of conserved indels in a number of proteins and by large numbers of signature proteins that are uniquely present in different Chlamydiae species.

Reports have varied as to whether the Chlamydiota are related to the Planctomycetota or Spirochaetota. Genome sequencing, however, indicates that 11% of the genes in Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25 and 4% in the Chlamydiaceae are most similar to chloroplast, plant, and cyanobacterial genes. Cavalier-Smith has postulated that the Chlamydiota fall into the clade Planctobacteria in the larger clade Gracilicutes. However, phylogeny and shared presence of CSIs in proteins that are lineage-specific indicate that the Verrucomicrobiota are the closest free-living relatives of these parasitic organisms. Comparison of ribosomal RNA genes has provided a phylogeny of known strains within Chlamydiota.

==Human pathogens and diagnostics==

Three species of Chlamydiota that commonly infect humans are described:
* Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes the eye-disease trachoma and the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia
* Chlamydophila pneumoniae, which causes a form of pneumonia
* Chlamydophila psittaci, which causes psittacosis

The unique physiological status of the Chlamydiota including their biphasic lifecycle and obligation to replicate within a eukaryotic host has enabled the use of DNA analysis for chlamydial diagnostics. Horizontal transfer of genes is evident and complicates this area of research. In one extreme example, two genes encoding histone-like H1 proteins of eukaryotic origin have been found in the prokaryotic genome of C. trachomatis, an obligate intracellular pathogen.

<text>Them were a Northern Irish rock band formed in Belfast, in April 1964, most prominently known for their 1964 garage rock standard &quot;Gloria&quot; and launching Van Morrison&#x27;s musical career. The original five-member band consisted of Morrison, Alan Henderson, Ronnie Milling, Billy Harrison, and Eric Wrixon.

Them scored two UK hits in 1965 with &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (UK No. 10) and &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; (UK No. 2; Ireland No. 2). The latter song and &quot;Mystic Eyes&quot; were top 40 hits in the US.

Morrison quit the band in 1966 and went on to a successful career as a solo artist. Although they had relatively few hit singles, the group had considerable influence on other bands, such as the Doors.

The band&#x27;s recording of &quot;Gloria&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. It was ranked No. 69 in Dave Marsh&#x27;s 1989 book, &quot;The Heart of Rock and Soul, The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever&quot; and &quot;Mystic Eyes&quot; was ranked No. 458. &quot;Gloria&quot; was listed at No. 208 in the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s feature The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

== Origins ==
=== Formation ===
In April 1964, Van Morrison responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new R&amp;B club at the Maritime Hotel–an old dance hall frequented by sailors. The new club needed a band for its opening night; however Morrison had left the Golden Eagles (the group with which he had been performing at the time), so he created a new band out of the Gamblers, an East Belfast group formed by Ronnie Milling, Billy Harrison, and Alan Henderson in 1962. Eric Wrixon, still a schoolboy, was the piano player and keyboardist. Morrison played saxophone and harmonica and shared vocals with Billy Harrison. They followed Eric Wrixon&#x27;s suggestion for a new name, and the Gamblers morphed into Them, their name taken from the 50s horror movie &quot;Them!&quot;

The band&#x27;s strong performances at the Maritime attracted attention. Them performed without a routine and Morrison ad libbed, creating his songs live as he performed. While the band did covers, they also played some of Morrison&#x27;s early songs, such as &quot;Could You Would You&quot;, which he had written in Camden Town while touring with the Manhattan Showband. The debut of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot; happened on stage here. Sometimes, depending on his mood, the song could last up to twenty minutes. Morrison has said, &quot;Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel,&quot; believing the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records. The statement also reflected the instability of the Them line-up, with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive Maritime period. Morrison and Henderson remained the only constants, and a less successful version of Them soldiered on after Morrison&#x27;s departure.

Dick Rowe of Decca Records became aware of the band&#x27;s performances, and signed Them to a standard two-year contract. In that period, they released two albums and ten singles, with two more singles released after Morrison departed the band. They had three chart hits, &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (1964), &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; (1965), and &quot;Mystic Eyes&quot; (1965), but it was the B-side of &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, the garage band classic &quot;Gloria&quot;, which went on to become a rock standard covered by Patti Smith, the Doors, the Shadows of Knight, Jimi Hendrix, and many others.

=== Maritime Hotel ===
On 14 April 1964, an advertisement in a Belfast newspaper asked: &quot;Who Are? What Are? THEM&quot;. Similarly curious advertisements followed until the Friday before the gig (17 April 1964) announced that Them would be performing that evening at Club Rado at the Maritime Hotel. Attendance at the two hundred capacity venue quickly grew with a packed house by the third week.

Them performed without a routine, fired by the crowd&#x27;s energy. Morrison later commented that while the band was &quot;out of our element&quot; making records. &quot;The way we did the numbers at the Maritime was more spontaneous, more energetic, more everything, because we were feeding off the crowd.&quot; Morrison ad libbed songs as he performed and &quot;Gloria&quot;, the song he had written at eighteen years old, took shape here and could last up to twenty minutes. According to Morrison, &quot;Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel&quot; but only very rudimentary recordings survive. One fan&#x27;s recording of &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot; made its way to Mervyn and Phil Solomon, who contacted Decca Records&#x27; Dick Rowe, who then travelled to Belfast to hear Them perform. Rowe and Phil Solomon agreed on a two-year contract with the members of the band then signed with Solomon. Morrison being only eighteen, had to have his father sign for him. Within a few weeks, the group was taken to England and into Decca&#x27;s recording studio in West Hampstead for their first recording session.

== Peak years ==
=== With Decca ===

Them&#x27;s first recording session took place in London on 5 July 1964. &quot;Turn on Your Love Light&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot; were recorded during this session as were both sides of their first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Crying Now&quot; and &quot;One Two Brown Eyes&quot; as well as &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Philosophy&quot; and Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Judge a Book by Its Cover&quot;. The session was remarkable in its employment of two drums tracks, which can be clearly heard in the stereo mixes of &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;One Two Brown Eyes&quot;. Rowe used session musicians Arthur Greenslade on organ and Bobby Graham on second drum kit. At this late stage it became clear that the parents of Eric Wrixon, a minor in law, would not sign the contract on his behalf so he was replaced by Pat John McAuley. The single, released in August, did not prove to be successful.

Their next single, Big Joe Williams&#x27;s &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; substituted Andy White on drums, Phil Coulter on second keyboard, and added Jimmy Page on rhythm guitar. The lead guitar track was the work of Billy Harrison. It was released in November with &quot;Gloria&quot; as its B-side. In December 1964, Them made their television debut, joining The Rolling Stones, on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; Their manager, Phil Solomon got the track used as the show&#x27;s signature tune and within two weeks it was at No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart, eventually peaking at No. 10.

In January 1965, Them toured England for a second time, staying at the Royal Hotel, which disc jockey Jimmy Savile used as his London base. Savile helped promote the band in his column for &quot;The People&quot; but Them earned a reputation for bad manners and sarcasm in their interviews. Billy Harrison said the attitude problem may have been caused by anti-Irish sentiments on the continent at the time. But, when they were interviewed by a reporter from the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, the reporter remarked, &quot;They were the most boorish bunch of youngsters I&#x27;d come across in my short career.&quot; Phil Coulter recalled the band&#x27;s interview with a female reporter: &quot;They would just sit and mutter monosyllabic grunts to themselves and give her off-the-wall answers&quot;. (Morrison as a solo artist raised such interviews to a &quot;negative art form&quot;). Their management promoted Them by scheduling appearances on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; where, rather than performing live, they were expected to mime and lip sync. Morrison said of this appearance, &quot;It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that type of thing... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that&quot;. He also revealed how the band had, until that time, considered the programme a complete joke.

Their next release was Them&#x27;s biggest hit in the UK, &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;. The producer was also the writer of the song, Bert Berns, an American, who had also co-written &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;. Backed with &quot;All for Myself&quot; it charted in the UK at No. 2 on 22 April 1965, five weeks after entering the charts, and went to No. 24 in the U.S. in May. Both tracks originate from the same session in October 1964 that yielded &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; but were temporarily shelved by Decca in favour of Lulu&#x27;s version of &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; which reached only No. 50 on the British charts.

On 11 April 1965, Them made a guest appearance at the &quot;NME&quot; Pollwinners Concert at Wembley Empire Pool: Jimmy Savile was MC for this event, which also included The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Animals, The Searchers, The Moody Blues and Dusty Springfield. The bands had been expected to keep to their current hits, but Them audaciously segued from &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; into a seven-minute version of &quot;Turn on Your Love Light&quot;. After the performances, &quot;NME&quot;″s Derek Johnson commented that Morrison had &quot;more genuine soul than any of his British contemporaries&quot;.

The band released their first album, &quot;The Angry Young Them&quot;, in June 1965 (UK) and it appeared in the US on Parrot Records in July. But Them&#x27;s next single, &quot;One More Time&quot;, chosen by Phil Solomon, failed–according to Billy Harrison because it never constituted single material. In July 1965, the band added English drummer Terry Noon and Scottish lead guitarist Joe Baldi but they left in September. Their second album, &quot;Them Again&quot;, was released in January 1966 in the UK and in April 1966 in the US.

=== Success in North America and departure of Morrison ===

The group was marketed in the United States as part of the British Invasion. After the success of &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, the band scored a chart hit again later in 1965 with &quot;Mystic Eyes&quot;, which reached No.33. &quot;Them Again&quot;, released in April 1966 in the US, also charted and the band began a US tour in May 1966. From 30 May to 18 June, Them had a residency at the famous Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. For the final week The Doors opened for Them and on the last night the two bands and Morrisons jammed a twenty-minute version of &quot;Gloria&quot; and a twenty-five-minute version of &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot;. Next Them headlined at The Fillmore in San Francisco and then to Hawaii, where disputes erupted among band members and management over money. The band broke apart, Morrison and Henderson returning to Belfast while Ray Elliott and David Harvey decided to stay in America.

Van Morrison has placed the break-up of Them in context: &quot;There was no motive behind anything you did [back then]. You just did it because you wanted to do it and you enjoyed doing it. That&#x27;s the way the thing started, but it got twisted somewhere along the way and everybody involved in it got twisted as well, including me. You can&#x27;t take something like that, put it in a box and place a neat little name on it, then try to sell it. That&#x27;s what they tried to do. That&#x27;s what killed Them.&quot;

Van Morrison went on to great success and fame as a solo artist, but Them&#x27;s combination of garage rock and blues proved a major influence on the next generations of rock musicians, and the group&#x27;s best-known singles have become staples of rock and roll.

== Post-Morrison ==

=== Belfast Gypsies ===
In late August 1965, Billy Harrison and Pat McAuley formed a rival Them, competing with the Morrison/Henderson line-up and leading to legal action. In March 1966, the latter won the rights to the name while the former, now without Harrison but with Pat&#x27;s brother Jackie McAuley (born John James McAuley, 14 December 1946, in Coleraine, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland; ex-Them, ex-Kult), were only allowed to call themselves &#x27;Other Them&#x27; in the UK. The McAuley brothers unofficially became Them Belfast Gypsies (or Gipsies), though they were never actually billed as such, and recorded two singles on Island Records (one released under the name Freaks of Nature) and one Swedish-only album, all produced by Kim Fowley. They toured Europe billed as Them and released a French EP under that name but broke up in November 1966. Not long after that the Morrison line-up also split. In March 1967 Morrison did a short tour of the Netherlands backed by Cuby &amp; the Blizzards, actually only the Blizzards without lead singer Cuby, and then left for New York to start his solo career. The rest regrouped in Belfast, recruited Kenny McDowell (born Kenneth McDowell, 21 December 1944, in Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland) (ex–Mad Lads) as lead singer and continued touring and recording steadily after relocating to the US in early 1967 at the invitation of producer Ray Ruff.

=== 1968 until dissolution ===
Two albums, &quot;Now and Them&quot; and &quot;Time Out! Time In for Them&quot;, found the band experimenting with psychedelia. Then Jim Armstrong and Kenny McDowell returned to Belfast to perform as Sk&#x27;boo (Armstrong, McDowell and Ray Elliot reunited in Chicago in 1969 as Truth and recorded a number of demos and soundtrack songs later released as &quot;Of Them and Other Tales&quot;).

Henderson hired session musicians for two more records for Ray Ruff&#x27;s Happy Tiger Records, in a hard rock vein with country and folk elements; &quot;Them&quot; (1969) features Jerry Cole as guitarist while &quot;Them in Reality&quot; (1970) features lead guitarist Jim Parker and drummer John Stark (both ex–Kitchen Cinq). Henderson also co-wrote a rock opera, &quot;Truth of Truths&quot;, produced by Ray Ruff in 1971. These efforts were met with consumer indifference and in 1972 Them dissolved. Alan Henderson, Billy Harrison and Eric Wrixon reunited in 1979, without Morrison, recording another album, &quot;Shut Your Mouth&quot;, and undertaking a tour of Germany using Billy Bell on drums, and Mel Austin as vocalist. Since the 1990s, Wrixon had toured under the moniker of Them the Belfast Blues Band, at one point including ex-Them guitarists Jim Armstrong and Billy Harrison.

Alan Henderson died on 9 April 2017 in Big Lake, Minnesota, at the age of 72.

<text>Wanda is a female given name of Polish origin. It probably derives from the tribal name of the Wends. The name has long been popular in Poland where the legend of Princess Wanda has been circulating since at least the 12th century. In 1947, Wanda was cited as the second most popular name, after Mary, for Polish girls, and the most popular from Polish secular history. The name was made familiar in the English-speaking world by the 1883 novel &quot;Wanda&quot;, written by Ouida, the story line of which is based on the last years of the Hechingen branch of the Swabian House of Hohenzollern. In the United States, Wanda attained its highest popularity in the year 1934, peaking then at No. 47 on the list of names most frequently given to female infants. The name is popularly misinterpreted as meaning &quot;wanderer.&quot;

<doc id="584739" wikidata="Q15243259" url="?curid=584739" title="M11 link road protest">
<text>The M11 link road protest was a campaign against the construction of the M11 link road in east London in the early to mid-1990s. &quot;A12 Hackney to M11 link road&quot;, as it was officially called, was part of a significant local road scheme to connect traffic from the East Cross Route (A12) in Hackney Wick to the M11 via Leyton, Leytonstone, Wanstead and the Redbridge Roundabout, avoiding urban streets.

The road had been proposed since the 1960s, as part of the London Ringways, and was an important link between central London and the Docklands to East Anglia. However, road protests elsewhere had become increasingly visible, and urban road building had fallen out of favour with the public. A local Member of Parliament Harry Cohen, representing Leyton, had been a vocal opponent of this scheme.

The protests reached a new level of visibility during 1993 as part of a grassroots campaign where protesters came from outside the area to support local opposition to the road. The initial focus was on the removal of a tree on George Green, east of Wanstead, that attracted the attention of local, then national media. The activity peaked in 1994 with several high-profile protesters setting up micronations on property scheduled for demolition, most notably on Claremont Road in Leyton. The final stage of the protest was a single building on Fillebrook Road in Leytonstone, which, due to a security blunder, became occupied by squatters.

The road was eventually built as planned, and opened to traffic in 1999, but the increased costs involved in management and policing of protesters raised the profile of such campaigns in the United Kingdom, and contributed to several road schemes being cancelled or reviewed later on in the decade. Those involved in the protest moved on to oppose other schemes in the country. By 2014, the road had become the ninth most congested in the entire country.

==Background==
The origin of the link road stems from what were two major arterial roads out of London (the A11 to Newmarket and Norwich, and the A12 to Colchester, Ipswich and Great Yarmouth) and subsequent improvements. The first of these was the Eastern Avenue improvement, that opened on 9 June 1924, which provided a bypass of the old road through Ilford and Romford.

Proposals for the route first arose in the 1960s as part of the London Ringways plan, which would have seen four concentric circular motorways built in the city, together with radial routes, with the M11 motorway ending on Ringway 1, the innermost Ringway, at Hackney Marsh.
A section of Ringway 1 known as the East Cross Route was built to motorway standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s and designated as the A102(M). A section of the M11 connecting Ringway 2 (now part of the North Circular Road) and Eastern Avenue to Harlow was completed in the late 1970s, opening to traffic in 1977.

The Ringways scheme met considerable opposition; there were protests when the Westway, an urban motorway elevated over the streets of Paddington, was opened in 1970, with local MP John Wheeler later describing the road&#x27;s presence within 15 metres of properties as &quot;completely unacceptable environmentally,&quot; and the Archway Road public inquiry was repeatedly abandoned during the 1970s as a result of protests. By 1974, the Greater London Council announced it would not be completing Ringway 1. The first Link Road Action Group to resist the M11 link road was formed in 1976, and for the next fifteen years activists fought government plans through a series of public inquiries. Their alternative was to build a road tunnel, leaving the houses untouched, but this was rejected on grounds of cost. Drivers travelling in the areas where the new roads would have been built had to continue using long stretches of urban single-carriageway roads. In particular, the suburbs of Leyton, Leytonstone and Wanstead suffered serious traffic congestion.

The Roads for Prosperity white paper published in 1989 detailed a major expansion of the road building programme and included plans for the M12 Motorway between London and Chelmsford, as well as many other road schemes. Although the Leyton MP Harry Cohen suggested in May 1989 that the government should scrap the scheme, a public enquiry was held for the scheme in November.

==The protest campaign==
By the 1980s, planning blight had affected the area, and artists and squatters had moved into many of the houses. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of whom he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.

Protesters from the local area against the link road scheme were joined by large numbers of anti-road campaigners from around the UK and beyond, attracted by the availability of free housing along the route. These experienced protesters, who had participated in earlier events such as the Anti-Nazi League riots in Welling, gave impetus to the campaign. The new arrivals used the skills they had developed during prior protests to construct &quot;defences&quot;, blocking the original entrances to the houses and creating new routes directly between them.

Sophisticated techniques were used to delay the construction of the road. Sit-ins and site invasions were combined with sabotage to stop construction work temporarily. This led to large numbers of police and constant security patrols being employed to protect the construction sites, at great expense. By December 1994, the total cost of construction had been estimated at £6 million and rising by £500,000 every month.

The protesters were successful in publicising the campaign, with most UK newspapers and TV news programmes often covering the protests. Desktop publishing, then in its infancy, was used to produce publicity materials for the campaign and send out faxes to the media. When the government began evicting residents along the route and demolishing the empty houses, the protesters set up so-called &quot;autonomous republics&quot; such as &quot;Wanstonia&quot; in some groups of the houses. Extreme methods were used to force the engineers to halt demolition, including tunnels with protesters secured within by concrete.

===The chestnut tree on George Green===
Until late 1993, local opposition to the M11 extension had been relatively limited. While opposition had been going for nearly ten years, institutional avenues of protest had been exhausted, and local residents were largely resigned to the road being built. When outside protesters arrived in September 1993, few residents saw their mission as &quot;their campaign&quot;.

One section of the M11 extension was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it, but because this was a cut and cover tunnel, this required the tree to be cut down.

Support for the protests started to extend to the local community when Jean Gosling, a lollipop lady in Wanstead, upon learning of the tree&#x27;s impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job for doing so while wearing her uniform), who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was then that the non-resident radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.

Protesters continued to delay the destruction of the tree. Solicitors for the campaign had even argued in court that receipt of a letter addressed to the tree itself gave it the status of a legal dwelling, causing a further delay. In the early morning of 7 December 1993, several hundred police arrived to evict the protesters, which took ten hours to carry out. Protesters made numerous complaints against the police; police, in turn, denied these allegations, attributing any misbehaviour to the protesters. Media attention started to increase regarding the protest, with several daily newspapers putting pictures of the tree on their front pages.

Harry Cohen, MP for Leyton, started to become critical of the scheme and its progress. In March 1994, he said &quot;the Department of Transport&#x27;s pig-headed approach to the M11 link road has been a shambles, and a costly one at that,&quot; and described the ongoing police presence as &quot;a miniature equivalent of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.&quot; According to him, local resident Hugh Jones had been threatened by demolition men wielding sledgehammers and pickaxes, adding &quot;the project has cost £500,000 in police time alone, to take over and demolish a 250-year-old chestnut tree and half a dozen houses&quot;.

===Claremont Road===

By 1994, properties scheduled for demolition had been compulsorily purchased, and most were made uninhabitable by removing kitchens, bathrooms and staircases. The notable exception was in one small street, Claremont Road, which ran immediately next to the Central line and consequently required every property on it to be demolished. The street was almost completely occupied by protesters except for one original resident who had not taken up the Department for Transport&#x27;s offer to move, 92-year-old Dolly Watson, who was born in number 32 and had lived there nearly all her life. She became friends with the anti-road protesters, saying &quot;they&#x27;re not dirty hippy squatters, they&#x27;re the grandchildren I never had.&quot; The protesters named a watchtower, built from scaffold poles, after her.

A vibrant and harmonious community sprung up on the road, which even won the begrudging respect of the authorities. The houses were painted with extravagant designs, both internally and externally, and sculptures erected in the road; the road became an artistic spectacle that one said &quot;had to be seen to be believed&quot;.

On 28 November 1994, the eviction of Claremont Road started, bringing an end to the M11 link road resistance as a major physical protest. About 700 bailiffs and police in full riot gear carried out the eviction, and the Central line running adjacent to the road was suspended. The obstacles that had been built and passive resistance, helped by a secret tunnel from another street allowing protesters to re-enter Claremont Road, caused the eviction to take several days. As soon as eviction was completed, the remaining properties were demolished. In the end, the cost to the taxpayer included over a million pounds in police costs alone. Quoting David Maclean, &quot;I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the cost of policing the protest in order to allow bailiffs to take possession of the premises in Claremont road was £1,014,060.&quot; Cohen complained in Parliament about police brutality, asking &quot;Were not many of my constituents bullied—including vulnerable people, and others whose only crime was living on the line of route?&quot; The then Secretary of State for Transport, Brian Mawhinney, pointed out that there had already been three public inquiries at which protesters could have lodged their objections against the line of the route.

===Towards the end===

Following the Claremont Road eviction, non-resident protesters moved on to other sites such as Newbury. Meanwhile, Fillebrook Road near Leytonstone Underground station had already had several houses demolished on it due to problems with vandalism. By 1995, the only house left standing was number 135. The house was originally scheduled for demolition at the same time as the others, but had been left standing in order to give the tenant additional time to relocate. After they had done so, on 11 April 1995, the Department for Transport removed the water supply and part of the roof, and left two security guards on duty. When the guards decided to sleep overnight in their cars that evening, leaving the house unoccupied, the protesters moved in. The house was renamed &quot;Munstonia&quot; (after &quot;The Munsters&quot;, thanks to its spooky appearance). Like &quot;Wanstonia&quot;, they proclaimed themselves a micro-nation and designed their own national anthem and flag, though author Joe Moran mentions their legitimacy was complicated by the protesters continuing to claim unemployment benefits from the &quot;mother country.&quot;
A tower was built out of the remains of the roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and blockades were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from &quot;Munstonia&quot; was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.

Construction of the road, already underway by this stage, was then free to continue largely unhindered, although systematic sabotage of building sites by local people continued. It was completed in 1999 and given the designation A12; its continuation, the former A102(M), was also given this number as far as the Blackwall Tunnel.

The official opening of the road in October 1999 took place without fanfare, being opened by the Highways Agency Chief Executive rather than a politician, with only journalists with passes being admitted to the ceremony.

==Consequences of the protest campaign==
The M11 link road protest was ultimately unsuccessful in its aim to stop the building of the link road. The total cost of compensation for the project was estimated to be around £15 million.

Proposals for the M12 motorway were cancelled in 1994 during the first review of the trunk road programme. The most significant response from the government occurred when Labour came into office following the 1997 general election, with the announcement of the New Deal for Trunk Roads in England. This proposal cancelled many previous road schemes, including the construction of the M65 over the Pennines, increased fuel prices, and ensured that road projects would only be undertaken when genuinely necessary, stating &quot;there will be no presumption in favour of new road building as an answer.&quot;

Some protesters went on to join the direct action campaign Reclaim the Streets. A protester arrested and detained on the grounds of breach of the peace unsuccessfully challenged the UK Government&#x27;s legislation at the European Court of Human Rights.

In 2002, in response to a major new road building programme and expansion of aviation, a delegation of road protest veterans visited the Department for Transport to warn of renewed direct action in response, delivering a D-lock as a symbol of the past protests. One such protestor, Rebecca Lush went on to found Road Block to support road protesters and challenge the government. In 2007, Road Block became a project within the Campaign for Better Transport. The M11 Link road protests inspired the launch of the video activism organisation &quot;Undercurrents&quot;. Training activists to film the protests, they released &quot;You&#x27;ve got to be choking&quot; in 1994, a 40-minute documentary about the M11 link road campaign.

In 2007, the BBC reported that the cost of the M11 link road had doubled due to the intervention of protesters.

Retrieved May 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; , ) is a national park within parts of the Brest Region (Kamyanyets District and Pruzhany District) and Grodno Region (Svislach District) in Belarus adjacent to the Polish border. Since 1992, it has been a preserved part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Białowieża Forest, the last primeval forest fragment of the European woodlands that once stretched across the European Plain.

== Geography ==
The Belavezhskaya Pushcha Biosphere Reserve spans ab area of (2015), subdivided into transition, buffer, and core zones.
The national park occupies (2015). It is located north of Brest. The nature reserves and the national parks cover 2.7% of the Brest Region territory and 2.6% of the Grodno Region.

===Wildlife===
The park is home to a large population of European bison, the continent&#x27;s heaviest land animals. It has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of black and white storks, Eurasian eagle-owls, European honey-buzzards, and lesser spotted and greater spotted eagles.

== History ==
Most of the Białowieża Forest was declared a national park on August 11, 1932 during the Second Polish Republic. After World War II the forest was divided in accordance with the Polish–Soviet border agreement of August 1945 between the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and the Byelorussian SSR of the Soviet Union. Poland reopened the Białowieża National Park in 1947. In 1957, the Belarusian part received a new status – “The State Reserve-Hunting Farm” (), intended for recreation of the top leaders of the Soviet state and their guests from friendly countries.

In 1991, the forest acquired its current status as a state national park. In 2009 the Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park celebrated the 600th anniversary of its reserve status.

==Access==
The park&#x27;s headquarters are in Kamieniuki. All of the hotels and cafes were rebuilt and new ones were added to the park. The Eco Education Center, which houses the Museum of Nature, was built. Approximately 300,000 people visit the park annually.

The border between the two countries runs through the forest with the Białowieża National Park on the Polish side of the border. Since May 2015 there has been a visa-free regime within the forest for hikers and cyclists at the Pierarova-Białowieża border crossing.

<text>Oundle School is a public school (English fee-charging boarding and day school) for pupils 11–18 situated in the market town of Oundle in Northamptonshire, England. The school has been governed by the Worshipful Company of Grocers of the City of London since its foundation by Sir William Laxton in 1556. The school&#x27;s alumni – known as Old Oundelians – include entrepreneurs, scientists, politicians, military figures and sportspeople.

Oundle has eight boys&#x27; houses, five girls&#x27; houses, two day houses, a junior house and a junior day house. Together these accommodate more than 1100 pupils, generally between the ages of 11 and 18. It is the third-largest boarding school in England after Eton and Millfield.

The current Headmistress is Sarah Kerr-Dineen, who in 2015 became the first woman to lead the school.

The school is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference and the Rugby Group.

In the 2023 A-Levels, the school saw 62.9% of its candidates score A*/A.

==History==
Sir William Laxton, who had been eight times Master of the Worshipful Company of Grocers and was Lord Mayor of London in 1544, died in 1556, and in his will decreed the founding of a school for the local boys of Oundle, which was to be maintained by the Worshipful Company of Grocers. There had been a school on the site since at least 1485, at which Laxton himself was educated, and the school he established was known as Laxton Grammar School. 

The size and reputation of Laxton Grammar School rose gradually in the following centuries, and by the mid-nineteenth century many of the school&#x27;s pupils were being sent to Oundle from around the country to receive their education. In 1876, the decision was made by the Grocers&#x27; Company to divide the school into Laxton Grammar School, which was to continue to educate boys from Oundle and its surrounding villages, in accordance with the will of the founder, and Oundle School, which was to be a public school, accepting the sons of gentlemen from further afield as boarders.

The rise of Oundle to prominence can largely be attributed to F. W. Sanderson, who was the school&#x27;s headmaster from 1892 until his death in 1922. When Sanderson joined Oundle, he found a minor country boarding school; by the time of his death, it had become England&#x27;s leading school for an education in the sciences and engineering. The success of Sanderson can be attributed to his educational ethos; he believed in teaching pupils what they wanted to learn, and as a result helped to introduce subjects such as the sciences, engineering, and to modern languages to the English public school curriculum.

A major development came about in 1990, when Oundle admitted girls for the first time. 

In the year 2000, the decision was made by the school&#x27;s governing body to re-unite Oundle School and Laxton School as a single educational establishment under the common name Oundle School, with Laxton House becoming the day house of the school.

==Present day==
Oundle has 835 boarders and 235 day pupils. It is the third largest independent boarding school in England, after Eton in Berkshire and Millfield in Somerset. The various school buildings, some of which date from the 15th century, are scattered around the market town, with the Cloisters acting as the nucleus of the school community.

&quot;The Good Schools Guide&quot; described the school as a &quot;Popular, well oiled, well heeled co-educational boarding school which is riding high&quot;. Pupils obtain strong results at GCSE and A Level. In their 2013 A Levels pupils achieved 89.1% A* to B grades, with over 60% of grades either A* or A. In the year 2016, 28 pupils achieved 10 or more A* results in their GCSE examinations, with 89% of all results awarded being A* or A. Many pupils go on to study at Oxbridge; the overwhelming majority continue to Russell Group universities. In 2019, 48% of pupils scored A*-A for their A-Levels examination, whereas 79% scored A*-A for their GCSEs.

The school promotes the practice of Christian values and maintains links with the Church of England by celebrating the major events of the Christian calendar. All pupils who board are required to attend services in the school chapel three times a week: one midweek lunch time service, Friday hymn practice, and the Sunday service. Pupils of other faiths are free to worship according to their own beliefs but must still attend chapel with the rest of the school.

The school has an extensive programme of voluntary clubs and societies (approaching 50 in number), which range from poetry and debating to croquet and wine tasting. Each academic subject also has its own society which organises evening lectures from guest speakers throughout the year; these can be either directly related to the syllabus or simply to broaden interest in the subject. A new subject, Trivium, gives Third Form pupils timetabled engagement with extension topics for their own sake, using methods of thought drawn from the traditional liberal arts. Quadrivium is also an option for pupils in the Lower Sixth to study, similar to trivium taught in the Third Form. Outside term time pupils are given the opportunity to participate in the countless regular school trips which explore all corners of the globe. These include history trips to major European cities, language exchanges in Europe and Asia, charity work in Africa, AAAS conventions and politics trips in America, natural history expeditions to Antarctica, and many more.

Sport is considered to be an essential part of school life and while there exists a multitude of sports to choose from, the emphasis remains on traditional team sports such as rugby, hockey, cricket, rowing and soccer for boys, and hockey, netball and tennis for girls. Oundle performs particularly strongly in independent school rugby, cricket, and girls&#x27; hockey. A large proportion of the school gathers to support the 1st XV rugby team on the Two Acre during the Michaelmas and Christmas quarters. The school&#x27;s greatest sporting rivalry is with Uppingham School, while other rivalries include Harrow School, Radley College, Stamford School and Rugby School. The school sends regular rugby, cricket and hockey tours to countries all around the world, while the social &#x27;Ramblers&#x27; cricket team is known in the school for its tours of the U.K. and the Caribbean. The Oundle Rovers Cricket Club (made up of Old Oundelians) plays in &quot;The Cricketer&quot; Cup and hosts its own cricket week at the school. The Rovers have won the cup three times and are fourth in the all-time order of merit.

Like sport, music plays a vital role within school life for many pupils, and over 60% of pupils regularly practise a musical instrument while at Oundle. The school offers an extensive range of groups, bands, orchestras and choirs which cater for many musical tastes. Such is the success of music at Oundle that in recent years many pupils have gone on to receive musical or choral scholarships from Oxbridge, while school bands and choirs have gone on to perform concerts across the UK, Europe and Asia. Musical and non-musical pupils are encouraged to get involved in the house shout and part song competitions in the Lent term which are independently judged and contested fiercely. Possibly the greatest success in the practice of music at the school is its rock society, which can count the likes of Bruce Dickinson among its earliest members. &#x27;Roc-Soc&#x27; has been running since the 1970s and promotes the independent formation of popular music bands which have their own dedicated concerts towards the end of every term. The experimental/industrial music pioneers Throbbing Gristle played at the school in March 1980. 

Oundle School has the largest Combined Cadet Force of any school in the country which plays an important role in both the development of pupils as well as in the community, for example in the annual Remembrance Day service held in St Peter&#x27;s Church. The CCF offers pupils the opportunity to practise their leadership skills whether on parade at school, on the termly field weekends, or on the annual camps. The school has a strong tradition of serving the community with many pupils opting to provide assistance in the local area, or Community Action as an alternative to CCF. There are a broad range of Community Action options available in the Oundle area which cater not only for the needs of the local community but also for the extra-curricular interests of the pupils. Many pupils choose to undertake the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme which provides an ideal combination of the skills they acquire during CCF and Community Action. Every summer since 1982 sixth formers and former pupils have run the Oundle School Mencap holiday, a residential holiday for children with a range of learning disabilities and now a highly respected charity in its own right.

The school has ties with the Laxton Junior School, for primary school pupils, some of whom continue their secondary education as pupils at the senior school. A modern building for Laxton Junior was completed in 2003, which allowed the school to double its intake.

In November 2005 the school was found to have taken part in a cartel of price fixing among public schools. However, Mrs. Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT Director General, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

Oundle won the Tatler Public School of the Year Award in 2018.

==Facilities==


Oundle School&#x27;s facilities include the following:
* Teaching Facilities. There are teaching buildings located throughout the town which house classrooms, studios and science and language laboratories. Many lessons take place in the Cloisters which are located in the heart of the town, and other main teaching buildings include the Adamson Centre, the Gascoigne, the Needham, Old Dryden, the Patrick Centre and SciTec.
* Sporting Facilities. The school has numerous sporting facilities which cater for a wide variety of different sports. Among these are four sand-filled astroturf pitches, a six lane synthetic athletics track, a swimming pool and over twenty tennis courts. The Sports Centre houses two fully equipped sports halls, indoor squash and fives facilities, a climbing wall and well equipped gymnasia. All of these have been rebuilt or refurbished in recent years. There are also extensive playing fields and boating facilities on the nearby River Nene, as well as sailing at Rutland Sailing Club.
* Various CCF buildings including two shooting ranges. There are a number of Combined Cadet Force (CCF) buildings including the Armoury (the main administrative building and rifle store), and various other smaller buildings used primarily for rifle and first aid training. Situated approximately two miles from Oundle, outside the hamlet of Elmington on the Ashton estate, is Oundle School&#x27;s full bore outdoor range. At long, the range is one of the few of its size in the country to be owned by a school. Rifles can be fired from firing points at either 100, 200, 300 or . There is another, smaller .22 shooting range situated next to the school armoury which is used for day to day use.
* The Great Hall was constructed in 1908, with the North and South Wings added shortly afterwards. The Great Hall is located prominently in the centre of the town adjacent to the Cloisters and School House; it is used for a variety of functions throughout the year including concerts, receptions, lectures, debates and assemblies. The building also houses the offices of the Headmaster and the school admissions department. 
* The Chapel of Saint Anthony, consecrated in 1923, was built as a memorial to the fallen of the First World War. It contains some of the most important and influential stained glass in the country including the John Piper windows of 1954. The Chapel is where the school community meets. It links past and present, and bears witness, both in itself and in its art and worship, to the abiding values of the Christian Faith. The chapel houses two organs, a classical instrument built in 1984 by Frobenius of Denmark has three manuals and pedals, thirty-five speaking stops and mechanical action. It is situated in the Gallery at the West end. An electronic instrument installed by Copeman Hart in 2000 and situated at the East end of the Chapel provides accompaniment for the Chapel Choir, and leads the whole school singing. It has three manuals and pedals with a West end solo division.
* The Yarrow Gallery is the school&#x27;s private art gallery, donated in 1918 by the shipbuilder Sir Alfred Yarrow in memory of his son, Eric, who was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres. The gallery puts on approximately half a dozen exhibitions every year. The space is adaptable and suitable for activities such as poetry readings, plays and small concerts as well as exhibitions. The purpose of the museum is that it should house a collection of pictures, specimens and models to illustrate &quot;the history, development and beauty of the various branches of knowledge&quot;. The genealogical tree of the aeroplane and the Durham miner were charted and exhibits such as the skeleton of the white horse which used to draw the School ambulance to the Sanatorium were featured. The statue by Kathleen Scott entitled &quot;Here Am I, Send Me&quot; is erroneously held to be modelled on her son Peter Scott.
* The Stahl Theatre opened in 1980 and runs from a converted church on West Street; it can seat an audience of over 400. The Stahl Theatre is owned and managed by Oundle School, run by the Drama Department staff, many of whom have a professional theatre background. It houses both the School productions and visiting professional theatre companies.
* The Patrick Engineering Centre specialises in design technology, automobile engineering and other manual crafts. The school has had a strong reputation for science and engineering since the days of F. W. Sanderson, and this is reflected in the excellent facilities and equipment located within these buildings. Opened in 1998 after a generous donation from an old boy, the Patrick Centre plays an important role in the academic and extra-curricular activities of many pupils. Year after year Oundelians continue to build cars and other forms of automobile, the parts of which are manufactured almost entirely in the workshops.
* The Cripps Library was opened in 1988. It houses approximately 22,000 books encompassing all subjects. The Library is staffed throughout the school day and is open to the whole school for research, information or borrowing for academic work and leisure reading. The library was completely refurbished in 2011, with study spaces named in honour of inspirational former teachers at the school. The Peter Ling Room houses the new display cabinets for the Greek pots, the Dudley Heesom Room has been equipped with computer projection facilities for classes and meetings, the Rare Book Room now houses the rare book collection in sycamore cabinets. 
* School Archive is located in the old stables at Cobthorne House. It conserves an increasingly wide-ranging collection of photographs, newspaper cuttings, publications and record books relating to the school&#x27;s history, the most notable being the earliest register of pupils of 1626.
* OSCAR Radio. The school houses its own radio station which broadcasts from newly converted studios in the Gascoigne Building. Over 2000 pupils and local children have taken part in OSCAR broadcasts since 1998.
* SciTec. The first phase of a new science and technology centre was completed in summer 2007. In September 2007 it was officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester. The project in total cost around £20 million in total. SciTec was the School&#x27;s millennium project which upon completion was intended to create a distinctive, new centre to combine the Sciences, Art and Design and Technology. The first stage houses the Chemistry and Biology departments. In 2016, the sci-tec building was extended to house the maths department on the ground floor and first floor, including laboratories for students to use to conduct their own experiments for an EPQ. The Patrick Engineering Centre for Design, Engineering and Technology opened in the same year, marking the completion of the project.

==Old Oundelians==

<doc id="584748" wikidata="Q712820" url="?curid=584748" title="Howard Jones (British musician)">
<text>John Howard Jones (born 23 February 1955) is a British musician, singer and songwriter. He had ten top 40 hit singles in the UK between 1983 and 1986, six of which reached the top ten, including &quot;Like to Get to Know You Well&quot; , &quot;What Is Love?&quot;, &quot;New Song&quot;, and &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot;. His 1984 album &quot;Human&#x27;s Lib&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. Around the world, Jones had 15 top 40 hit singles between 1983 and 1992. The 1986 hit single &quot;No One Is to Blame&quot; reached No. 4 on the US charts. Four others placed in the US top 20.

Jones is associated with the 1980s Second British Invasion of the US. He has been described by the AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine as &quot;one of the defining figures of mid-&#x27;80s synth-pop&quot;, and he performed at Live Aid in 1985. He has sold over eight million albums.

==Early life==
John Howard Jones was born in Southampton to Welsh parents and spent his early years in Rhiwbina, Cardiff, South Wales, where he attended Heol Llanishen Fach primary school and then Whitchurch Grammar School. Jones is the eldest of four boys. His brothers, Roy, Martin, and Paul, are all musicians in their own right. Jones began taking piano lessons at age seven. He later attended the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. 

The family moved to Canada twice, the first time when Jones was nine, settling in Nepean, a suburb of Ottawa. There, he joined his first band, widely misidentified as Warrior – a progressive/classic rock band that Jones founded in 1971 and played with until 1972, this after having returned permanently to England.

Jones attended the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester in the mid-1970s while playing in various bands. 
He left the college after two-and-a-half years of a three-year course because he did not want to be a classical pianist. He met Buddhist practitioner Bill Bryant, who wrote lyrics for some of Jones&#x27;s songs and was a major influence in this period. The Jones brothers (minus Howard) had a band called Red Beat in the late 1970s.

==Career==
===1980s===

Jones appeared as a solo artist in local venues in High Wycombe before inviting mime artist Jed Hoile to perform improvised choreography as Jones played behind him. In 1983, he hired the Marquee Club in London and invited record labels to come and see him perform. After a BBC Radio 1 session, Jones obtained support slots with China Crisis and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) before signing to Warner, then called WEA, in mid-1983. He has cited influences such as OMD (whose song &quot;Enola Gay&quot; was covered by Jones in early live sets), Keith Emerson and Stevie Wonder.

Jones&#x27; first single, &quot;New Song&quot;, was released in September 1983. It reached the top 30 in the US and the top 5 in the UK. He made his debut performance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 22 September 1983. He had four more hits over the next twelve months and a UK number one album, &quot;Human&#x27;s Lib&quot;, which eventually went double platinum. Bill Bryant was credited with jointly writing the lyrics for six songs on the album. &quot;New Song&quot;, &quot;What Is Love?&quot;, and &quot;Pearl in the Shell&quot; all did well during 1983 and 1984. &quot;Human&#x27;s Lib&quot; was certified gold and platinum in several countries. Jones had developed a loyal teen following. His parents ran his fan club.

In the summer of 1984, Jones released &quot;Like to Get to Know You Well&quot;, which he said was &#x27;dedicated to the original spirit of the Olympic Games.&#x27; Although it was not an official Olympic anthem for the Games in Los Angeles that summer, it was a worldwide hit. It reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve featured the song title in ten different languages while Jones sang the title line in French and German on the extended 12″ version. The song also appeared in the film &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; (1985) and the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot; (2006).

In February 1985, Jones appeared with Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock and Thomas Dolby at the 27th Grammy Awards ceremony; the group performed a medley of material from all four artists.

Jones&#x27; second LP was a remix album. It contained six songs, all but one of which had been previously released, but which appeared in elongated formats, including the multilingual version of &quot;Like to Get to Know You Well&quot;. The album was certified gold in the UK.

In 1985, Jones released his second studio album, &quot;Dream into Action&quot;, which included backup work by the trio Afrodiziak. Afrodiziak included Caron Wheeler and Claudia Fontaine. His brother Martin played bass guitar. He had to have an extra string added to his instrument to play some of the bass lines, which had originally been scored for keyboard. One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;No One Is to Blame&quot;, was later re-recorded, featuring Phil Collins as drummer and producer, and performing backing vocals. (This second version appears on Jones&#x27;s U.S. EP &quot;Action Replay&quot;, and also as a bonus track on the CD version of the following LP &quot;One to One&quot;). &quot;Dream into Action&quot; was Jones&#x27;s most successful album and popular worldwide; it reached number two in the UK and number 10 in the US, and remained on the US chart for almost a year. The singles &quot;Life in One Day&quot;, &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot;, and &quot;Look Mama&quot; appeared on this album. In July 1985, Jones performed at Wembley Stadium as part of the Live Aid concert, singing his 1984 hit &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; and playing piano. He also embarked on a world tour.

The EP &quot;Action Replay&quot; was released in 1986. It included the re-recorded version of &quot;No One Is to Blame&quot;. The song was Jones&#x27;s biggest US hit, reaching number 4 on the chart. By this time, his fortunes were changing in his native UK, and &quot;No One Is to Blame&quot; peaked at number 16. His next single, &quot;All I Want&quot;, peaked at number 35, and would be his last UK top 40 hit. Jones released his third studio album, &quot;One to One&quot;, in October 1986, which peaked at number 10 in the UK and would be his last UK hit album, despite achieving gold sales status. In the US, Jones continued to fill large arenas, and the single &quot;You Know I Love You... Don&#x27;t You?&quot; reached the top twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in 1986.

In June 1988, Jones performed at Amnesty International&#x27;s &quot;Festival of Youth&quot; at the Milton Keynes Bowl. Jones&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;Cross That Line&quot; (1989), performed poorly in the UK, but the 1989 singles &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; (his second US Adult Contemporary number 1 hit after &quot;No One Is to Blame&quot;) and &quot;The Prisoner&quot; charted in the US. Jones continued to play large venues in the US during the late 1980s, and the Cross That Line Tour played major outdoor venues in the US in 1989.

===1990s===
Jones&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;In the Running&quot; failed to chart in the UK, but the single &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; (1992) charted in the US.
With his 10-year tenure on the Warner Music label at an end, a greatest-hits compilation &quot;The Best of Howard Jones&quot; was released in 1993. The album peaked at number 36 in the UK, and by 2005 (12 years after its release) it was certified silver by the BPI for over 60,000 copies sold in the UK.

Jones had success as a songwriter for other artists in the early 1990s. He co-wrote the dance-music hits &quot;Heaven Give Me Words&quot; and &quot;Your Wildlife&quot; with the members of Propaganda. The tracks appeared on the 1990 album &quot;1234&quot;; &quot;Heaven Give Me Words&quot; reached number 22 on the Adult Contemporary chart and &quot;Your Wildlife&quot; reached number 22 on the Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart.

After Jones&#x27; contract with WMG expired, he concentrated on production, songwriting, and running a restaurant. He started his own record label, Dtox, releasing a number of albums through the label, such as &quot;Working in the Backroom&quot;, produced in his own recording studio (&#x27;The Shed&#x27;). The album, which sold over 20,000 copies in the first year of release, was made available only at concerts and through his official website.

Jones toured the US and Europe over the next couple of years. &quot;Live Acoustic America&quot; came out in 1996 and &quot;People&quot; in 1998.

===2000s===
In 2001, Jones played keyboards on the Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band tour.

On 20 September 2003, Jones played a 20th anniversary concert at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, London, commemorating the release of his first single. He was joined by Midge Ure and Nena, as well as his mime artist, Jed Hoile. A recording of this concert was later released on DVD. Jones continued to tour and write new music, collaborating with Robbie Bronnimann to co-write and co-produce music for Sugababes, and Jones&#x27; own 2005 album &quot;Revolution of the Heart&quot;. He toured playing gigs in the United States, Italy, Germany and Sweden and played a number of times at the Edinburgh Festival in 2006. The same year Jones provided a vocal for the song &quot;Into the Dark&quot; by Ferry Corsten for the latter&#x27;s album, &quot;L.E.F.&quot; Jones was also featured on Katrina Carlson&#x27;s cover of &quot;No One Is to Blame&quot;, which entered the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart in 2007.

In October 2006, Jones released &quot;Building Our Own Future&quot; as a podsafe track, as one of several established artists looking to use podcasts as a new means of promoting their music and tours. The song debuted at number 1 on the PMC Top10 on 29 October 2006 and spent four weeks at the top of the chart. Jones&#x27; track &quot;Revolution of the Heart&quot; spent five weeks at number 1 on the PMC Top10 during 2007 and finished the year as the number 2 song in their annual countdown.

Jones embarked on an acoustic tour of Australia in 2007, beginning in Brisbane and concluding on 5 April in Perth. The &quot;Revolution Remixed &amp; Surrounded&quot; album was followed in November by &quot;Live in Birkenhead&quot;. Jones performed another acoustic set, with other 1980s acts at the Retrofest, on 1 September 2007 at Culzean Castle in Ayrshire, Scotland. 

Jones is a member of Sōka Gakkai International, and is musical director of one of its choirs, the Glorious Life Chorus. The chorus performs some of his songs in its repertoire, including &quot;Building Our Own Future&quot; and &quot;Respected&quot;. He returned to Australia again in 2009, this time accompanied by vocalist Laura Clapp and music technologist Robbie Bronnimann. On 26 February 2009, Jones was at the UK premiere of Roland&#x27;s new V-Piano in Bristol, and performed &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;. He continues to tour, and played the &#x27;Big Hair Affair 2009&#x27; on 1 August 2009 at the Ryedale Arena, Pickering, North Yorkshire.

&quot;Ordinary Heroes&quot; was released in November 2009, and he toured London, Cardiff and Manchester with a string section and the Morriston Orpheus Choir (in St David&#x27;s Hall in Cardiff). During an interview with the &quot;Stuck in the &#x27;80s&quot; podcast after the album&#x27;s release, Jones said &quot;Soon You&#x27;ll Go&quot; was inspired by his daughter&#x27;s upcoming departure to university, but that the song has come to take on broader meaning about cherishing the time he has with people.

Jones is a member of the board of directors for the Featured Artists Coalition, which was founded in 2009.

===2010s===
On 29 November 2011, a UK tour was announced. &quot;Human&#x27;s Lib&quot; and &quot;Dream Into Action&quot; were performed in April 2012 across eight venues. A weekly radio series coincided with tour called &quot;Electronic 80s with Howard Jones&quot; on Absolute Radio.

In 2012, he appeared on &quot;The Song That Changed My Life&quot; on BYUtv, the cable station for Brigham Young University.

In 2015, the release of &quot;Engage&quot; was made on Jones&#x27; own D-TOX Records.

In 2016, he went out on tour supporting Barenaked Ladies as an opening act for their Last Summer on Earth US tour, reuniting with Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

In 2018, Jones joined fellow musician Steve Hogarth of Marillion by being present at the unveiling of a sculpture in tribute to David Bowie in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

&quot;Transform&quot; was released on 10 May, 2019. It features three collaborations with electronic musician BT. It is the second electronic album in a set of four, the first being &quot;Engage&quot;. In 2022 the third album was released, &quot;Dialogue&quot; consisting of eight songs.

==In the media==
Jones has spoken of the media&#x27;s negative perception of him. In 2006, he said: &quot;My songs are not about drug-taking or debauchery or rock and roll. They&#x27;re about positive thinking and challenging people&#x27;s ideas. I wasn&#x27;t fashionable. I never got good reviews. But I&#x27;m proud of the fact that I wasn&#x27;t liked by the media... Pop music is so reactionary and bigoted. And I found that what&#x27;s &#x27;cool&#x27; is often very shallow and transient.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jones is married to Jan Smith. They have three children: Osheen, Mica and Jasper. In the late 1980s, Jones began practising Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the worldwide Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International; he has credited his daily practice of chanting &quot;Nam myoho renge kyo&quot; (I devote myself to the Lotus Sutra) since 1991 as &quot;having a profoundly positive effect on my life.&quot;

As of 2006, Jones resided in Creech St Michael, near Taunton, Somerset. Jones was a vegetarian for 42 years and became a vegan in 2019.

<text>Void decks refer to the open areas on the ground level of Housing and Development Board (HDB) public housing buildings in Singapore, which are commonly known as HDB blocks. They are one of the most used public spaces in housing estates. The first void deck was implemented in 1963 at Block 26 Jalan Klinik. The void deck is used for a range of casual community activities such as playing board games, exercising, and socialising. It is often booked for Malay weddings, Chinese funerals, and birthday parties. Void decks today are occasionally populated with convenience stores, early education centres, community clubs, senior citizen clubs, and coffee shops.

In contemporary Singapore, Malay wedding receptions are typically conducted at the void deck as it serves as an equivalent to the courtyards of the family&#x27;s house at which Malay wedding receptions are traditionally held. These receptions take place throughout the day and typically invite over 1,000 guests, who are not required to stay for the entire duration, in line with Malay customs. However, there is a misconception that Malay void deck weddings are inexpensive. In reality, these weddings are often heavily decorated and accompanied by a feast, with each reception costing the average couple around S$40,000 to S$50,000.

Chinese funerals are also common at the void deck for Buddhist and Taoist traditions. Christian and Hindu funerals are also held in void decks. They often take place over few days and family members and relatives take turns looking over the venue overnight, typically playing games such as mahjong to keep themselves awake. It is a misconception that void deck funerals are merely convenient and superstitious. Writer and photographer Tan Dingwei stated that &quot;The heritage surrounding death practices in Taoist belief systems are abundant and sophisticated.&quot; Tan published a photo-essay &quot;A Chinese Funeral in a Void Deck&quot; in the book &quot;Death and the Afterlife&quot; edited by Kit Ying Lye and Terence Heng which shows that Chinese funerals vary across beliefs in Singapore.

== Etymology ==
The earliest record of the term &quot;void deck&quot; dates back to a 1967 &quot;Straits Times&quot; newspaper article, where it was used to describe the in-between floors of mixed-use buildings that separated the shopping levels from the residential blocks above them. In 1973, HDB referred to the open ground level as a &#x27;void area&#x27; in the government panel in the newspaper. However, HDB did not utilise the term &quot;void deck&quot; in their annual reports until 1977–1978. Dr. Yaacob Ibrahim Former Minister for Ministry of Communications and Information stated that the term &quot;void deck&quot; is a uniquely Singaporean one.

== Design ==

=== Architecture ===
Despite the name, void decks are not completely empty. The void deck is a largely open space with structural columns that support the residential blocks above it. Smooth white walls coat the verticals, and matte grey covers the base, with some walkways textured to prevent slippage. Although there is some variation, the center of the void deck houses its iconic elevators lobbies and dedicated letterbox area. Residents can collect mail before or after using the elevator. 

The lift lobby at void decks can be treated as the main entrance or &quot;lobby lounges&quot; to HDB blocks. In newer void decks, they are even marked with a different wall and floor design and kept open for the community to furnish and decorate. The void deck&#x27;s large open spaces allow for a variety of temporary functions, acting as &quot;a space that can serve community needs.&quot; The void deck&#x27;s abundance of uses allows residents to establish a niche experience with other residents. However, scholars such as the late Ooi Giok Ling and Thomas Tan have stated that the void deck can become a place for frequent yet superficial social interactions, especially when limited to passing greetings. 

In their book chapter The Social Significance of Public Spaces in Public Housing Estates, Ooi and Tan noted that the space is a &quot;radical embrace of functional indeterminacy,&quot; meaning that the void deck is intentionally designed to have no fixed or predetermined purpose. Hence, Ooi and Tan described the institution of void decks as a &#x27;gamble&#x27; because of this uncertainty of its usage. In the book chapter &quot;Void Deck&quot; in &quot;Public Space in Urban Asia&quot; by William S. W. Lim, Cairns, et. al. dedicated one section called &quot;The Void Deck Gamble&quot;, stating that the void deck was meant to be an open space with no particular function, but the hope was for it to promote &quot;community and identity formation&quot; as mentioned explicitly in government documents.

=== Origins ===
There are various theories behind the implementation of the void deck. According to the biography of late SNOC president and law minister E.W. Barker, edited by Susan Sim, the initial idea of the void deck originated from a 1973 conversation Barker had with former Secretary General S.S. Dhillon while driving at Kim Keat Road towards Toa Payoh. Barker commented on children being drenched in the rain, suggesting, &quot;If only we could raise buildings one level up.&quot; Susan Sim and Dhillon suggested that this was how &quot;the idea of a void deck at the foot of each HDB block came about.&quot; In 2024, TODAY online posted an article which claimed that HDB &quot;initially built void decks for ventilation and flood prevention in dense urban areas&quot;, citing urban planners.

However, Scholars like Louisa-May Khoo and Stephen Cairns echoed the official view that the void deck exists to mix people up, to promote social interaction between people in Singapore&#x27;s ethnically diverse, multicultural, and multi-religious society. In 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) was introduced, which kept the percentage of each racial group in HDB blocks in line the national CMIO racial composition. It is suggested that the presence of void decks below HDB blocks would promote social interaction and contribute to fostering racial harmony.

The NHB&#x27;s e-book titled &quot;Void Deck&quot; from their &quot;Community Heritage Series III&quot; (2013) stated that the intention of the void deck was to provide &quot;a sense of relief&quot; in a highly urbanised environment and create opportunities for community bonding. It also suggested that &quot;[the] introduction of void decks has undeniably improved the lives of HDB flat dwellers as they provide shelter from the rain and sun, promote good airflow and natural light, and allow passers-by easy passage through the estates,&quot; mentioning the other possible reasons stated by Sim, Khoo, Cairns, and Tan.

== History ==
=== The 1960s ===
When HDB blocks were first constructed in the 1960s, they did not include void decks. It was only in the 1970s that HDB began building its flats starting from the second level, creating open space on the ground level. However, exceptions to some new HDB blocks were made to allow for greater convenience for the elderly. 

At the start, void decks featured only basic amenities such as bicycle racks, letterboxes, elevators, and telephone booths. In around every four blocks, early void decks had kiosks that sold household necessities and groceries near the lift lobby. After the creation of the precinct, the kiosks were replaced by precinct facilities such as nearby convenience stores.

=== 1970s to 1980s ===
From the 1970s to 1980s, Singapore began moving kampong residents into HDB estates, otherwise known as New Towns. During this process, New Town HDB void decks served as the functional equivalent of communal kampong spaces for gathering.

In the 1980s, HDB began incorporating entertainment facilities like chess and checker tables, vending machines, and advertisement corners, along with safety and security features such as CCTV surveillance and defibrillators. In 1980, HDB announced that every new HDB block and older estates will have electrical and water facilities for usage at the void deck. Until the 1990s, void decks followed similar rectangular designs, which only changed when HDB began encouraging teams of private firms to &#x27;design-and-build&#x27; HDB flats in 1991.

Since 1982, HDB blocks have been built in a way that links void decks and playgrounds into territories known as precincts. A precinct constitutes up to 750 flats and joins together roughly 4 hectares of flats, creating a common space with which residents can identify. In a precinct, a playground becomes the focal point around which void deck facilities have been built and concentrated. Residents are also within walking distance to conveniences such as small shops, eateries, and grocery stores. Precinct pavilions have been added to newer void decks.

=== 1990s to 2000s ===

In the 1990s, seeing that certain void deck spaces were regularly populated by senior citizens, &quot;Senior Citizens&#x27; Corners&quot; were created. When the first void deck community garden was established in Tampines in 1999, there was an increasing demand from seniors to convert more open spaces into gardening areas. In 2005, National Parks Board created the &quot;Community in Bloom&quot; programme which provided a platform for seniors to initiate their own community gardens. In 2006, The Committee on Ageing Issues (CAI) called for more void decks to be utilised for senior activities.

In newer HDB blocks such as SkyVille@Dawson and Pinnacle@Duxton, void decks are not located on the ground floor but rather integrated with sky gardens. Newer void decks are also smaller in size. Residents have also been allowed a greater say in how the void deck is decorated. Artists may decorate the void deck, but they must first apply for permission from the relevant authorities before displaying their works, as the space belongs to the Town Council of the area where the void deck is located.

=== 2000s to 2010s ===
By the 2010s, the void deck had become normalised as a point of departure and rendezvous for people going for work, school, or the market on the weekdays. People heading to and returning from work or school normally cut across void decks heading the MRT or bus station with very little social interaction with other residents. However, the void deck is still an important meeting point for the senior citizens who spend their days doing light housework and socialising with other seniors.

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022, void decks facilities were cordoned off and restricted from public use. Void deck facilities were an everyday leisure spot for many Singaporeans. The Covid-19 restrictions saw frequent and public cases of residents flouting rules which were recorded and shared through social media along with misinformation. 

== Void deck issues ==
Depending on its users, the void deck can either be a space for wholesome community bonding or a site for inconsiderate behaviour. For some residents, the void deck has developed a negative association due to occasional instances of loitering, playing of loud music, gambling, drinking, drug-taking, etc. In his chapter on the Void Deck, Cairns quoted the concerns of Tan Szue Hann, then Principal Designer of Architecture at Jurong International, stating that:&quot;“School students have always been advised to stay away from void decks, as it’s where smokers hang out, or card-playing happens. Smoking and card-playing is then associated with loitering/antisocial behaviour/gang-related activity, for some reason. And as such, students are indoctrinated to avoid these spaces, and will tend to do so &#x27;til even later on in life.&quot;&quot;It is common for noise complaints to arise regarding the use of the void decks. When there are complaints regarding void deck use, the government often urges communication between residents. Meanwhile, the Singapore-based website Stomp encourages users to publicise and report cases of residents who misuse the void deck. 

On 3 November, 2023, an area of the Block 638 Woodlands Ring Road void deck was taped off by the town council due to noise complaints regarding children playing ball games at the void deck. On 23 November 2023, a netizen contacted TMSG and commented that the decision was &#x27;ridiculous.&#x27;

== In popular culture ==

In a 1995 Singapore Literature Prize Competition, a Commendation Prize was awarded for a collection of poems called &quot;Void Decks and Other Empty Places&quot; by &quot;Colin Cheong.&quot; The first section consisted 20 poems about life in Singapore revolving the void deck. The first one goes as follows:&quot;Long after the birdsong ends&quot;

&quot;spirits gather that never left&quot;

&quot;drawn by the memory of a well-loved face&quot;

&quot;drawn by the life of an empty place&quot;An exhibition titled &quot;Void &amp; Void Decks&quot; by Singaporean artists Chow Chee Yong and Tang Ling Nah was held at the Private Museum from August to September 2012. The interior design of the exhibition room was modelled after a void deck, featuring iconic smooth grey concrete floors, white walls, and rectangular pillars, creating the impression of being at home whilst inside the art gallery. The artist statement on the website is as follows:
Chow juxtaposes different locations with a single shot, creating an ambiguous “Void” that exists only within the photograph. On the other hand, Tang suggests the extension of space through her charcoal drawings of the city’s transitory spaces such as “Void Decks”, corridors and underground passageways.On August 22, 2023, an HDB estate-themed cafe called Lou Shang by Mama Diam opened on Prinsep Street. The cafe&#x27;s entrance and interior mimics the void deck staircase landings and common area. It also serves Singapore-inspired dishes and is furnished with blue-tiled, rounded tables and benches reminiscent of a void deck.

<text>Blended learning or hybrid learning, also known as technology-mediated instruction, web-enhanced instruction, or mixed-mode instruction, is an approach to education that combines online educational materials and opportunities for interaction online with physical place-based classroom methods.

Blended learning requires the physical presence of both teacher and student, with some elements of student control over time, place, path, or pace. While students still attend brick-and-mortar schools with a teacher present, face-to-face classroom practices are combined with computer-mediated activities regarding content and delivery. It is also used in professional development and training settings. Since blended learning is highly context-dependent, a universal conception of it is difficult. Some reports have claimed that a lack of consensus on a hard definition of blended learning has led to difficulties in research on its effectiveness. A well-cited 2013 study broadly defined blended learning as a mixture of online and in-person delivery where the online portion effectively replaces some of the face-to-face contact time rather than supplementing it.

Additionally, a 2015 meta-analysis that historically looked back at a comprehensive review of evidence-based research studies around blended learning, found commonalities in defining that blended learning was &quot;considered a combination of physical f2f [face to face] modes of instruction with online modes of learning, drawing on technology-mediated instruction, where all participants in the learning process are separated by distance some of the time.&quot; This report also found that all of these evidence-based studies concluded that student achievement was higher in blended learning experiences when compared to either fully online or fully face-to-face learning experiences. Whereas, &quot;Hybrid learning is an educational model where some students attend class in-person, while others join the class virtually from home.&quot; Many Universities turned to remote learning and hybrid formats returning from the pandemic.

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;blended learning&quot;, &quot;hybrid learning&quot;, &quot;technology-mediated instruction&quot;, &quot;web-enhanced instruction&quot;, and &quot;mixed-mode instruction&quot; are often used interchangeably in research literature.

Although the concepts behind blended learning first developed in the 1960s, the formal terminology to describe it did not take its current form until the late 1990s. One of the earliest uses of the term appears in a 1999 press release, in which the Interactive Learning Centers, an Atlanta-based education business, announced a change of name to EPIC Learning. The release mentions that &quot;The Company currently operates 220 on-line courses, but will begin offering its Internet courseware using the company&#x27;s Blended Learning methodology.&quot;

The term &quot;blended learning&quot; was initially vague, encompassing a wide variety of technologies and pedagogical methods in varying combinations (some making no use of technology whatsoever). In 2006, the term became more concrete with the publication of the first &quot;Handbook of Blended Learning&quot; by Bonk and Graham. Graham challenged the breadth and ambiguity of the term&#x27;s definition, and defined &quot;blended learning systems&quot; as learning systems that &quot;combine face-to-face instruction with computer mediated instruction&quot;.

In a report titled &quot;Defining Blended Learning&quot;, researcher Norm Friesen suggests that, in its current form, blended learning &quot;designates the range of possibilities presented by combining Internet and digital media with established classroom forms that require the physical co-presence of teacher and students&quot;.

==Delivery and usage==
A research study published in 2023 concluded that: &quot;The overarching message from this study is that the keys to a seamless delivery of hybrid classes and engaged and happy students and teachers are better support, effective training and reliable technology.&quot;

==History==
While the first distance learning programs were introduced in the 1840s, technology-facilitated learning did not exist before the 1970s. Technology-based training emerged as an alternative to instructor-led training in the 1960s on mainframes and mini-computers. The major advantage that blended learning offers is scale, whereas one instructor can only teach so many people. One example is PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations), a system developed by the University of Illinois and Control Data. PLATO in particular had a long history of innovations and offered coursework from elementary to the college level. Mainframe-based training had a number of interface limitations that gave way to satellite-based live video in the 1970s. The advantage here was serving people who were not as computer literate. The major challenge was the expense required to make this work.

Satellite-based live video and CD-ROM based education delivery systems became popular as a way to solve issues with scale. Becoming a popular method in the late 1980s and early 1990s, CD-ROMs emerged as a dominant form of providing technology-based learning as bandwidth through 56k modems wasn&#x27;t able to support very high quality sound and video. The limitation to CD-ROMs was tracking completion of coursework, so learning management systems emerged as a way to facilitate progress tracking. The aviation industry used this heavily to track how well one did on courses, how much time was spent, and where someone left off. AICC, Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee, was formed in 1988 and companies such as Boeing used CD-ROMs to provide training for personnel.

Modern blended learning is delivered online, although CD-ROMs could feasibly still be used if a learning management system meets an institution&#x27;s standards. Some examples of channels through which online blending learning can be delivered include webcasting (synchronous and asynchronous) and online video (live and recorded).

Solutions such as Khan Academy have been used in classrooms to serve as platforms for blended learning.

==Models==
There is little consensus on the definition of blended learning. Some academic studies have suggested it is a redundant term. However, there are distinct blended learning models suggested by some researchers and educational think-tanks. These models include:

*Face-to-face driver – where the teacher drives the instruction and augments with digital tools.
*Rotation – students cycle through a schedule of independent online study and face-to-face classroom time.
*Flex – Most of the curriculum is delivered via a digital platform and teachers are available for face-to-face consultation and support.
*Labs – All of the curriculum is delivered via a digital platform but in a consistent physical location. Students usually take physical classes in this model as well.
*Self-blend – Students choose to augment their physical learning with online course work.
*Online driver – Students complete an entire course through an online platform with possible teacher check-ins. All curriculum and teaching is delivered via a digital platform and face-to-face meetings are scheduled or made available if necessary.

It is important to note that even blended learning models can be blended together and many implementations use some, many, or even all of these as dimensions of larger blended learning strategy. These models, for the most part, are not mutually exclusive.

There are many components that can comprise a blended learning model, including &quot;instructor-delivered content, e-learning, webinars, conference calls, live or online sessions with instructors, and other media and events, for example, Facebook, e-mail, chat rooms, blogs, podcasting, Twitter, YouTube, Skype and web boards&quot;.

==Advantages==
Blended instruction is reportedly more effective than purely face-to-face or purely online classes. Blended learning methods can also result in high levels of student achievement more effective than face-to-face learning.

By using a combination of digital instruction and one-on-one face time, students can work on their own with new concepts which frees teachers up to circulate and support individual students who may need individualized attention. &quot;Rather than playing to the lowest common denominator – as they would in a physical classroom – teachers can now streamline their instruction to help all students reach their full potential.&quot;

Proponents of blended learning argue that incorporating the &quot;asynchronous Internet communication technology&quot; into higher education courses serves to &quot;facilitate a simultaneous independent and collaborative learning experience&quot;.

This incorporation is a major contributor to student satisfaction and success in such courses. The use of information and communication technologies have been found to improve student attitudes towards learning.

By incorporating information technology into class projects, communication between lecturers and part-time students has improved, and students were able to better evaluate their understanding of course material via the use of &quot;computer-based qualitative and quantitative assessment modules&quot;.

Blended learning also has the potential to reduce educational expenses, although some dispute that blended learning is inherently less expensive than physical classroom learning.

Blended learning can lower costs by putting classrooms in the online space and it essentially replaces pricey textbooks with electronic devices that students often bring themselves to class. E-textbooks, which can be accessed digitally, may also help to drive down textbook budgets. Proponents of blended learning cite the opportunity for data collection and customization of instruction and assessment as two major benefits of this approach.

Blended learning often includes software that automatically collects student data and measures academic progress, providing teachers, students and parents detailed students data. Often, tests are automatically scored, providing instantaneous feedback. Student logins and work times are also measured to ensure accountability. Schools with blended learning programs may also choose to reallocate resources to boost student achievement outcomes.

Students with special talents or interests outside of the available curricula use educational technology to advance their skills or exceed grade restrictions. Blended learning allows for personalized education, replacing the model where a teacher stands in front of the classroom and everyone is expected to stay at the same pace. &quot;Blended learning allows students to work at their own pace, making sure they fully understand new concepts before moving on.&quot;

A classroom environment that incorporates blended learning naturally requires learners to demonstrate more autonomy, self-regulation, and independence in order to succeed. If teachers offer a form of initial program orientation before introducing blended learning strategies, it can better prepare students to feel confident navigating the different components and developing a stronger sense of independence.

Blended learning plays an important role to prime students’ learning and to then maximize in-person opportunities and resources.

Some online institutions connect students with instructors via web conference technology to form a digital classroom. These institutions borrow many of the technologies that have popularized online courses at the university level. Some advantages of blended learning, particularly at a Kindergarten to grade 12 level of education, can be found under the general concept of educational technology. It is also one of the most effective ways for personalized learning at scale.

Blended learning supports the use of standards as a way to manage quality and ease of use. This includes multiple kinds of standards: interoperability standards like the SIF specification from A4L or the Learning Tools Interoperability specification from IMS Global Consortium or academic standards like state standards and Common Core State Standards, which encourage integration of technology into a variety of subjects.

A learning management system, or federation of systems, helps develop a better feel for an online community where discussions can be held to better aid students.

This virtual learning environment helps connect professors with students without physically being present, thus making this a &#x27;virtual cafe&#x27;. Many schools use this online tool for online classes, classwork, question &amp; answer forums, and other school related work. Blended learning yielded positive results from the online community. Such results were compared and showed similar results from that of Alcoholics Anonymous and Weight Watchers.

The advantages of blended learning are dependent on the quality of the programs being implemented. Some indicators of excellent blended learning programs are &quot;facilitating student learning, communicating ideas effectively, demonstrating an interest in learning, organizing effectively, showing respect for students, and assessing progress fairly&quot;.

==Disadvantages==
Unless successfully planned and executed, blended learning could have disadvantages in technical aspects since it has a strong dependence on the technical resources or tools with which the blended learning experience is delivered. These tools need to be reliable, easy to use, and up to date, for them to have a meaningful impact on the learning experience.

There are several disadvantages to blended learning. While this type of learning does offer students the ability to go online when necessary, or learn from anywhere, there is no guarantee that each student will have access to the tools that they need to learn on the computer. Another problem that may arise is unreliable internet. Many times, the internet may be down. If the whole class does not have access to the same tools, then the teacher will not be able to keep the class on the same page. This creates a learning gap within classrooms. Unless the education system can offer reliable internet and computers to all students, it is not possible to ensure that this is an effective alternative to mainstream education.

IT literacy can serve as a significant barrier for students attempting to get access to the course materials, making the availability of high-quality technical support paramount. Other aspects of blended learning that can be challenging is group work because of difficulties with management in an online setting.

Reportedly the use of lecture recording technologies can result in students falling behind on the materials. In a study performed across four different universities, it was found that only half of the students watched the lecture videos on a regular basis, and nearly 40% of students watched several weeks&#x27; worth of videos in one sitting. This has further implications for the educator and in how much online resources need to be revealed to the student but also ensure it is at the right level for the intended student.

From an educator&#x27;s perspective, most recently, it has been noted that providing effective feedback is more time-consuming (and therefore more expensive) when electronic media are used, in comparison to traditional (e.g. paper-based) assessments. Using e-learning platforms can be more time-consuming than traditional methods and can also come with new costs as e-learning platforms and service providers may charge user fees to educators.

Another critical issue is access to network infrastructure. Although the digital divide is narrowing as the Internet becomes more pervasive, many students do not have pervasive and ubiquitous access to the Internet – even in their classrooms. Any attempt to incorporate blended learning strategies into an organization&#x27;s pedagogical strategy needs to account for this. This is why learning centers are built with good wi-fi connections to make sure this issue is addressed.

Finally, in educational fields where interprofessional simulation and clinical based placement are key components (i.e. medicine, obstetrics &amp; gynaecology), in-person teaching remains a cornerstone of clinical skills education, and teaching via online discourse alone is not sufficient to completely replace and provide comparable learning outcomes.

==21st century literacies==

The term &quot;21st century literacies&quot; was coined by The National Council of Teachers of English to describe the social nature of learning that is supported by the ability to collaborate using digital technologies in learning. These &#x27;new literacies&#x27; are described as &quot;skills students will need for the society in which they will work&quot;, including &quot;strong communication and collaboration skills, expertise in technology, innovative and creative thinking skills, and an ability to solve problems&quot;. This set of skills and understandings will &quot;prepare the workforce or citizenry for a changing, interconnected world&quot;.

These literacies are dynamic due to the ability to be linked to one another. According to NCTE, active, successful participants in this 21st century global society must be able to:
* develop proficiency and fluency with the tools of technology;
* build intentional cross-cultural connections and relationships with others so to pose and solve problems collaboratively and strengthen independent thought;
* design and share information for global communities to meet a variety of purposes;
* manage, analyze and synthesize multiple streams of simultaneous information;
* create, critique, analyze and evaluate multimedia texts;
* attend to the ethical responsibilities required by these complex environments.

<text>The Nakajima Ki-116 was a late-World War II aircraft developed for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. It was essentially a Ki-84 &quot;Hayate&quot; with the Nakajima Ha-45 engine replaced with a Mitsubishi Ha-112. The design was handled by Mansyū Aircraft in Manchukuo, and thus it is often designated Mansyū Ki-116.

==Design and development==
The Ki-116 was the last variant of the Nakajima Ki-84 &quot;Hayate&quot; to enter flight trials. It was originally the fourth Mansyu-built Ki-84-I, adapted to take a Mitsubishi Ha-112-II (aka Kinsei 62) engine, the same engine used in the Kawasaki Ki-100, driving a three-blade propeller borrowed from a Mitsubishi Ki-46-III &quot;Dinah&quot;. This conversion proved to be very successful, a reduction of in empty weight being registered. The aircraft was still undergoing tests at the time of Japan&#x27;s defeat. It appeared somewhat longer and had an increased tail surface area compared to the original Ki-84.

This aircraft was created as a fighter-interceptor. There is no indication that it was intended for the Special Attack suicide role (&quot;shimbu-tai&quot;).

One aircraft was built at Manshūkoku Hikōki Seizo KK at their plant in Harbin in 1945.

<doc id="584760" wikidata="Q7739826" url="?curid=584760" title="The History of the Standard Oil Company">
<text>The History of the Standard Oil Company is a 1904 book by journalist Ida Tarbell. It is an exposé about the Standard Oil Company, run at the time by oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, the richest figure in American history. Originally serialized in nineteen parts in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; magazine, the book is a seminal example of muckraking, and inspired many other journalists to write about trusts, large businesses that (in the absence of strong antitrust laws in the 19th century) attempted to gain monopolies in various industries.

&quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company&quot; is credited with hastening the breakup of Standard Oil, which came about in 1911, when the Supreme Court of the United States found the company to be violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The subsequent decision splintered the company into 34 &quot;baby Standards.&quot; The value of Rockefeller&#x27;s shares rose after the breakup as the new companies had a positive development on the stock exchange.

The original book was a two-volume hardcover set. An abridged paperback edition was released later.

== Context ==
The inspiration behind &quot;The History of Standard Oil Company&quot; was largely fueled by Ida Tarbell&#x27;s childhood experiences. Her father, Franklin Tarbell, worked for Standard Oil and lived through what Ida called &quot;hate, suspicion, and fear that engulfed the community.&quot; As a direct witness to the schemes and horizontal integration of John D. Rockefeller and his associates, Tarbell began building the foundations of &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company&quot; early with growing senses of interest and discontent.

After her education and to accumulate writing experience, Tarbell began working at &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; Magazine, where she wrote several successful series on historical figures. After this initial success, her shift turned to John D. Rockefeller. She began by interviewing Henry H. Rogers, one of her father&#x27;s fellow independents who became one of Rockefeller&#x27;s colleagues, as well as others close to the inner workings of Standard Oil, that included one of the founders, Frank Barstow, as well. Eventually, Tarbell uncovered a crucial piece of evidence proving that Standard Oil was rigging railroad prices and preying on its competition.

== Reactions and legacy ==
Public outcry erupted at the conclusion of Tarbell&#x27;s 19-part exposure of Standard Oil published in &quot;McClure&#x27;s,&quot; eventually resulting in the expedited breakup of Standard Oil in 1911. Journalists, politicians, and citizens alike celebrated the accomplishments of Tarbell – a woman &quot;outside&quot; the inner workings of business and without significant money or influence. These reactions are immortalized in political cartoons utilizing imagery of Rockefeller&#x27;s hidden agendas being demolished by investigative journalism and muckraking.

Several journal and newspaper reviewers addressed &quot;The History of Standard Oil Company&quot; by praising its calmness in the face of hatred, focus on facts, and genuine exposure of the effects that greed can have on businessmen seeking success. A 1904 editorial review from &quot;The New York Times&quot; relayed the highlights of the volumes to the public, noting the diplomatic tendencies of Tarbell within her work – still widely respectful of the achievements of John D. Rockefeller but critical of Standard Oil&#x27;s business strategies that were unfair and of questionable legality. One review from the &quot;Economic Journal&quot; fixated on the monumental nature of Tarbell&#x27;s work, stating that &quot;it is difficult to write about Miss Tarbell&#x27;s remarkable achievement without using language approaching the edge of hyperbole. So careful is she in her facts, so sane in her judgements, that she seems to have reached the high-water mark of industrial history.&quot;

Though Standard Oil Company accrued more cumulative value after it was broken up, the exposure of what Tarbell described as immoral and illegal business became a striking symbol of the power of the press. As such, &quot;The History of Standard Oil Company&quot; harbors great significance as a standard-bearer of modern investigative journalism.

In 1999 a jury under the aegis of the New York University&#x27;s journalism department selected &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company&quot; as the fifth best work of journalism in the United States in the 20th Century. In his 2008 book &quot;Taking on the Trust: The Epic Battle of Ida Tarbell and John D. Rockefeller&quot;, Steve Weinberg described the exposure of Standard Oil as &quot;arguably the greatest work of investigative journalism ever written&quot;.

In a 2010 column, libertarian-conservative economist Thomas Sowell criticized Tarbell for what he characterized as cherry picking which data to include in her book: &quot;One of the crucial facts left out of Ida Tarbell&#x27;s book was that Rockefeller&#x27;s improvements in the oil industry brought down the price of oil to a fraction of what it had been before.[...] Would the public have been better off if older and more costly methods of producing, processing and shipping oil had continued to be used, leading to prices far higher than necessary?&quot;

<text>Trireme Partners LLP was a US limited partnership venture capital company that invested in technology, goods, and services related to Homeland Security. The name &quot;Trireme&quot; was taken from a Greek warship designed with three banks of rowers.

Established by Richard Perle, Gerald Hillman and Christopher Harriman, Trireme Partners was a Delaware entity registered in November 2001. One of the firm&#x27;s major investors was Boeing, which invested US$20 million.

Perle became the subject of controversy in 2003 following a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article that alleged that Perle had offered to influence American foreign policy in Saudi Arabia in exchange for investment in Trireme.

Trireme Partners completed its business and dissolved in 2005.

== History and investors ==
Perle set up Trireme Partners in 2001. Trireme Partners first sought an investment from Boeing in February 2002. Boeing committed to invest $20 million two months later. The company received a $2.5 million investment from Hollinger International Inc. in 2003 which was reportedly never reported to the audit committee.

== Criticism ==
In March 2003, Perle became embroiled in controversy after &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an article by Seymour Hersh describing a meeting between Perle, the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and Saudi businessman Harb Zuhair, in which Perle allegedly offered to influence American foreign policy in Saudi Arabia in exchange for investment in Trireme. The U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General investigated the conflict of interest and determined that Perle did not violate the conflict of interest provision because he was only working eight days per annum at the Defense Department at the time, which was less than the 60 days of service requirement.

<text>The North Dakota Republican Party is the North Dakota affiliate of the United States Republican Party.

Its platform is conservative. It is currently the dominant party in the state, controlling North Dakota&#x27;s at-large U.S. House seat, both U.S. Senate seats and the governorship, and it has supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature.

==History==
The state Republican Party has always been a major force in state politics, in many cases having a dominant position. Founded in 1889, the Party initially dominated all state politics for the state&#x27;s first 20 years of existence, with the exception of a brief period from 1893 to 1894 in which the North Dakota Democratic-Independent Party briefly overthrew the Republican Party.

In the early 20th century, the Party was effectively divided into two groups that nominated candidates on the Republican ticket, the progressive Non-Partisan League (NPL) and the conservative Independent Voters Association (IVA). This period ended when the NPL merged with the state Democratic Party, and the IVA effectively became known as the Republican Party.

The Party holds its convention in the spring of election years, usually rotating the convention between four of the state&#x27;s largest cities: Bismarck, Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot.

===Notable figures===
*Doug Burgum - United States Secretary of the Interior and candidate for president in 2024
*Thomas S. Kleppe - former United States Secretary of the Interior
*Milton Young - United States Senator who served as President pro tempore for a day
*Ed Schafer - former Governor of North Dakota and former United States Secretary of Agriculture

==Current elected officials==
The North Dakota Republican Party controls all twelve of the statewide offices and holds supermajorities in both the North Dakota Senate and the North Dakota House of Representatives. Republicans also hold both of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats and the state&#x27;s at-large congressional district.

<text>Kinder High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (Kinder HSPVA, HSPVA or PVA) is a secondary school located at 790 Austin Street in the downtown district of Houston, Texas. The school is a part of the Houston Independent School District.

The school provides education for grades nine through twelve. The school is divided into six departments: instrumental music, vocal music, dance, theater (including technical theater), visual arts, and creative writing.

HSPVA was placed as the top school in the Greater Houston Area by Children at Risk&#x27;s 2009 annual ranking of high schools, and it has continued to be ranked as an &quot;A&quot; grade or higher by Children at Risk. Since 2003, HSPVA has had eight students named US Presidential Scholars in the Arts (Presidential Scholars Program) by the US Department of Education as selected by the National YoungArts Foundation (YoungArts).

As a Magnet school, HSPVA does not automatically enroll students from the surrounding neighborhood; the surrounding neighborhood is zoned to Northside High School.

==Art areas==
There are six art areas: vocal music, instrumental music, dance, theatre, visual art, and creative writing. There are subdivisions within some of these art areas. Instrumental Music breaks down into band, orchestra, jazz, mariachi, and piano. Theatre breaks down into musical theatre, acting, and technical theatre.

==History==
HSPVA was established in 1971. 

HISD chose Ruth Denney as the school&#x27;s founding director. The district asked Denney to choose between three potential sites: W. D. Cleveland Elementary School, Montrose Elementary School, and the former Temple Beth Israel building. After touring them, Denney selected the temple building and in May 1971 the final plans for HSPVA were presented to the school board.

Parents rallied against a planned move to Timbergrove Manor due to its lack of proximity to Downtown Houston, artist landmarks, and the Houston Museum District, even though the district had already paid $500,000 for planning as of 1979. The school moved to 4001 Stanford Street, the site of the former Montrose Elementary School, in 1982. The cost was $1.3 million, and the HISD board had given the green light to the move the previous year. Keith Plocek of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote that partly due to the 9th grade being reassigned to the high school level in 1981, &quot;The building on Stanford Street was overcrowded from the get-go&quot; as the facility was only intended for grades 10-12. The HSPVA Friends booster club stated an intention to raise funds to recoup the money used for the Timbergrove site planning; according to the group, the district and HSPVA Friends had conflicting interpretations of their accord in the said recouping, and Plocek stated &quot;The Friends never really paid much of the bill&quot;.

By the late 1990s parents advocated for another move due to overpopulation, but again rejected the idea of the Timbergrove site due to the lack of proximity. In the 1990s, there was a proposal to move HSPVA to the Bob R. Casey Federal Building in Downtown Houston. HISD later proposed moving the school near the Gregory-Lincoln Education Center in Houston&#x27;s Freedmen&#x27;s Town Historical District in the Fourth Ward. HISD officials agreed to pursue a relocation at that time as Friends of HSPVA agreed to raise about 50% of a projected $30 million cost to develop a new site; otherwise HISD officials were reluctant to promote building a new HSPVA when there were schools with campuses in much worse repair.

The Fourth Ward building would have included a 2000+ seat state-of-the-art theater, updated facilities and possibly a recording studio. Construction was temporarily delayed due to the discovery of a possible American Civil War-era cemetery. In June 2007, the project page for the building displayed &quot;CANCELLED.&quot; The site that was to have the new HSPVA instead has the new Carnegie Vanguard High School.

=== Naming discussion ===
On October 13, 2016, the Houston Independent School District Board of Trustees voted 7 to 2 to accept a naming rights contract from the Kinder Foundation for a $7.5 million for capital improvements to the new facility. The school&#x27;s name was to become Kinder High School for the Performing and Visual Arts when the school moved to the new downtown location. The Kinder funds provide primarily upgrades to theater equipment and some performance spaces, such as outfitting the mini-theater.

The contract was approved by the school board after the Kinder Foundation said it would withdraw the funds if the board did not vote, six days after the public announcement of the deal.

One HISD board member, Jolanda Jones, spoke against the deal, arguing that it was selling out the rights to name a school and that HISD was not giving attention to the non-specialty schools in the district. Jones and Diana Davila were the only board members to vote against the deal. Most speakers at the board meeting, including community members and HSPVA students and parents, supported the deal (17 speakers in favor, 11 against).

In April 2017, in response to a petition asking the Kinders to give the name back, Richard Kinder wrote to the superintendent of Houston Independent School District. Citing negative controversy, he offered to release the naming rights, but did not suggest or request the school&#x27;s name be restored. By contract, the name change became effective when the new downtown campus was occupied.

===New campus===
In January 2019, HSPVA moved from its Montrose campus to the downtown site at 790 Austin Street. The former campus now houses the Arabic Immersion Magnet School.

==Demographics==
The demographics for the 2017 - 2018 school year are listed below.

 Anglo white students made up less than 50% of the student body, and the three ZIP codes with the highest numbers of students in HSPVA included Meyerland, Montrose, and the West University areas. The HSPVA student body had a higher percentage of Anglo white students than that of HISD as a whole. That year 15% of the students were low income. HSPVA historically had higher rates of minority enrollment as it had affirmative action policies, but these policies were withdrawn after 1997.

==Campus==
A block in Downtown Houston is the new location for HSPVA. It formerly housed Sam Houston High School; at a later point the building housed the HISD headquarters. The building is five stories and in size, at a cost of $88.4 million. Gensler Architects designed the building. Groundbreaking occurred on December 14, 2014.

The previous campus was on Blocks 12 and 13 of the Lockard Connor and Barziza Addition, in Montrose. , many students practiced their creative arts in the school hallway due to the small size of the campus. Many Montrose-area residents attended performances even though they do not have children enrolled in the school. Students sometimes traveled to area cafes and restaurants after the official end of the school day but before additional rehearsals.

==Admissions patterns==
HSPVA has no actual feeder patterns. Since it is a magnet school it takes students from all over HISD, and from districts outside of HISD.

HSPVA takes students from many HISD middle schools. In addition, some students who are enrolled in private schools in the 8th grade, such as St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal School, Presbyterian School, River Oaks Baptist School, John Paul II School, and Annunciation Orthodox School, choose to go to HSPVA for high school.

<text>Ram Boolchand Jethmalani (14 September 1923 – 8 September 2019) was an Indian lawyer and politician. He served as India&#x27;s Union Minister of Law and Justice, as chairman of the Indian Bar Council, and as the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association. 

Jethmalani obtained his LL.B. degree at the age of 17 and started practising law in his hometown, Shikarpur, until the partition of India. The partition led him to move to Mumbai as a refugee where he began his life and career afresh. He announced his retirement from judicial profession in 2017.

Throughout his political career, Jethmalani worked for improving the relations between India and Pakistan, owing to his experiences as a refugee post-partition. He was elected as member of the Lok Sabha twice, contensting from Janata Party, from the Mumbai North West constituency. He also served as the Union Minister of Urban Development in the first Atal Bihari Vajpayee ministry, against whom he later contested election in the 2004 Indian general elections from the Lucknow constituency. He later returned to BJP in 2010, and was elected to the Rajya Sabha on its ticket.

Jethmalani was awarded the Human Rights Award by World Peace Through Law in 1977. He authored books such as &quot;Big Egos, Small Men&quot;; &quot;Conscience of a Maverick&quot;; and &quot;Maverick: Unchanged, Unrepentant&quot;; among others. He also co-authored legal scholarly books on different fields of law.

== Personal life ==
Jethmalani was born on 14 September 1923 in Shikarpur, Sindh in the Sindh division of the then Bombay Presidency (today a part of Pakistan) to Boolchand Gurmukhdas Jethmalani and Parbati Boolchand. He got a double promotion in school and completed matriculation at the age of 13. At the age of 17 he secured an LL.B. degree from the Bombay University with a first class distinction. At that time, the minimum age for becoming a lawyer was 21, but a special exception (resulting from an application that he made to the court contesting the rule regarding minimum age) allowed him to become a lawyer at the age of 18. He received his LL.M. from Bombay University, since Sindh did not have a university of its own at that time.

Jethmalani married his first wife, Durga, in a traditional Indian arranged marriage, around the age of 18. In 1947, just before the partition of India, he married his second wife, Ratna Shahani, a lawyer by profession. His family includes both of his wives and four children – three by Durga (Rani, Shobha, Mahesh) and one by Ratna (Janak). Among his two sons and two daughters, Mahesh and Rani have been supreme court lawyers while Mahesh is also a BJP leader, and Rani a social activist. Kamna Jethmalani, an actress in Telugu and Tamil films is a relative of him. She is the granddaughter of one of his brothers.

Jethmalani died on 8 September 2019 in New Delhi at his home at the age of 95. According to his son Mahesh Jethmalani, he had been unwell for the last few months of his life, and died at 7:45 am (IST), six days short of his 96th birthday.

== Career ==
=== Legal career ===
Ram Jethmalani started his career as a lawyer and Professor in Sindh before partition. He started his own law firm in Karachi with his friend A.K. Brohi who was senior to him by seven years. In February 1948, when riots broke out in Karachi, he fled to India on the advice of his friend Brohi and when he came to India in that day he had only INR 10 in his pocket and with that note he stayed in the refugee camp for few days.

Jethmalani fought his first case at the age of 17 in the court of Sindh under Justice Godfrey Davis, contesting the rule regarding minimum age passed by the Bar Council of Sindh. In a talk at Algebra in June 2017, Jethmalani recounted his first case fought in India as a refugee. The newly introduced Bombay Refugees Act treated refugees in an inhumane manner, against which Jethmalani filed a case in the Bombay High Court, praying for the law to be declared unconstitutional, a case he won.

Jethmalani later came to be noted for his appearance in the Nanavati case in 1959 with Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud, who was later to become the Chief Justice of India. His defence of a string of smugglers in the late 1960s established his image as a &quot;smuggler’s lawyer&quot;, to which he mentioned that he was only doing his duty as a lawyer.

In 1954, he became a part-time Professor at the Government Law College, Mumbai for both graduate and post graduate studies. He also taught comparative law at the Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. He has been the Chairman of Bar Council of India for four tenures, before as well as after the emergency. In 1996, he also became a member of the International Bar Association. He has served as the Professor Emeritus for Symbiosis International University law schools. In 2010, he was also elected as the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association.

During his career he was involved in a number of high-profile defence cases as lawyer – people involved in market scams (Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh), and a host of gangsters and smugglers including the British citizen Daisy Angus who was acquitted of hashish smuggling after serving five years in jail. He also defended L. K. Advani in the Hawala scam. He was in the news for taking up the defence of Manu Sharma, prime accused in the Jessica Lall murder case; however, he failed to get Manu Sharma acquitted. He was to be defending Lalit Modi, former Indian Premier League chairman and commissioner. Some of the cases Jethmalani appeared in include — the defence of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s alleged assassins, challenging the medical evidence deposed of Tirath Das Dogra, a forensic expert of AIIMS, on record; defending Harshad Mehta in a stock market scam and the Narasimha Rao bribery case; defending Ketan Parekh in a stock market scam; appearing in a case involving Mumbai mafia gang leader, Haji Mastan; speaking on record against the death sentence of Afzal Guru, though he had not taken up the case; defending L K Advani in the Hawala scam; defending Manu Sharma in Jessica Lall&#x27;s murder; defending Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin encounter case; defending Amit Jogi in the Jaggi murder case; appearing for Sanjay Chandra&#x27;s bail in the 2G spectrum case; appearing for Kulbhushan Parashar&#x27;s bail in the navy war room leak case; defending Kanimozhi in the 2G spectrum case; appearing in Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy&#x27;s special leave petition on stay for C.B.I. probe into money laundering in his companies; appearing in Yeddyurappa&#x27;s case on an illegal mining scam; defending A. G. Perarivalan, T Suthendraraja alias Santhan, and Sriharan alias Murugan, all convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case; defending Ramdev in case of allaged use of force on his followers at Ramlila grounds on 4 June 2011; defending Shiv Sena in Krishna Desai&#x27;s murder; defending Asaram Bapu in the Jodhpur sexual assault case; defending Lalu Prasad Yadav in the supreme court and appearing for his bail in the fodder scam case, on 13 December 2013; appearing for Subrata Roy in the Sahara-SEBI case; appearing for AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa, convicted in a disproportionate assets case by the Karnataka High Court; and, appearing for AAP president Arvind Kejriwal, in a defamation case filed by Arun Jaitley, among others.

On 9 September 2017, he announced his retirement from the legal profession.

=== Political career ===
Jethmalani&#x27;s experience during the partition as a refugee led him to advocate for better relations between India and Pakistan, which he sought throughout his political career. He contested as an independent candidate from Ulhasnagar supported both by the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Jan Sangh but he lost the elections. During the emergency period of 1975–1977, he was the chairman of the Bar Association of India. He heavily criticised then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. An arrest warrant was issued against him from Kerala which was stayed by the Bombay high court when over three hundred lawyers, led by Nani Palkhivala, appeared for him. However, the stay was nullified by the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; judgement in Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla. Jethmalani exiled himself in Canada carrying on his campaign against the emergency. He returned to India ten months later after the emergency was lifted. While in Canada, his candidature for the Parliament was filed from the Bombay North-West constituency. He won the election and retained the seat in 1980 general elections, but lost to Sunil Dutt in 1985. In the 1977 general elections after the emergency, he won against then serving Union law minister H. R. Gokhale from Bombay in the Lok Sabha elections, and hence started his political career as a parliamentarian. However he was not made law minister himself as Morarji Desai disapproved of his lifestyle.

He became a member of the Rajya Sabha in 1988 and the Union minister of law, justice and company affairs in 1996, in the cabinet of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. During the second tenure of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in 1998, he was given the portfolio of Union minister of urban affairs and employment. But on 13 October 1999 he was again sworn in as the Union minister for law, justice and company affairs. He was asked to resign by the prime minister following differences with then chief justice of India Adarsh Sein Anand and Attorney General of India Soli Sorabjee. He was inducted into the cabinet on home Minister Lal Krishna Advani&#x27;s insistence.

He had also announced his candidature for President of India stating: &quot;I owe it to the nation to offer my services&quot;. He launched his own political fronts, the Bharat Mukti Morcha, as a &quot;mass movement&quot; in 1987. In 1995, he launched his own political party called the Pavitra Hindustan Kazhagam, with the motto to achieve &quot;transparency in functioning of Indian democracy&quot;.

In the general elections of 2004, he contested against Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the Lucknow constituency as an independent candidate. The Indian National Congress did not field their candidates in this election; however, he lost. Later on, in 2010, he was given a Rajya Sabha ticket by Bharatiya Janta Party from Rajasthan and he was elected. He was also a member of the Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice. Jethmalani has been criticised as being &quot;opportunistic&quot; as a result of this. Jethmalani was noted for speaking his mind; at a reception hosted by the Pakistan High Commission for the Pakistan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar who was on a visit to India on 28 July 2011, Jethmalani in the presence of the Chinese ambassador called China an enemy of both India and Pakistan and warned the Indians and Pakistanis to beware of the Chinese.

In December 2009, the Committee on Judicial Accountability stated that it considered that recommendations for judicial appointments should only be made after a public debate, including review by members of the bar of the affected high courts. This statement was made in relation to controversy about the appointments of justices C. K. Prasad and P. D. Dinakaran. The statement was signed by Jethmalani, Shanti Bhushan, Fali Sam Nariman, Anil B. Divan, Kamini Jaiswal and Prashant Bhushan.

In 2012, Jethmalani wrote to then Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) President Nitin Gadkari, accusing opposition BJP leaders of being &quot;silent against the huge corruption&quot; within the ruling UPA-II government, and stated that BJP &quot;is sick&quot;. Jethmalani&#x27;s letter became public on the internet. The same year, in November, Jethmalani stated &quot;When there are serious allegations against Gadkari, he should have stayed away, if only to raise his stature in the public eye&quot;. He also said &quot;I am sure the RSS is trying to influence the functioning of the BJP. After all, BJP leaders have grown up with the RSS&quot;.

In May 2013, BJP expelled Jethmalani from the party for six years, for having made anti-party statements. In October 2013, defamation charges were framed against BJP seeking as &quot;null and void and damages&quot; for making a statement that he was not a fit person to be member of the party.

===Later Life===

Jethmalani stepped into the role of an elder statesman, but took action on occasion, as he was also India&#x27;s oldest practising lawyer. In 2017, he wrote an open letter to Justice C. S. Karnan, of the Calcutta High Court, who was embroiled in controversy:

Karnan retired shortly thereafter. 

Jethmalani died in 2019. Many former colleagues wrote remembrances of him.

<text>Genghis Blues is a 1999 American documentary film directed by Roko Belic. It centers on the journey of blind American singer Paul Pena to the isolated Russian Republic of Tuva to pursue his interest in Tuvan throat singing.

==Accolades==
It won the 1999 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for a Documentary. It was also nominated for an Academy Award in 2000 in the Best Documentary Feature category.

==Synopsis==
The documentary captures the story of blind blues musician Paul Pena. After a brush with fame and success in the 1970s, Pena&#x27;s fortunes faded as he dealt with career and health problems.

While listening to shortwave radio, Pena heard a broadcast of Tuvan throat singing, the art of manipulating overtones while singing to make higher frequencies more distinguishable, essentially making it possible to sing two notes at once. Pena, over the course of several years, taught himself to throat sing to a very impressive degree. He eventually attended a concert of throat singing and, after the concert, impressed one of the throat singers, Kongar-ol Ondar, who invited him to visit Tuva, a republic of the Russian Federation and a formerly independent country from 1921 to 1944, under the name of the People&#x27;s Republic of Tannu Tuva, and the home of throat singing, to sing in the triennial throat singing festival held there.

The entire journey, as well as the extraordinary mix of cultures and music, is captured in the documentary.

==Production==
The Belic brothers shot the film with two Hi8 camcorders and edited it themselves. They were allowed to edit the film during nighttime at a professional editing facility. It took them three and a half years to finish the film after they shot it. All this time they lived on $500 a month in an apartment above an auto repair shop. Christopher Nolan, a longtime friend of the brothers, is credited for his &quot;editorial assistance.&quot;

<text>Thermophobia (adjective: thermophobic) is intolerance for high temperatures by either inorganic materials or organisms. The term has a number of specific usages.

In pharmacy, a thermophobic foam consisting of 0.1% betamethasone valerate was found to be at least as effective as conventional remedies for treating dandruff. In addition, the foam is non-greasy and does not irritate the scalp. Another use of thermophobic material is in treating hyperhydrosis of the axilla and the palm: A thermophobic foam named Bettamousse developed by Mipharm, an Italian company, was found to treat hyperhydrosis effectively.

In biology, some bacteria are thermophobic, such as &quot;mycobacterium leprae&quot; which causes leprosy. Thermophobic response in living organisms is negative response to higher temperatures.

In physics, thermophobia is motion of particles in mixtures (solutions, suspensions, etc.) towards the areas of lower temperatures, a particular case of thermophoresis.

In medicine, thermophobia refers to a sensory dysfunction, sensation of abnormal heat, which may be associated with, e.g., hyperthyroidism.

<text>Colzium House and Estate (pronounced Coal-Zee-Um) is about 500 metres to the north-east of Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The present house dates from 1783 and was extended and modernised in 1861. The name may mean &quot;defile leap&quot;.

W Mackay Lennox bought Colzium House and its policies in 1930 and in 1937, on his retiral as Town Clerk, he presented them to Kilsyth Burgh, in memory of his mother. The house and estate are principally used for public recreation, as the venue for the annual Kilsyth International Carnival in mid August, an &quot;Italian Picnic&quot; – a gathering of Italian/Scottish families, and functions such as weddings and parties. There is also a fine walled garden and a small theatre, the &quot;clock theatre&quot;. A children&#x27;s adventure playground has been opened.

The estate still contains the ruins of Colzium Castle just 100 metres north of Colzium House at the point where the driveway turns sharp left to Tak-Ma-Doon Road. The first building here was a large L-plan castle built by the Livingstons of Callendar in the mid-15th century to replace the ancient motte. A substantial hall block was added in 1575. 

The castle was demolished by the 3rd Viscount of Kilsyth in 1703, immediately prior to his accession to the title. The family lost the estate due to their Jacobite sympathies, and it then became the property of the Edmonstone family from Duntreath.

There is an ice house c. 1680 in the glen of the Colzium Burn which was excavated in 1977 and may still be viewed. The estate also contains the oldest curling ponds in the world. Kilsyth Curling Club, the world&#x27;s first recorded curling club, was founded in Kilsyth in 1716.

The Battle of Kilsyth (1645) in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms was fought just a kilometre to the east. A ring, supposed to be the one lost by Lady Kilsyth, was reported to be kept at the house.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine , commissioned in 1963, was powered by an American Westinghouse S5W reactor, provided to Britain under the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

== PWR1 ==

The first British naval reactor was the PWR1. It was based on a core and reactor assembly of purely British design. The reactor first went critical in 1965, four years later than planned. Technology transfers under the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement eventually made Rolls-Royce entirely self-sufficient in reactor design in exchange for a &quot;considerable amount&quot; of information regarding submarine design and quietening techniques being passed on to the United States.

The reactor fuel was highly enriched uranium (HEU) enriched to between 93% and 97%. Each nuclear core had a life of about 10 years, so had to be refueled about twice during the lifetime of a submarine.

Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations at Derby was the centre for design and manufacture of the UK&#x27;s submarine reactors, and remains so today. The Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment (NRTE), at Dounreay, tested each reactor core design prior to its installation in nuclear submarines.

== PWR2 ==
The PWR2 was developed for the Trident missile submarines and is a development of the PWR1. The first PWR2 reactor was completed in 1985 with testing beginning in August 1987 at the Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment.

The reactor fuel is highly enriched uranium (HEU) enriched to between 93% and 97%. The latest PWR2 reactor core design is &quot;Core H&quot;, which has a life of about 30 years removing the need for refueling, allowing a submarine to avoid two reactor refits in its service life. HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; was fitted with the new core during its refit, followed by her three sister boats. The s have this full-life core installed. As they were developed for SSBNs, the reactors are considerably larger than those of then-current British fleet submarines. The diameter of then-forthcoming &quot;Astute&quot;-class hulls was therefore increased to accommodate the PWR2.

A safety assessment of the PWR2 design by the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator in November 2009 was released under a Freedom of Information request in March 2011. The regulator identified two major areas where UK practice fell significantly short of comparable good practice: loss-of-coolant accident and control of submarine depth following emergency reactor shutdown. The regulator concluded that PWR2 was &quot;potentially vulnerable to a structural failure of the primary circuit&quot;, which was a failure mode with significant safety hazards to crew and the public.

In January 2012 radiation was detected in the PWR2 test reactor&#x27;s coolant water, caused by a microscopic breach in fuel cladding. This discovery led to being refueled early and contingency measures being applied to other &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Astute&quot;-class submarines, at a cost of £270 million. This was not revealed to the public until 2014.

In February 2013, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) awarded Rolls-Royce a £800 million ten year &quot;foundation&quot; contract to &quot;deliver and maintain&quot; the reactors of the &quot;Astute&quot;-class and the &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class replacement the Successor. In February 2019, the MoD awarded Rolls-Royce a £235 million three year contract for Nuclear Propulsion Lifetime Management for the &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Astute&quot; classes.

==PWR3==
Three propulsion options were considered for the replacement of the &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class, the Successor: PWR2, PWR2b (derivative with improved performance) and PWR3. PWR3 was a new system &quot;based on a US design but using UK reactor technology&quot;. The Royal Institution of Naval Architects reported that it was likely that the UK was given access to the US Navy S9G reactor design used in their &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines. The PWR3 was a simpler and safer design with a longer life and lower maintenance requirements than the PWR2 variants and cost roughly the same as the PWR2b. The PWR3 has 30% fewer parts compared to the PWR2.

In March 2011, Defence Secretary Liam Fox said the PWR3 was the preferred option &quot;because those reactors give us a better safety outlook&quot;. In May 2011, the Ministry of Defence announced that PWR3 had been selected for the Successor (later named the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;-class in 2016). The PWR3 cost about £50 million more per boat to purchase and operate compared to PWR2 designs. This is offset by the PWR3&#x27;s longer life over the 25-year life PWR2 designs. The PWR3 does not require reactor core prototype tests; instead computational modelling is used. Consequently, the Shore Test Facility (STF) reactor located at Vulcan NRTE was shut down in 2015.

In June 2012, the MoD awarded Rolls-Royce a £600 million contract to produce reactors for the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;-class and also for the final boat of the &quot;Astute&quot;-class HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot;. The MoD also awarded Rolls-Royce a further £500 million to refurbish their Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations reactor core manufacturing plant at Derby to manufacture the PWR3 and to extend the plant&#x27;s operational life to 2056. In January 2020, the National Audit Office reported that the construction of the plant was five years behind schedule and was now forecast to be in service in 2026.

In 2025, the MoD awarded Rolls-Royce a £9 billion eight-year contract, named Unity, covering research, design, manufacture, and support for Royal Navy nuclear submarine reactors. Defence Secretary John Healey said &quot;This investment in Britain’s defence will deliver a long-term boost to British business, jobs and national security.&quot;

<doc id="584809" wikidata="Q772046" url="?curid=584809" title="Art for art's sake">
<text>Art for art&#x27;s sake—the usual English rendering of (), a French slogan from the latter half of the 19th century—is a phrase that expresses the philosophy that &#x27;true&#x27; art is utterly independent of all social values and utilitarian functions, be they didactic, moral, or political. Such works are sometimes described as &quot;autotelic&quot; (from Greek: &quot;autoteles&quot;, &#x27;complete in itself&#x27;), a concept also applied to &quot;inner-directed&quot; or &quot;self-motivated&quot; persons.

The phrase is sometimes used commercially. A Latin version of this phrase, (), is used as a motto by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio, appearing in the film scroll around the roaring head of Leo the Lion in its logo.

== History ==

The phrase &quot;&quot; had been used by Parisian intellectuals since the beginning of the 19th century, but it was Théophile Gautier (1811–1872) who first fully articulated its current metaphysical meaning in the prefaces of his 1832 poetry volume &quot;Albertus&quot; and 1835 novel &quot;Mademoiselle de Maupin&quot;.

The phrase also appeared in the lectures and writings of Victor Cousin and Benjamin Constant. In his essay &quot;The Poetic Principle&quot; (1850) Edgar Allan Poe argues:

We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem&#x27;s sake ... and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force:– but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem&#x27;s sake.

&quot;Art for the sake of art&quot; became a bohemian creed in the 19th century; a slogan raised in defiance of those—from John Ruskin to the later Communist advocates of socialist realism—who thought that the value of art was to serve some moral or didactic purpose. It was a rejection of the Marxist aim of politicising art. &quot;Art for the sake of art&quot; affirmed that art was valuable in itself; that artistic pursuits did not need moral justification, and indeed, could legitimately be morally neutral or subversive.

James McNeill Whistler wrote the following, deprecating the accustomed role of art in the service of the state or official religion, as had been common practice since the Counter-Reformation of the 16th century: &quot;Art should be independent of all claptrap – should stand alone...and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love, patriotism and the like.&quot; In this brusque dismissal, the artist also rejected sentimentalism. All that remains of Romanticism in this statement is the reliance on the artist&#x27;s own eye and sensibility as the arbiter.

In English art and letters, the slogan is associated with Walter Pater and his Aesthetic Movement, which self-consciously rebelled against Victorian moralism. It first appeared in print in English in two works of 1868: Pater&#x27;s review of William Morris&#x27;s poetry in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, and Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s study &quot;William Blake&quot;. However, William Makepeace Thackeray had used the term privately in an 1839 letter to his mother in which he recommended Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Miscellanies&quot;, writing that Carlyle had done more than any other to give &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake ... its independence.&quot; A modified form of Pater&#x27;s review appeared in his &quot;Studies in the History of the Renaissance&quot; (1873), one of the most influential texts of the Aesthetic Movement.

Arnold Bennett made the facetious riposte: &quot;Am I to sit still and see other fellows pocketing two guineas apiece for stories which I can do better myself? Not me. If anyone imagines my sole aim is art for art&#x27;s sake, they are cruelly deceived.&quot;

In Germany, the poet Stefan George was one of the first artists to translate the phrase () and adopt it for his own literary programme, presented in the first volume of his literary magazine &quot;Blätter für die Kunst&quot; (1892). He was inspired mainly by Charles Baudelaire and the French Symbolists whom he had met in Paris, where he was friends with Albert Saint-Paul and consorted with the circle around Stéphane Mallarmé.

== Criticism ==

===By Nietzsche===

Friedrich Nietzsche argued that there is &#x27;no art for art&#x27;s sake&#x27;, the arts always express human values and communicate core beliefs:

When the purpose of moral preaching and of improving man has been excluded from art, it still does not follow by any means that art is altogether purposeless, aimless, senseless—in short, &#x27;, a worm chewing its own tail. &quot;Rather no purpose at all than a moral purpose!&quot;—that is the talk of mere passion. A psychologist, on the other hand, asks: what does all art do? does it not praise? glorify? choose? prefer? With all this it strengthens or weakens certain valuations. Is this merely a &quot;moreover&quot;? an accident? something in which the artist&#x27;s instinct had no share? Or is it not the very presupposition of the artist&#x27;s ability? Does his basic instinct aim at art, or rather at the sense of art, at life? at a desirability of life? Art is the great stimulus to life: how could one understand it as purposeless, as aimless, as &#x27;?

=== By Marxists and socialists ===

Marxists have argued that art should be politicised for the sake of transmitting the socialist message.

George Sand, who was not a Marxist but a socialist writer, wrote in 1872 that &quot;&quot; was an empty phrase, an idle sentence. She asserted that artists had a &quot;duty to find an adequate expression to convey it to as many souls as possible,&quot; ensuring that their works were accessible enough to be appreciated.

Senegalese president, head of the Socialist Party of Senegal, and co-founder of Negritude, Leopold Sedar Senghor, and anti-colonial Africanist writer Chinua Achebe have both criticised the slogan as being a limited and Eurocentric view on art and creation. Senghor argued that, in &quot;black African aesthetics,&quot; art is &quot;functional&quot; and that in &quot;black Africa, &#x27;art for art&#x27;s sake&#x27; does not exist.&quot; Achebe is more scathing in his collection of essays and criticism entitled &quot;Morning Yet on Creation Day&quot;, in which he asserts that &quot;art for the sake of art is just another piece of deodorised dog shit [sic].&quot;

Walter Benjamin, one of the developers of Marxist hermeneutics, discusses the slogan in his seminal 1936 essay &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot;. He first mentions it in regard to the reaction within the realm of traditional art to innovations in reproduction, in particular photography. He even terms the &quot;&#x27;&quot; slogan as part of a &quot;theology of art&quot; in bracketing off social aspects. In the Epilogue to his essay, Benjamin discusses the links between fascism and art. His main example is that of Futurism and the thinking of its mentor Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. One of the slogans of the Futurists was &quot;Fiat ars – pereat mundus&quot; (&#x27;Let art be created, though the world perish&#x27;). Provocatively, Benjamin concludes that as long as fascism expects war &quot;to supply the artistic gratification of a sense of perception that has been changed by technology,&quot; then this is the &quot;consummation,&quot; the realization, of &quot;&#x27;.&quot;

Diego Rivera, who was a member of the Mexican Communist Party and &quot;a supporter of the revolutionary cause,&quot; claims that the art for the sake of art theory would further divide the rich from the poor. Rivera goes on to say that since one of the characteristics of so called &quot;pure art&quot; was that it could only be appreciated by a few superior people, the art movement would strip art from its value as a social tool and ultimately make art into a currency-like item that would only be available to the rich.

Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong said: &quot;There is in fact no such thing as art for art&#x27;s sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause; they are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine.&quot;

<text>The North Dakota Democratic Party was a political party in North Dakota that existed from the state&#x27;s formation in 1889 until 1956, when the party merged with the Non Partisan League to form the modern North Dakota Democratic NPL Party.

For most of its history until its merger with the NPL, the Democratic Party was a distant competitor for votes; between the founding of the state and 1956, just 3 out of 24 governors: John Burke (1907–1913), Thomas H. Moodie (1935), and John Moses (1937–1945) were Democrats.

<text>The Bramalea City Centre is a large shopping mall located in the city of Brampton, Ontario, Canada. With over a 1.5 million square feet of retail space and more than 300 outlets, it is one of Canada&#x27;s largest shopping malls. Regarded as a super regional mall, the Bramalea City Centre has a market of more than 500,000 residents and attracts 16 million visitors annually. The Bramalea City Centre is located near the intersection of Queen Street and Dixie Road, just east of Highway 410.

==History==
In the 1960s, planners in what was then Chinguacousy Township implemented a master plan to develop a new town called Bramalea. Included in this master plan was a series of residential areas, industrial development, open parks, and among other things, a central shopping centre. An 85-acre site, situated in the heart of Bramalea, was designated for mall development. Bramalea Consolidated Developments Limited (later shortened to Bramalea Limited in 1976), the local real estate developer responsible for developing much of Bramalea since the late 1950s, began mall construction towards the end of the decade on what was then the largest retail development in North America.

The first phase of construction entailed the &quot;service centre&quot; portion of the mall at the north end, about 75,000 square feet consisting of a Food City grocery store, LCBO, and various other small shops and offices, completed by 1971. The second phase added 600,000 square feet of mall space, including a two-level Eaton&#x27;s (120,000 square feet total, officially opened October 7, 1971 while the rest of the mall was still under construction), the two-level main mall corridor of 300,000 square feet stretching east to another anchor store yet to have a tenant (The Bay would end up occupying this space, with 131,000 square feet on two levels), and Steinberg&#x27;s retail space to the south, consisting of an 80,000-square-foot Miracle Mart department store and a 20,000-square-foot Miracle Food Mart supermarket, both next to each other on the upper level (later operated together as a Miracle Beaucoup).
Construction was completed in 1973, as the surrounding landscape experienced rapid change as the result of a population boom. The Bramalea City Centre had its grand opening on March 28, 1973; this was only four years after Brampton&#x27;s first mall, Shoppers World Brampton, opened its doors in 1969. Initially opening with 160 outlets, Bramalea City Centre housed various retail stores, large anchor store tenants, grocery stores, restaurants and even a hardware store and a movie theatre (Bramalea Cinemas, closed in the late 1980s when Odeon moved to Gateway 6 Cinemas). The nearby Bramalea Civic Centre was also constructed around this time in the early 1970s, housing various municipal government offices, a theatre and the Brampton Public Library&#x27;s Chinguacousy branch. There was a short tunnel under Team Canada Dr. connecting the mall and Civic Centre outside areas, visible in early aerial imagery but since removed.

Although Chinguacousy Township (and thus Bramalea) was amalgamated with Brampton in 1974, the Bramalea City Centre retained the name of the satellite community in which it was built. Mall expansion continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s under Bramalea Limited and Trizec Corporation (under Trilea Centers Inc) ownership and operation, including a northwest wing extension for the present Sears store location, and new bus terminal in 1991. A $6.5-million 150-room Holiday Inn hotel (started construction in 1978, owned by Bramalea Ltd and run by Holiday Inn), various separate external stores, and the Region of Peel office buildings were built within the malls&#x27; site boundaries, but were not directly connected to the main mall.

Bramalea Limited underwent financial hardships in the early 1990s recession that forced the company to start to liquidate much of its real estate holdings (shopping malls, hotels, office towers, etc.) to try to remain a going concern, but eventually the company went into bankruptcy in April 1995, and a number of creditors acquired various real estate holdings. Ownership of the Bramalea City Centre (at the time 100% owned by Bramalea Ltd) went to the Toronto-Dominion Bank. In 1997, shareholder Gentra Inc. bought the rest of TD&#x27;s stake in the mall. In 2002, the Bramalea City Centre was acquired by its current joint owners, Canadian real estate firm Morguard Corporation and a third party institutional investor.

In 2004, the mall underwent a $165-million reconstruction to improve all common areas. The renovation was completed in eight months, a majority of which was done during the night while the mall was closed. Upper and ground level corridors at the southwest end of the mall mainly composed of smaller tenant stores were removed in favour of larger store space occupying these areas for Old Navy, Shoppers Drug Mart, and Best Buy. Additional renovation projects were carried out in 2005 and 2006, revamping the food court, escalators, and other areas of the mall. Petroff Partnership Architects was in charge of the redesign; construction was carried out by Vanbots Construction.

Another $165-million expansion project opened in September 2010. It created 417,292 square feet (38,767.7 m2) of underground parking space, six new pad buildings constructed on the property, 325,000 square feet (30,200 m2) of new retail area on two levels, a new architectural centerpiece at the northwest corner of the property, and relocated loading docks and chiller units.

The mall has housed several large retailers in the past. These include Sears (closed 2018), Eaton&#x27;s, Kmart (closed 1998), Zellers (closed 2012), Target (closed 2015), Miracle Mart, Food City, Kitchen Stuff Plus and Beaver Lumber.

Brampton Transit&#x27;s Bramalea Terminal was moved in 2010 from its original site on the southeast side of the mall to a location to the north, to accommodate the Züm bus rapid transit service on Queen Street.

In May 2023, the mall would celebrate its 50th anniversary by opening a time capsule that was kept dormant since 1998.

<text>Joseph Coleman (born November 22, 1955) is an American painter, illustrator, actor and performance artist. He has been described as the &quot;walking ghost of Old America&quot; by his wife, photographer Whitney Ward, for his over-riding interest in the historical arcana and personae that often populate his paintings. Of Coleman&#x27;s work, The New York Times wrote that, “If P. T. Barnum had hired Breughel or Bosch to paint sideshow banners, they might have resembled the art of Joe Coleman.” While Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Tagesspiegel&quot; said of Coleman, &quot;Like [George] Grosz in the 1920s, he holds a drastic mirror up to his own times.&quot;

Coleman lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. His apartment and studio, called the &quot;Odditorium&quot;, is a living museum to his obsessions; a collection of artifacts, objects and documents from wax museums, crime museums, churches, pathology museums and sideshows.

==Early life==
Coleman was born in Norwalk, Connecticut, to a World War II-veteran father and the daughter of a professional prizefighter. Coleman&#x27;s birth date (11/22/55) and childhood home address (99 Ward Street), which all feature palindromic numbers, has fed a lifelong obsession with duality, reflection and symmetry that is represented in his work; as in his 1994 painting &quot;Mommy/Daddy&quot;, a split portrait of his parents as two halves of the same body, standing over an image of his childhood home and the grave in which they are both buried. Coleman’s mother was a devout Catholic and, as a child, Coleman spent many hours in church. He would draw the stations of the cross in pencil using red crayon to represent the blood of the saints and Christ. Around age 5, his mother gave him a book of paintings by Hieronymous Bosch. Also obsessed with comics, especially EC Comics, he began drawing his own. He has said his first collector was Lady Bird Johnson, who bought a painting he made of garbage in 1965 for a children&#x27;s art collection, as part of her ‘beautification’ campaign.

In 1973 he moved to New York and supported himself by driving a cab. “Times Square was a red light district,” said Coleman. “I was a taxi driver back then, like Travis Bickle, but the stuff I saw in my taxi was way worse than that movie.” The street life he saw behind the wheel bled into his paintings and artwork from this period, which he described as ‘human-scapes’.

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
In 1977, he self-published two mini-comix and produced a portfolio of ten graphite on paper drawings (&quot;The Joe Coleman Portfolio&quot;) that with its depictions of outsiders, freak shows and both historical and present day tableau, showing life in all its raw, unfiltered, gory detail, set the tone, style and subject matter of his later work. His first professionally published work appeared in issues of &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot; and &quot;Dope Comix&quot;, two underground comics titles published by Kitchen Sink Press.

He attended the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York for two years. While at SVA he started performing with punk band The Steel Tips, who were immortalized in an early 1979 painting, styled as a sideshow banner. The Steel Tips played at CBGB, as well as in strip clubs, a prison, an insane asylum, and a benefit for female alcoholics held in a church.

In 1982, Coleman self-published a full-length comic book, &quot;The Mystery of Wolverine Woo-Bait&quot;.

=== Paintings ===
Taken as a whole, Joe Coleman&#x27;s body of paintings presents an ongoing exegesis of his life, influences, obsessions, family and friends with a particular focus on the pathological and the psychological, the sacred and the profane, pop culture and high art, and the inter-relations between them. He has painted portraits of a broad range of figures, both historical and contemporary, that include saints and sinners, writers (Edgar Allan Poe, Hunter S Thompson, Louis-Ferdinand Celine), artists (George Grosz, Adolf Wolfli), madmen (Charles Manson), actors (Leo Gorcey, Jayne Mansfield), murderers (Ed Gein, Mary Bell, Albert Fish), musicians (Hasil Adkins, Hank Williams, Captain Beefheart), visionaries, freaks (Johnny Eck, Joseph Merrick a.k.a. the Elephant Man). He has also painted portraits of obscure or controversial figures in American history (Boston Corbett; abolitionist John Brown; Swift Runner, a Cree Indian in the thrall of Wendigo psychosis). Over the years, he has also painted portraits of many of his closest friends, including tattoo artist, writer, and painter Jonathan Shaw, and motorcycle builder and stunt rider Indian Larry. He has also produced many self-portraits and numerous portraits of his wife and muse Whitney Ward.

The portrait paintings in particular are the fruit of Coleman&#x27;s voluminous research into his subjects, which he has often compared to an archeological dig to excavate their true nature. The portraits take the form of a large central figure surrounded by depictions of episodes in the lives of his subjects that contributed to the development of their pathology, and influenced the drives and motivations that determine the course of their lives.

Coleman did the original artwork for the posters for the movies &quot;&quot; and &quot;Charles Manson Superstar&quot;.

He paints mainly using acrylic on wood panel, using a one-hair brush and viewing his work through jeweler&#x27;s goggles. The smooth surface of the wood panel allows him to paint to an extraordinary level of microscopic detail. Through this painstaking process, he is able to paint an average of one square-inch a day. Coleman does not make sketches or preparatory drawings of his paintings before embarking on them. The paintings usually begin from one detail and grow almost organically. It takes Coleman between one and four years to complete a single painting.

There is a ritualistic aspect to his work and the process by which he completes it. The frames of his paintings are often decorated with symbols from his own personal iconography to contain the forces within. Sometimes items of clothing or other artifacts related to his subject matter are appended to the painting.

=== Patrons ===
Rather than sell his work through galleries and the art establishment, Coleman has long relied on a system of patronage common during the medieval and Renaissance periods that inform his work. He has long-standing personal relationships with collectors of paintings, who are often able to view the work-in-progress that they will acquire. His collectors have included Mickey Cartin, Iggy Pop, Johnny Depp, Jim Jarmusch, Leonardo DiCaprio, D.B. Doghouse, H.R. Giger, and Adam and Flora Hanft.

=== Exhibitions ===

The first exhibitions of Coleman&#x27;s paintings were held at Lower East Side and Soho art galleries, &quot;Wooster&quot;, &quot;Chronocide&quot;, &quot;Limbo&quot; and &quot;Civilian Warfare&quot;, in 1986 and 1987. Chronocide&#x27;s Bob Behrens would become Coleman&#x27;s first dealer. Victoria and Albert Museum curator David Owsley, whom Coleman had met after picking him up his cab, bought a piece from one of his shows at Chronicide and hung it next to a Breughel in his collection. Owsley would also introduce Coleman to Mickey Cartin, who became the biggest collector of his work and convinced him to stop driving a cab and devote himself to painting full-time. In the late ’80s and early ‘90s, Coleman had solo shows at Psychedelic Solution in Greenwich Village and Billy Shire&#x27;s gallery, La Luz de Jesus, on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. His first European show was held in 1998 at London&#x27;s The Horse Hospital, formerly a Victorian-era stable to house the sick horses of cab drivers.

In 2006, Coleman had a mid-career retrospective at New York&#x27;s Jack Tilton Gallery entitled &quot;Joe Coleman: 30 Paintings and a Selection from the Odditorium&quot;, curated by Steven Holmes. Among those who saw it were French journalist Clement Dirie who arranged for the show to travel to the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, in March 2007, and German curator Susanne Pfeffer, who invited Coleman to exhibit at the K-W Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin and commissioned David Woodard to pen an essay for the accompanying catalog.

For the K-W Institute show, now entitled &quot;Joe Coleman: Internal Digging&quot;, Pfeffer expanded the exhibit, to include all aspects of Coleman&#x27;s work, as a painter, performance artist and also as a curator of the Odditorium, his personal museum. Taking over all four floors of the K-W Institute, visitors entered the show by walking into a cavernous ground floor space occupied by the sights and sounds of the Odditorium, largely housed in three German circus wagons. Each subsequent floor featured a different aspect of Coleman&#x27;s oeuvre. Musician, actor, and outsider artist Bruno S., the star of Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Stroszek&quot;, was personally invited by Coleman to play the dinner following the exhibition&#x27;s public vernissage. The K-W Institute show is the largest and most comprehensive exhibition to date of Coleman&#x27;s work. New York&#x27;s Dickinson Gallery exhibited a number of Coleman&#x27;s paintings together with paintings by Hans Memling and other 15th century early Netherlandish painters, in a 2008 show entitled &quot;Devotio Moderno: Joe Coleman/Northern Primitives&quot;, to draw attention to both the devotional aspect and use of religious and a personal iconography in Coleman&#x27;s paintings. The show included the 1999 painting, &quot;The Book of Revelations&quot;, which depicted Coleman and his wife Whitney Ward, encircled by a rainbow and riding atop a demon. They are surrounded on either side by friends and family who attended their wedding at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, while their symbolizing enemies are pitching into the fires of hell below them. The frame of the painting is adorned with blood-stained pages of the Book of Revelation from a miniature bible.

Two years later, in 2010, Dickinson put on a solo show by Joe Coleman, &quot;Autoportrait&quot;, that included the first public viewing of &quot;Doorway To Joe&quot;, a life-size self-portrait Coleman had painted over the course of four years. &quot;Doorway to Joe&quot; was exhibited again, with its companion painting &quot;Doorway to Whitney&quot;, a life-size portrait of Whitney Ward, completed in 2015, and unveiled at Unrealism, a show of figurative art curated by Jeffrey Deitch and Larry Gagosian at Art Basel Miami in December 2015.

The two paintings also formed the center-piece of another large retrospective of Coleman&#x27;s work, entitled &quot;Doorway to Joe&quot;, held in 2017 at the Begovitch Gallery, California State University, Fullerton.

== Performance art ==

In the late 1970s Coleman developed a carnival geek/ mad preacher persona for his early performances called Professor Mombooze-o—a name that was an amalgamation of his mother (‘Mom’) and father (‘Booze-0’). Professor Mombooze-o, who was depicted in a 1986 painting, would appear in performance spaces in NY&#x27;s Lower East Side and, while ranting as a madman preacher, would bite the heads off of live mice and explode on stage.

On October 22, 1989, Coleman staged a performance as Professor Mombooze-o at the Boston Film/Video Foundation (BF/VF). It began with 20 minutes of black and white vintage porn projected onto a screen, at the end of which Coleman burst through the screen hanging upside down on a harness and screaming as fireworks strapped to his chest exploded, like a baby born through a trial of fire and brimstone. After his then-wife Nancy Pivar cut him down, as if cutting the umbilical chord, and extinguished the fire, Coleman ripped the rest of screen apart to reveal a dead goat also hanging upside down. He then pulled two live white mice from his pocket, announcing, &#x27;This is Mommy and Daddy&#x27;. He proceeded to bite the head off &#x27;Daddy&#x27; and spit it into the audience. Then did the same to &#x27;Mommy&#x27;, but swallowed the head. &quot;This is Joe Coleman&#x27;s stone ritualization of his mother&#x27;s death,&quot; a 1990 article in Spin magazine reported about the performance. &quot;Four days earlier, she had died of cancer.&quot; Fittingly, this would be the last ever appearance of Professor Mombooze-o.

When police and fireman arrived on the scene, they arrested Coleman, Pivar and BF/VF manager, Jeri Rossi. Coleman was charged under an arcane statute, which had not been used since the 1800s, citing him for &quot;possession of an infernal machine&quot;. He was fined $5000 for possessing and exploding fireworks and a further $300 for eating mice. The terms of his probation stipulated that he &quot;not eat any Massachusetts mice for a year&quot;.

Since 2017, Coleman has embarked on a series of spoken word performances accompanied by projections of the paintings. These have taken place in June 2017 at Salo Club, Paris, during three nights curated by director and actress, Asia Argento, as part of a show with Lydia Lunch and Weasel Walter&#x27;s Brutal Measures project at Club Berlin in New York and in November 2017 as part of Le Guess Who? festival in Utrecht, Netherlands.

Alongside his performance art, Joe Coleman has also appeared as an occasional actor, often playing the kind of misfits, outsiders, monsters and murderers who populate his paintings. In the early 1980s while attending the School of Visual Arts, he contributed to several avant-garde films by Manuel DeLanda, as a writer and actor, including &quot;Incontinence: A Diarrhetic Flow of Mismatches&quot; and &quot;Raw Nerves: A Lacanian Thriller&quot;.

Coleman appeared in two shorts associated with the Lower East Side film movement, the Cinema of Transgression. playing a serial killer in Jeri Cain Rossi&#x27;s 1992 short film, &quot;Black Hearts Bleed Red&quot;, an adaptation of Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s short story &quot;A Good Man Is Hard To Find&quot;, and Satan (to Sid Vicious bodyguard Rockets Redglare&#x27;s portrayal of Jesus) in Tommy Turner and David Wojnarowicz&#x27;s &quot;Where Evil Dwells,&quot; based on the 1984 murder of Ricky Kasso.

He played producer Barry Paar, a thinly veiled depiction of Harvey Weinstein, in Asia Argento&#x27;s 1998 loosely autobiographical directorial debut, &quot;Scarlet Diva&quot;, in a scene based on her alleged 1997 rape by Weinstein at the Cannes Film Festival.

Coleman had a cameo as John the Baptist in Dan Fogler and Michael Canzoniero&#x27;s 2014 feature, &quot;Don Peyote&quot;, a reimagining of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; as a stoner comedy, alongside a cast that included Anne Hathaway, Annabella Sciorra, Abel Ferrara, Topher Grace and Wallace Shawn.

In 2016 Coleman appeared as the title character in &quot;The Cruel Tale of the Medicine Man&quot;, alongside contemporary sideshow and burlesque performers including Mat Fraser and Julie Atlas Muz, directed by James Habacker, founder of New York City neo-burlesque venue, The Slipper Room.

He has also appeared in a number of documentaries, including films about two subjects of his paintings, Albert Fish and Carl Panzram. A performance by Professor Mombooze-o was featured in Harvey Nikolai Keith&#x27;s 1988 documentary &quot;Mondo New York&quot;, about the NYC underground art and music scene. The film also featured Lydia Lunch, Phoebe Legere, Ann Magnuson, Emilio Cubeiro and Joey Arias.

Coleman was also the subject of &quot;R.I.P: Rest in Pieces&quot;, a 1999 feature documentary by filmmaker Robert Adrien Pejo. In one of the film&#x27;s set pieces, he is shown performing an autopsy on a woman performed in Budapest, Hungary under the guidance of medical examiner Janos Keser, and later in the film visiting rockabilly icon, Hasil Adkins, (whom Coleman had previously made the subject of a 1993 painting) in his West Virginia home, and being interviewed by filmmaker Jim Jarmusch in a church.

2001 “Outsider Art /Music” at the Barbican Theatre, London, England presented two films created by Coleman featuring his paintings. The first film called &quot;Humanscapes&quot;, was accompanied by the music of Carlo Gesualdo, Coleman&#x27;s favorite medieval composer and performed by a live choir, The Clerk&#x27;s Group. The second film called &quot;Portraits&quot;, was accompanied by specially composed music performed live by The Delgados. A similar performance was presented at the Bergen International Festival in 2002 with an original score composed by the Norwegian band, Motorpsycho.

Joe Coleman &amp; his wife, Whitney Ward are the subjects of a new feature-length documentary film currently in production, entitled &quot;Doorway to Joe&quot;, directed by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker, Scott Gracheff.

<doc id="584820" wikidata="Q7565159" url="?curid=584820" title="Source port">
<text>A source port is a software project based on the source code of a game engine that allows the game to be played on operating systems or computing platforms with which the game was not originally compatible.

==Description==
Source ports are often created by fans after the original developer hands over the maintenance support for a game by releasing its source code to the public (see List of commercial video games with later released source code). In some cases, the source code used to create a source port must be obtained through reverse engineering, in situations where the original source was never formally released by the game&#x27;s developers. The term was coined after the release of the source code to Doom. Due to copyright issues concerning the sound library used by the original DOS version, id Software released only the source code to the Linux version of the game. Since the majority of Doom players were DOS users the first step for a fan project was to &quot;port&quot; the Linux &quot;source&quot; code to DOS. A source port typically only includes the engine portion of the game and requires that the data files of the game in question already be present on users&#x27; systems.

Source ports share the similarity with unofficial patches that both don&#x27;t change the original gameplay as such projects are by definition mods. However many source ports add support for gameplay mods, which is usually optional (e.g. DarkPlaces consists of a source port engine and a gameplay mod that are even distributed separately). While the primary goal of any source port is compatibility with newer hardware, many projects support other enhancements. Common examples of additions include support for higher video resolutions and different aspect ratios, hardware accelerated renderers (OpenGL and/or Direct3D), enhanced input support (including the ability to map controls onto additional input devices), 3D character models (in case of 2.5D games), higher resolution textures, support to replace MIDI with digital audio (MP3, Ogg Vorbis, etc.), and enhanced multiplayer support using the Internet.

Several source ports have been created for various games specifically to address online multiplayer support. Most older games were not created to take advantage of the Internet and the low latency, high bandwidth Internet connections available to computer gamers today. Furthermore, old games may use outdated network protocols to create multiplayer connections, such as IPX protocol, instead of Internet Protocol. Another problem was games that required a specific IP address for connecting with another player. This requirement made it difficult to quickly find a group of strangers to play with — the way that online games are most commonly played today. To address this shortcoming, specific source ports such as Skulltag added &quot;lobbies&quot;, which are basically integrated chat rooms in which players can meet and post the location of games they are hosting or may wish to join. Similar facilities may be found in newer games and online game services such as Valve&#x27;s Steam, Blizzard&#x27;s battle.net, and GameSpy Arcade.

==Alternatives ==
If the source code of a software is not available, alternative approaches to achieve portability are Emulation, Engine remakes, and Static recompilation.

<text>Eliyahu &quot;Eli&quot; Yishai (, born 26 December 1962) is an Israeli politician. A former leader of Shas, he represented the party in the Knesset from 1996 until 2015, also holding several ministerial posts, including being Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Internal Affairs, and Minister of Industry, Trade, and Labor. In December 2014, he left Shas to establish the Yachad party.

==Personal life==
Yishai was born in Jerusalem in 1962, to Zion (1933–2004) and Yvette-Fortuna Yishai (1934–2009), who had immigrated to Israel from Tunis in Tunisia. The second of seven children, he studied at the Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem, and Yeshivat HaNegev in Netivot. In 1980, Yishai enlisted in the IDF and served until 1983.

Yishai is married, and has five children.

==Political career==

===Shas===
In 1984, he entered political life. He became a member of Jerusalem City Council in 1987, although he left the council the following year. In 1988, Yishai served as an aide to Aryeh Deri who was then Minister of Internal Affairs. Although Yishai did not win a seat in the Knesset in the 1992 election, he was appointed the general secretary of Shas. He was first elected to the Knesset in the 1996 elections, after which he was made Minister of Labor and Social Welfare in Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s government.

He retained his seat in the 1999 elections, and was again appointed Minister of Labor and Social Welfare in Ehud Barak&#x27;s government. In 2000, Shas leader Deri was convicted of taking $155,000 in bribes while serving as Interior Minister and given a three-year jail sentence. Deri was replaced by Yishai as head of the party. Although Deri&#x27;s sentence was only for three years, the court ruled that he be banned from entering politics for ten years. As leader of Shas, Yishai was seen as a political hawk and steered the party to the right of where it had been under Deri. Yishai tried to recruit voters from the settlements and took the party out of Ehud Barak&#x27;s coalition government in advance of the Camp David summit with Yasser Arafat in 2000.

After Ariel Sharon defeated Barak in the 2001 elections for Prime Minister, Yishai was appointed Interior Minister and made a Deputy Prime Minister in Sharon&#x27;s national unity government. However, Shas were not included in Ariel Sharon&#x27;s coalition government formed after the 2003 elections.

Following the 2006 elections, Shas were invited to join Ehud Olmert&#x27;s coalition, and Yishai was made Minister of Industry, Trade, and Labour, as well as Deputy Prime Minister. In the same year, he was subjected to criticism after he claimed that negative results from the 2006 Lebanon War were a consequence of soldiers not being as religiously observant as they were in the past. Yishai remained Deputy Prime Minister following the 2009 elections, and returned to the Internal Affairs portfolio.

In May 2009, he refused to allow the Holy See to exercise jurisdiction over Christian holy sites in Israel, an agreement which would have resolved disputes over the implementation of the 1993 Fundamental Accord. That November, Yishai argued that African refugee migrants to Israel should not be allowed to settle permanently in Israel because they bring in &quot;a range of diseases such as hepatitis, measles, tuberculosis and AIDS.&quot; However, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reviewed Ministry of Health data, and concluded that there was a relatively low infection rate among asylum-seekers.

In a June 2012 interview with the Israeli daily &quot;Maariv&quot;, Yishai said: &quot;Muslims that arrive here do not even believe that this country belongs to us, to the white man.&quot;

In November 2012, during Operation Pillar of Defense, he was quoted by &quot;Haaretz&quot; as saying: &quot;The goal of the operation is to send Gaza back to the Middle Ages, only then will Israel be calm for the next 40 years.&quot;

In May 2013, some months after the internal rift following Deri&#x27;s political comeback, Yishai was ousted as party leader, being replaced by Deri. Ovadia Yosef, the Sephardi sage and Shas spiritual leader, said regarding his decision to oust Yishai: &quot;It was a deposit that he held, and now he can redeem it.&quot; Yosef also said he had told Deri at the time of his imprisonment that the position of party leader would be returned to him.

===Yachad===
In December 2014, Yishai announced that he would be leaving Shas to establish a new religious party, which would run in the 2015 elections. The announcement came after the friction between Deri and Yishai reached breaking point; Nine of Shas&#x27; eleven government ministers signed a statement indicating their support for Deri, and Shas&#x27; Council of Torah Sages ordered Deri to cancel a weekend meeting with Yishai during which the two planned to attempt a reconciliation.

The new party was named Yachad, and contested the 2015 elections in alliance with the far-right Otzma Yehudit party. However, it received only 2.97% of the vote, failing to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold, and did not win any seats.

<text>Dimitris Tsovolas (; 4 September 1942 – 25 February 2022) was a Greek politician who served as Minister of Finance from 1985 to 1989.

==Early life and education==
Tsovolas was born at Melissourgoi, a village outside Arta, Epirus in 1942. He went on to study law at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He worked as a lawyer in Arta.

==Political career==
Tsovolas later began his career in politics as a member of PASOK. He was first elected member of the Parliament representing Arta in 1977. He was reelected in 1981 and 1985. He was then elected as an MP for northern Athens.

Tsovolas served in the Ministry of Finance in Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s government from 1981 to 1989, serving as a deputy minister from 1981 to 1985, and as the full Minister of Finance from 1985 to 1989.

As the Koskotas scandal was unraveling, Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s blatant patronage reached the point of giving in one of his rallies a public command to Tsovolas, who was Minister of Finance, to &quot;give it all [to them]&quot; () and &quot;Tsovolas, empty the coffers [of the state],&quot; and the crowd chanted these back. Papandreou later on said that he was only joking, but this moment characterized the era and made Tsovala&#x27;s name infamous.

In 1989 he was tried for the so-called Koskotas scandal and was sentenced to 2 years in prison and 3 years lack of his political rights.

In October 1995 he left PASOK and on 20 December that year he founded the Democratic Social Movement.

==Personal life and death==
Tsovolas was married and had two children. He died on 25 February 2022, at the age of 79.

<text>Alexandra &quot;Aleka&quot; Papariga (née Drosou; ; born 5 November 1945) is a Greek retired politician who served the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) as its General Secretary from 1991 to 2013. She is the first woman to be General Secretary of KKE, and thus the first woman to head a major political party in Greece.

== Early years ==
Papariga was born in Athens in 1945. Her parents, Nikos Drosos and Kiki Drosou were National Resistance fighters and members of Communist Party of Greece (KKE), of Cephalonian origin.

She graduated from the Historical-Archeological Section of the Philosophy Faculty of Athens University and after graduation worked as an employee for eight years in various accounting offices. At the same time, she worked as a private tutor. Since 1976 she has worked exclusively in party and social activities.

== Political career ==
Papariga started out as an activist in the peace movement in 1961 and soon after joined the pupils&#x27; organization of the youth section of the United Democratic Left (EDA). She was active in various school and student movements until the military coup in 1967. Throughout this period, she was a member of the Bureau of the EDA youth section pupils&#x27; organization and then of the &quot;Lambrakis&quot; Democratic Youth Students’ organization Bureau.

=== Military junta===
She joined KKE in 1968, while it was illegal during the Greek junta and was active in the prisoners&#x27; families&#x27; movement.

=== Third Hellenic Republic ===
After the restoration of democracy, she became a member of the Bureau of the City Committee of the Athens Party Organization (KOA), and was also active in the women&#x27;s movement. A founding member of the Women&#x27;s Federation of Greece, she participated in the organization of national events for International Women&#x27;s Day. She was a leading member of the women&#x27;s movement until 1981, and then active in the Athens Party Organization up to 1991. During her activities in the women&#x27;s movement, she participated in international congresses of the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation, the United Nations, and many international conferences and symposia.

Papariga has been a member of the Central Committee of KKE since the 10th Congress (May 1978) and of the Politburo of the CC since 1986. On 27 February 1991 at the 13th Party Congress, she was elected as Secretary-General of the KKE. She was unanimously re-elected as Secretary-General on 26 May 1996, at the 15th Party Congress. In February 2009, Papariga was re-elected as Secretary-General at the 18th Party Congress. This re-election made her the longest serving General Secretary of the KKE.

As a KKE candidate in Athens B constituency, Papariga was elected to the Hellenic Parliament in 1993 election. On 12 January 2023, it was announced that she would not be a parliamentary candidate and that she would retire from politics after the 2023 election.

== Personal life ==
She married the journalist Thanasis Paparigas, with whom she had a daughter, Vasileia, and another child who died at the age of three. Her husband died on 11 October 2002, after being seriously injured in a car accident.

<doc id="584834" wikidata="Q1145668" url="?curid=584834" title="Hemolytic anemia">
<text>Hemolytic anemia or haemolytic anaemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). This most commonly occurs within the spleen, but also can occur in the reticuloendothelial system or mechanically (prosthetic valve damage). Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias. It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects. The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic. Treatment depends on the type and cause of the hemolytic anemia.

Symptoms of hemolytic anemia are similar to other forms of anemia (fatigue and shortness of breath), but in addition, the breakdown of red cells leads to jaundice and increases the risk of particular long-term complications, such as gallstones and pulmonary hypertension.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of hemolytic anemia are similar to the general signs of anemia. General signs and symptoms include fatigue, pallor, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. In small children, failure to thrive may occur in any form of anemia. In addition, symptoms related to hemolysis may be present such as chills, jaundice, dark urine, and an enlarged spleen. Certain aspects of the medical history can suggest a cause for hemolysis, such as drugs, medication side effects, autoimmune disorders, blood transfusion reactions, the presence of prosthetic heart valve, or other medical illness.

Chronic hemolysis leads to an increased excretion of bilirubin into the biliary tract, which in turn may lead to gallstones. The continuous release of free hemoglobin has been linked with the development of pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure over the pulmonary artery); this, in turn, leads to episodes of syncope (fainting), chest pain, and progressive breathlessness. Pulmonary hypertension eventually causes right ventricular heart failure, the symptoms of which are peripheral edema (fluid accumulation in the skin of the legs) and ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity).

==Causes==
They may be classified according to the means of hemolysis, being either intrinsic in cases where the cause is related to the red blood cell (RBC) itself, or extrinsic in cases where factors external to the RBC dominate. Intrinsic effects may include problems with RBC proteins or oxidative stress handling, whereas external factors include immune attack and microvascular angiopathies (RBCs are mechanically damaged in circulation).

=== Intrinsic causes ===
Hereditary (inherited) hemolytic anemia can be due to :
* Defects of red blood cell membrane production (as in hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis).
* Defects in hemoglobin production (as in thalassemia, sickle-cell disease and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia).
* Defective red cell metabolism (as in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency).
* Wilson&#x27;s disease may infrequently present with hemolytic anemia without due to excessive inorganic copper in blood circulation, which destroys red blood cells (though the mechanism of hemolysis is still unclear).

===Extrinsic causes===
Acquired hemolytic anemia may be caused by immune-mediated causes, drugs, and other miscellaneous causes.
* Immune-mediated causes could include transient factors as in &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; infection (cold agglutinin disease) or permanent factors as in autoimmune diseases like autoimmune hemolytic anemia (itself more common in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia).
* Spur cell hemolytic anemia
* Any of the causes of hypersplenism (increased activity of the spleen), such as portal hypertension.
* Acquired hemolytic anemia is also encountered in burns and as a result of certain infections (e.g. malaria).
* Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), sometimes referred to as Marchiafava-Micheli syndrome, is a rare, acquired, potentially life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by complement-induced intravascular hemolytic anemia.
* Lead poisoning resulting from the environment causes non-immune hemolytic anemia.
* Similarly, poisoning by arsine or stibine also causes hemolytic anemia.
* Runners can develop hemolytic anemia due to &quot;footstrike hemolysis&quot;, owing to the destruction of red blood cells in feet at foot impact.
* Low-grade hemolytic anemia occurs in 70% of prosthetic heart valve recipients, and severe hemolytic anemia occurs in 3%.

=== Combination ===
Sometimes hemolytic anemia can be caused by a combination of two causes, neither sufficient on its own.
* G6PD deficiency by itself is usually asymptomatic, but when combined with external stress such as an infection, fava beans, or oxidative drugs like primaquine it can become symptomatic.
* Primaquine and tafenoquine can pass through the placenta, causing hemolytic anemia &quot;in utero&quot; if the fetus has G6PD deficiency.
Among American ethnicities, G6PD is most prevalent among African Americans, with a prevalence of about 12.2% (males) and 4.1% (females). During the Korean War, many black soldiers developed acute hemolytic anemia after primaquine for treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, which led to early understanding of this kind of anemia.

==Mechanism==
In hemolytic anemia, there are two principal mechanisms of hemolysis; intravascular and extravascular.

=== Intravascular hemolysis ===
Intravascular hemolysis describes hemolysis that happens mainly inside the vasculature. As a result, the contents of the red blood cell are released into the general circulation, leading to hemoglobinemia and increasing the risk of ensuing hyperbilirubinemia.

Intravascular hemolysis may occur when red blood cells are targeted by autoantibodies, leading to complement fixation, or by damage by parasites such as Babesia.

=== Extravascular hemolysis ===
Extravascular hemolysis refers to hemolysis taking place in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In this case little hemoglobin escapes into blood plasma. The macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in these organs engulf and destroy structurally-defective red blood cells, or those with antibodies attached, and release unconjugated bilirubin into the blood plasma circulation. Typically, the spleen destroys mildly abnormal red blood cells or those coated with IgG-type antibodies, while severely abnormal red blood cells or those coated with IgM-type antibodies are destroyed in the circulation or in the liver.

If extravascular hemolysis is extensive, hemosiderin can be deposited in the spleen, bone marrow, kidney, liver, and other organs, resulting in hemosiderosis.

In a healthy person, a red blood cell survives 90 to 120 days in the circulation, so about 1% of human red blood cells break down each day. The spleen (part of the reticulo-endothelial system) is the main organ that removes old and damaged RBCs from the circulation. In healthy individuals, the breakdown and removal of RBCs from the circulation is matched by the production of new RBCs in the bone marrow.

In conditions where the rate of RBC breakdown is increased, the body initially compensates by producing more RBCs; however, breakdown of RBCs can exceed the rate that the body can make RBCs, and so anemia can develop. Bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin, can accumulate in the blood, causing jaundice.

In general, hemolytic anemia occurs as a modification of the RBC life cycle. That is, instead of being collected at the end of its useful life and disposed of normally, the RBC disintegrates in a manner allowing free iron-containing molecules to reach the blood. With their complete lack of mitochondria, RBCs rely on pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for the materials needed to reduce oxidative damage. Any limitations of PPP can result in more susceptibility to oxidative damage and a short or abnormal lifecycle. If the cell is unable to signal to the reticuloendothelial phagocytes by externalizing phosphatidylserine, it is likely to lyse through uncontrolled means.

The distinguishing feature of intravascular hemolysis is the release of RBC contents into the blood stream. The metabolism and elimination of these products, largely iron-containing compounds capable of doing damage through Fenton reactions, is an important part of the condition. Several reference texts exist on the elimination pathways, for example.
Free hemoglobin can bind to haptoglobin, and the complex is cleared from the circulation; thus, a decrease in haptoglobin can support a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. Alternatively, hemoglobin may oxidize and release the heme group that is able to bind to either albumin or hemopexin. The heme is ultimately converted to bilirubin and removed in stool and urine. Hemoglobin may be cleared directly by the kidneys resulting in fast clearance of free hemoglobin but causing the continued loss of hemosiderin loaded renal tubular cells for many days.

Additional effects of free hemoglobin seem to be due to specific reactions with NO.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia can be suspected on the basis of a constellation of symptoms and is largely based on the presence of anemia, an increased proportion of immature red cells (reticulocytes) and a decrease in the level of haptoglobin, a protein that binds free hemoglobin. Examination of a peripheral blood smear and some other laboratory studies can contribute to the diagnosis. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include those that can occur in all anemias as well as the specific consequences of hemolysis. All anemias can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased ability to exercise when severe. Symptoms specifically related to hemolysis include jaundice and dark colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin (hemoglobinuria). When restricted to the morning hemoglobinuria may suggest paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. Direct examination of blood under a microscope in a peripheral blood smear may demonstrate red blood cell fragments called schistocytes, red blood cells that look like spheres (spherocytes), and/or red blood cells missing small pieces (bite cells). An increased number of newly made red blood cells (reticulocytes) may also be a sign of bone marrow compensation for anemia. Laboratory studies commonly used to investigate hemolytic anemia include blood tests for breakdown products of red blood cells, bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, a test for the free hemoglobin binding protein haptoglobin, and the direct Coombs test (also called direct antiglobulin test or DAT) to evaluate complement factors and/or antibodies binding to red blood cells:
==Treatment==

Definitive therapy depends on the cause:
* Symptomatic treatment can be given by blood transfusion, if there is marked anemia. A positive Coombs test is a relative contraindication to transfuse the patient. In cold hemolytic anemia there is advantage in transfusing warmed blood.
* In severe immune-related hemolytic anemia, steroid therapy is sometimes necessary.
* In steroid resistant cases, consideration can be given to rituximab or addition of an immunosuppressant (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide).
* Association of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin can control hemolysis in acute severe cases.
* Sometimes splenectomy can be helpful where extravascular hemolysis, or hereditary spherocytosis, is predominant (i.e., most of the red blood cells are being removed by the spleen).

Mitapivat was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2022.

==Other animals==
Hemolytic anemia affects nonhuman species as well as humans. It has been found, in a number of animal species, to result from specific triggers.

Some notable cases include hemolytic anemia found in black rhinos kept in captivity, with the disease, in one instance, affecting 20% of captive rhinos at a specific facility. The disease is also found in wild rhinos.

Dogs and cats differ slightly from humans in some details of their RBC composition and have altered susceptibility to damage, notably, increased susceptibility to oxidative damage from consumption of onion. Garlic is less toxic to dogs than onion.

<text>Rabbi Binyamin &quot;Benny&quot; Elon (, 10 November 1954 – 5 May 2017) was an Israeli Orthodox rabbi and politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Moledet and the National Union between 1996 and 2009. A ninth-generation Jerusalemite, Elon lived in Beit El, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, for over twenty years, and was married to author and journalist Emuna Elon. They had six children. His father, Menachem Elon, was the former Deputy Chief Justice of Israel. His brother, disgraced Rabbi Mordechai Elon, has been a prominent controversial figure in the Religious Zionist Movement.

==Biography==
Born in Jerusalem, Elon studied at Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva, and Kollel HaIdra in the Golan Heights, before being ordained as a rabbi in 1978. Together with Hanan Porat, he founded the Beit Orot Talmudic College, and Elon became its first dean.

He was first elected to the Knesset in 1996 as a member of the right-wing Moledet Party, advocating &quot;voluntary&quot; transfer of the Palestinian population from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, an ideology shared by Elon. In 1998, he led a group of religious students in taking over a compound in Sheikh Jarrah, which spurred the government to start subsidizing illegal settlements there. In 1999, he again tried to take over a compound in Sheikh Jarrah. His efforts were unsuccessful and a court ruled in favor of the Abu Jibna family who owned it.

In 1999, the party allied with other right-wing parties to form the National Union party. Following the assassination of Moledet leader Rehavam Ze&#x27;evi in 2001, Elon was elected to replace him as party chairman and as Tourism Minister. He consequently served two terms as Minister of Tourism, between 2001 and 2002, and again between 2003 and 2004, both in Ariel Sharon&#x27;s government. During his second spell in the cabinet, Elon attempted to foil Ariel Sharon&#x27;s plan to dismiss him from the cabinet for intending to vote against the disengagement plan by going into hiding, claiming if he did not receive his dismissal in person within 48 hours of the cabinet meeting, then he would still be able to vote. Ultimately, his dismissal was deemed legal, and he was not allowed to vote in the meeting. He was re-elected in 2006, but did not run in the 2009 elections due to health issues.

== Ideology ==
Elon was a keen supporter of the continuation of the Israeli settlement enterprise in the West Bank and wanted to rebuild the Gaza settlements. He did not recognize a Palestinian right for self-determination in any part of Eretz Israel (&quot;Land of Israel&quot;), the area which he stated God gave to the Jews according to the Hebrew Bible. As such, he rejected mainstream efforts for establishing peace in the Middle East (see Road map for peace). Instead, he suggested an alternative proposal called &quot;The Right Road to Peace&quot;, also known as the Elon Peace Plan. The plan would have Israel annex Gaza and the West Bank Jordan a &quot;voluntary&quot; transfer of the Palestinian population to neighboring countries would occur, primarily with Jordan as the destination. Those who refused would become stateless.

==Additional work==
He was the author of &quot;God&#x27;s Covenant with Israel: Establishing Biblical Boundaries in Today&#x27;s World&quot; (2005).

As Minister of Tourism, Benny Elon reached out to the Christian world when Jewish–Christian relations were still very strained. He served as the Chairman of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus in the Israeli Parliament, growing its influence and connections. Benny traveled extensively, meeting with Members of Parliament, Pastors, faith leaders, and House Representatives and Senators. In 2006, the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus was established in the U.S. House of Representatives which has been chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, former Rep. Dave Weldon, Rep. Eliot Engel, Rep. Trent Franks, and others. The work of the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus and the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus led to the establishment of 34 additional caucuses in nations worldwide, and in 2007, Rabbi Elon founded the Israel Allies Foundation to resource, educate, and encourage the pro-Israel initiatives of this international parliamentary network.

Elon maintained close contacts with Christians worldwide, including radio personality Janet Parshall, former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, the Christian Coalition of America, Pat Robertson, Hungarian Pastor Sandor Nemeth, and others.
==Death==
In February 2006 Elon was diagnosed with throat cancer. He was treated, but it was never cured, and he retired in 2008 due to related health problems. After eleven years, he died from the condition on May 5, 2017.

<doc id="584841" wikidata="Q7243222" url="?curid=584841" title="PrimeStar">
<text>PrimeStar was an American direct broadcast satellite broadcasting company formed in November 1990 by seven cable television companies including Comcast Corp. and TCI Communications Corp. PrimeStar was the first medium-powered DBS system in the United States but slowly declined in popularity with the arrival of DirecTV in 1994 and Dish Network in 1996.

== Technology ==
PrimeStar was a medium-powered DBS-style system utilizing FSS technology that used a larger 3-foot (91 cm) satellite dish to receive signals.

Broadcast originally in analog, they later converted to digital technology. The system used the DigiCipher 1 system for conditional access control and video compression. The video format was MPEG-2. Primestar&#x27;s satellite receivers were made by General Instrument.

PrimeStar was owned by a consortium of cable television companies who leased equipment to subscribers through the local cable company.

The company was in the process of converting to a high-powered DBS platform when it was purchased and shut down by DirecTV. The Tempo-1 and Tempo-2 DBS satellites acquired by PrimeStar from the defunct ASkyB were renamed DirecTV-5 and DirecTV-6, respectively.

== History ==
The system initially launched using medium-powered FSS satellites that were facing obsolescence with the onset of high-powered DBS and its much smaller, eighteen-inch satellite dishes. In a move to convert the platform to DBS, PrimeStar, originally based in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania before moving to the suburbs of Denver, Colorado in 1997, bid for the 110-degree satellite location that was eventually awarded to a never-launched direct broadcast satellite service by MCI and News Corporation called ASkyB, or &quot;American Sky Broadcasting&quot;, named after News Corp&#x27;s British Sky Broadcasting, also named as a combination of the merged companies &quot;British&quot; Satellite &quot;Broadcasting&quot; and &quot;Sky&quot; Television.

The ASkyB company sold the incomplete Tempo 1 and Tempo 2 DBS satellites to PrimeStar in the process of going out of business. PrimeStar launched Tempo-2 in 1997 but it was not used for many years. PrimeStar stored the other satellite, Tempo-1, until the company and the two satellites were purchased by DirecTV. DirecTV eventually launched the Tempo 1 satellite after years of delays as the DirecTV-5 satellite in 2002. Meanwhile, ASkyB&#x27;s license for the 110-degree satellite location, and an uplink center, was resold to EchoStar, the parent company of Dish Network. The 110-degree satellite is now named EchoStar West 110 and is the most commonly used satellite, along with 119 as both can be received with a single wide-format parabolic dish, providing signal to North America.

PrimeStar Partners sold its assets to DirecTV in 1999 and after briefly being known as &quot;PrimeStar by DirecTV&quot; all subscribers were converted to the DirecTV platform in 2000. The PrimeStar brand and its FSS broadcast platform was shut down. Meanwhile, Tempo 1 and Tempo 2 satellite remained and were renamed DirecTV-5 and DirecTV-6, respectively, and moved to several locations to serve DirecTV customers.

==Features==
During Primestar&#x27;s years as a competing satellite television provider, it originally had a 95-channel lineup. However, beginning on April 20, 1997, Primestar announced it would add 65 channels, for a total of 160 channels. However, due to a lack of capacity on the FSS platform, many channels only aired for part of the day or week (e.g., MuchMusic USA aired weekdays from 2:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET, and weekends from 12:00 to 5:00 p.m. ET). Primestar, also at this time in 1997, grouped their channels by category, (e.g., &quot;NEWS&quot;, &quot;FAMILY&quot;, &quot;SPORTS&quot;, &quot;MOVIES&quot;, etc.), and added a color-coded button on the remote for each category. When pressed, it would bring the user to the beginning of that category, (e.g., pressing the orange &quot;FAMILY&quot; button would bring the user to Nickelodeon which was first in that category). Primestar called this feature &quot;Hyper-Surfing&quot;. (Earlier remotes that lacked the buttons could instead use repetitive channel numbers to bring them to the desired category.)

== New uses for old equipment ==
Old PrimeStar satellite dishes are popular among hobbyists for free-to-air (FTA) satellite broadcasts on the Ku band transponders of FSS satellites.

The dishes are also popular for wireless computer networking as high-gain Wi-Fi antennas. The antennas are also used by amateur (ham) radio operators to transmit two-way amateur television.

<doc id="584842" wikidata="Q13066" url="?curid=584842" title="Bellatrix">
<text>Bellatrix is the third-brightest star and a candidate binary star in the constellation of Orion, positioned 5° west of the red supergiant Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis). It has the Bayer designation γ Orionis, which is Latinized to Gamma Orionis. With a slightly variable magnitude of around 1.6, it is typically the 25th-brightest star in the night sky. According to parallax measurememts by the Hipparcos spacecraft, Bellatrix is located at a distance of 250 light-years.

== Nomenclature ==

The traditional name &quot;Bellatrix&quot; is from the Latin &quot;bellātrix&quot; &quot;female warrior&quot;. It first appeared in the works of Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi and Johannes Hispalensis, where it originally referred to Capella, but was transferred to Gamma Orionis by the Vienna school of astronomers in the 15th century, and appeared in contemporary reprints of the &quot;Alfonsine tables&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Bellatrix&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The designation of Bellatrix as γ Orionis (Latinized to Gamma Orionis) was made by Johann Bayer in 1603. The &quot;gamma&quot; designation is commonly given to the third-brightest star in each constellation.

==Standard star==
Bellatrix has been used as both a photometric and spectral standard star, but both characteristics have been shown to be unreliable.

In 1963, Bellatrix was included with a set of bright stars used to define the UBV magnitude system. These are used for comparison with other stars to check for variability, and so by definition, the apparent magnitude of Bellatrix was set to 1.64. However, when an all-sky photometry survey was carried out in 1988, this star was suspected to be variable. It was measured ranging in apparent magnitude from 1.59 to 1.64, and appears to be a low amplitude, possibly irregular variable.

==Physical properties==

The spectral types for O and early B stars were defined more rigorously in 1971 and Bellatrix was used as a standard for the B2 III type. The expected brightness of Bellatrix from this spectral type is about one magnitude brighter than calculated from its apparent magnitude and Hipparcos distance. Analysis of the observed characteristics of the star indicate that it should be a B2 main sequence star, not the giant that it appears from its spectral type. Close analysis of high resolution spectra suggest that it is a spectroscopic binary composed of two similar stars less luminous than a B2 giant. 

Bellatrix is a massive star with about 8.6 times the mass and 6.4 times the radius of the Sun. As a massive star, this star will evolve faster than the Sun, currently it has an estimated age of approximately 25 million years. The hydrogen should be exhausted in seven million years, after that Bellatrix will expand and cool. It may end its life in a supernova. The effective temperature of the outer envelope of this star is , which is considerably hotter than the 5,772 K on the Sun. This high temperature gives this star the blue-white hue that occurs with B-type stars. It shows a projected rotational velocity of around 52 km/s.

==Companions==
Bellatrix was thought to belong to the Orion OB1 association of stars that share a common motion through space, along with the stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt: Alnitak (Zeta Orionis), Alnilam (Epsilon Orionis), and Mintaka (Delta Orionis). However, this is no longer believed to be the case, as Bellatrix is now known to be much closer than the rest of the group. It is not known to have a stellar companion, although researchers Maria-Fernanda Nieva and Norbert Przybilla raised the possibility it might be a spectroscopic binary. A 2011 search for nearby companions failed to conclusively find any objects that share a proper motion with Bellatrix. Three nearby candidates were all found to be background stars.

Some researchers suspected that Bellatrix was a member of the 32 Orionis group. They proposed that the 32 Ori group should instead be termed the Bellatrix Cluster on the basis that the sky position and distance of Bellatrix are similar to those of the 32 Ori group. The proper motion of Bellatrix deviates significantly from the mean motion of the group, leaving its membership in question. However, it may be possible to reconcile membership if the divergent velocity is the result of an unseen companion. For example, a face-on orbit with a black hole companion orbiting from the star with a period measured in centuries could account for the discrepancy.

==Etymology and cultural significance==
Bellatrix was also called the Amazon Star, which Richard Hinckley Allen proposed came from a loose translation of the Arabic name &quot;Al Najīd&quot;, the Conqueror. A c.1275 Arabic celestial globe records the name as المرزم &quot;the lion&quot;. Bellatrix is one of the four navigational stars in Orion that are used for celestial navigation.

In the 17th century catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium&quot; of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated &quot;Menkib al Jauza al Aisr&quot;, which was translated into Latin as &quot;Humerus Sinister Gigantis&quot; (The Left Shoulder of the Giant).

The Wardaman people of northern Australia know Bellatrix as &quot;Banjan&quot;, the sparkling pigment used in ceremonies conducted by Rigel the Red Kangaroo Leader in a songline when Orion is high in the sky. The other stars of Orion are his ceremonial tools and entourage. Betelgeuse is &quot;Ya-jungin&quot; &quot;Owl Eyes Flicking&quot;, watching the ceremonies.

To the Inuit, the appearance of Betelgeuse and Bellatrix high in the southern sky after sunset marked the beginning of spring and lengthening days in late February and early March. The two stars were known as &quot;Akuttujuuk&quot; &quot;those (two) placed far apart&quot;, referring to the distance between them, mainly to people from North Baffin Island and Melville Peninsula.

<text>Daniel Francis Haggerty (November 19, 1942 – January 15, 2016) was an American actor who was best known for playing the title role in the film and television series &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot;.

== Early life ==
Haggerty was born in Pound, Wisconsin. His parents separated when he was three. He ran away from military school several times. He lived with his father in Burbank, California.

== Acting career ==
Haggerty was cast in a small non-speaking role as a bodybuilder in the 1964 film &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot; and also as a bodybuilder in the 1965 romantic comedy musical &quot;Girl Happy&quot;. He also worked as a stuntman on the 1966 television series &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and as set builder on various other projects. More stunt work followed, as well as supporting roles in numerous low-budget biker and wildlife films of the era, such as &quot;Angels Die Hard&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Frontier Fremont&quot;, and &quot;Terror Out of the Sky&quot;. In addition to his bit part as a hippie in &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, he also assisted in building the motorcycles featured in the film.

 His experience with animals also brought him work as an animal trainer and handler in films produced by Walt Disney Studios. Haggerty directed white tigers, wolverines, eagles, and wild boar in the 1974 feature film &quot;When the North Wind Blows&quot; for Sunn Classic Pictures, which also produced &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot;, a wildly popular film released the same year, in which he portrayed the title character Grizzly Adams. From the latter film evolved the NBC television series of the same name which ran from 1977 to 1978, and Haggerty became known to movie-goers for his portrayal of nature-loving James Capen &quot;Grizzly&quot; Adams.

Haggerty starred in the television film &quot;Condominium&quot; (1980), which also starred Barbara Eden, Ralph Bellamy and Stuart Whitman. Haggerty played a hydrology expert trying to warn residents that their Florida condos were about to be demolished in an approaching hurricane. In 1981, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, called &quot;Waikiki Angels,&quot; as Bo Thompson. He guest-starred as &quot;Sawdust Radell&quot; on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in 1983 (&quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Kisser&quot;). That year, he also appeared briefly in David Carradine&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Americana&quot; and provided a fighting dog for the production. In the film, he not only played the role of the dog&#x27;s trainer, but also assisted in set design and the restoration of a broken down carousel, which figured prominently in the film.

Haggerty made a cameo appearance as an attorney in &quot;Terror Night&quot; (1987) with John Ireland and Cameron Mitchell, starred in &quot;Night Wars&quot; (1988) as a Vietnam veteran who is a psychologist dealing with nightmares of his fellow veterans, and appeared in horror films such as &quot;Elves&quot; and the Linda Blair film &quot;The Chilling&quot; in 1989. He starred in the 1989 film &quot;Spirit of the Eagle&quot;.

Haggerty played lead roles in the films &quot;Repo Jake&quot; (1990) and &quot;Elves&quot; (1989). In 1995&#x27;s &quot;Grizzly Mountain&quot;, he starred as a modern-day version of Grizzly Adams and worked with bears, foxes, and hawks in the film. He reprised his role in &quot;Escape to Grizzly Mountain&quot; (2000). Haggerty was featured as a character in Al Franken&#x27;s 1999 political satire novel, &quot;Why Not Me?&quot;.

Haggerty continued to work as both an actor and infomercial spokesman. One of his endorsements was for the Pap-Ion Magnetic Inductor (PAP-IMI), a device alleged to have health benefits. He had only been hired as a spokesperson and was found not to be part of the fraud that later embroiled the manufacturer.

In &quot;Big Stan&quot; (2007), he played Tubby, and appeared as a lumberjack foreman in &quot;Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan&quot; (2013). Haggerty also performed several voice-overs and can also be seen in music videos by Hank Williams Jr. and Rogues of the Empire. Haggerty appeared on the U.S. television show &quot;American Pickers&quot; in its episode &quot;California Kustom&quot;, which aired on History on February 25, 2013.

==Personal life==
Haggerty married Diane Rooker in 1959 at a Las Vegas wedding chapel in the Silver Slipper Hotel when they were 17. The couple had two daughters, Tracey and Tammy. They divorced in 1984, after which Haggerty married Samantha Hilton. Haggerty and Hilton had two sons, Dylan and Cody, and one daughter, Megan. They were married until Hilton&#x27;s death following a motorcycle accident on August 10, 2008.

Haggerty lived on a small ranch in Malibu Canyon with an assortment of wild animals that he had tamed at birth or rescued from injury. At a restaurant in 1977, a patron with a flaming cocktail set Haggerty&#x27;s beard on fire. As he attempted to extinguish the flames, Haggerty received third-degree burns on his arms. Production on &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot; television series was halted while Haggerty recovered. In 1991, Haggerty was hospitalized after a motorcycle accident left him in a coma.

In 1985, Haggerty received a jail sentence of 90 days and three years&#x27; probation after being convicted of selling cocaine to an undercover police officer.

===Death===
In August 2015, Haggerty was diagnosed with spinal cancer after a tumor was discovered while he underwent back surgery. He died of spinal cancer on January 15, 2016, in Burbank, California.

<text>The Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area is a national, bi-state area on the Ohio River near Louisville, Kentucky, in the United States, administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Federal status was awarded in 1981. The falls were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1966.

==Overview==
The area is located at the Falls of the Ohio, which was the only navigational barrier on the river in earlier times. The falls were a series of rapids formed by the relatively recent erosion of the Ohio River operating on 386-million-year-old Devonian hard limestone rock shelves. Louisville, Kentucky, and the associated Indiana communities—Jeffersonville, Clarksville, and New Albany—all owe their existence as communities to the falls, as the navigational obstacles the falls presented meant that late-18th-century and early- to late-19th-century river traffic could benefit from local expertise in navigating the drop made by the river over a distance of two miles (3 km). In its original form, the falls could be characterized more as rapids extending over a length of the river, than as a point-like discontinuity in a river such as Niagara Falls. Still, the falls provided a singular, dramatic, and daunting obstacle to navigation on this important inland waterway.

The first locks on the river, the Louisville and Portland Canal completed in 1830, were built within a bypass canal constructed to provide year-round navigation of the river. The falls were later largely covered by the McAlpine Locks and Dam, built by the Army Corps of Engineers. The taming of the Ohio River at the falls, with the attendant reduction in local flow velocity, has of late led to the covering over of the fossil beds by large and increasing quantities of low-velocity effluvia: although an impediment to viewing the fossils, this action serves to protect the portions of the falls covered over by sediment and therefore temporarily immune to direct weathering. However, a significant area of the fossil-rich Devonian limestone rock is still left exposed, and is accessible to visitors today. The best time for visitation is during the low water season of the Ohio River between August and October. Removal of fossils is prohibited.
The shallowness of the falls provided a favored crossing point for bison in pre-settlement times and, later, an easy crossing for Native Americans.

In 1990, a section of the area in Indiana became the Falls of the Ohio State Park. An interpretive center is open throughout the year.

==Size and sound==
Prior to modification for industrial and navigational purposes, the Falls of the Ohio spanned the entire width of the Ohio River. Native Americans and early European explorers heard the crisp roar of the Ohio River crashing down the cascade falls more than 10 miles away.

==Geology==

The rock unit in which the falls are formed is referred to as the Jeffersonville limestone. The limestone formed approximately 387 to 380 million years ago during the Emsian Age (in the latest part of the Early Devonian Period) and the Eifelian Age (Middle Devonian). The exposure is unique—large and diverse tabulate corals and rugose corals are exposed in lifelike positions. Brachiopods and bryozoans are also present, as are gastropods (snails).

During the Devonian Period, the region lay at the bottom of a shallow inland sea about ten degrees north of the equator in the supercontinent of Euramerica.

<doc id="584849" wikidata="Q1684962" url="?curid=584849" title="Jean-Louis Costes">
<text>Jean-Louis Costes (born 13 May 1954) is a French noise musician, performance artist and film actor. Costes has been described as the French version of GG Allin, though unlike Allin&#x27;s rudimentary brand of hardcore punk, Costes&#x27; music is largely synth-driven, relying heavily on looped beats, overmodulated vocals, and random outbursts of screaming and glitch fills.

==Career==
He was once married to Lisa Crystal Carver with whom he performed in Suckdog. He helped write the backing music for the &quot;noise opera&quot; music of the Suckdog Circus. His albums include &quot;Hung by the Dick&quot; from Nihilist Records.

===Shows===
In 2003, he performed a so-called &quot;porno-social opera&quot; entitled the &quot;Holy Virgin Cult&quot; (&quot;Le Culte de la Vierge&quot;) across the United States with two other performers credited as &quot;Tristan&quot; and &quot;Nesi&quot;.

The performance was approximately 90 minutes long, with three distinct acts and shorter vignettes, and followed a prerecorded soundtrack. Each act began with the performers dressed in elaborate costumes; priests and a nun, a salesman, child and a housewife, ancient templegoers or gods, and ended with all three actors nude and performing simulated and semi-simulated social taboos, scaring audiences with a barrage of apparent flung feces, urine, blood, tortured screaming, public sex and religious symbolism. The performance was written by Costes, reportedly based on his childhood in France.

In 2007, Costes and Lisou Prout completed the &quot;Les Petits Oiseaux Chient&quot; () tour across the United States and Canada.

===Music===
Costes is considered as one of the first punk-DIY French artists, self-releasing dozens of tapes and CDs from the early 1980s to nowadays. His discography is surprisingly rich and outlandish, melding experimental, spoken word, electronics, sometimes hip-hop or metal, often parodying the French variety-song culture. It consists of more than seventy albums, some recorded in English, German or Japanese.

In 2015, a show played on a grand piano was released as his first live album, &quot;Le fantôme d&#x27;Archie Shepp&quot; (&quot;Archie Shepp&#x27;s ghost&quot;). In 2020 he worked with Kommissar Hjuler for the album &quot;Völlig Bescheuerte Musik&quot; (Psych.KG).

=== Writing ===
Costes also published a variety of books, including collections of short stories, novels, comic-strips or photo-novels.

His first novel, &quot;Viva la merda!&quot;, was published in 2003, by the underground editor Hermaphrodite. In 2006, &quot;Grand-père&quot;, a semi-fictional biography of his own grandfather (labeled as a &quot;fascist and anti-french racist immigrant&quot;, according to the title of the short story published in 2002, which was developed into this novel), was published by the major Fayard editor (which for instance published Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s fourth novel &quot;La possibilité d&#x27;une île&quot; the year before).

On 1 April 2006, he was a guest at the Saturday evening show &quot;Tout le monde en parle&quot; (his only appearance on mainstream television), where he read an excerpt of the book (for two minutes straight, in complete silence of the host and the other guests, which itself was an oddity with regards to the usual hectic routine of that show) ; the show&#x27;s host Thierry Ardisson expressed how much he was impressed by the writing style, which he likened to that of Louis-Ferdinand Céline.

His next novel, &quot;Un bunker en banlieue&quot; (&quot;A Bunker in the Suburbs&quot;), about a violent outburst from a middle-aged man called Jean-Louis, described as an &quot;eternal loser&quot; and waging his personal revenge against the whole world, was refused by Fayard, as well as 23 other publishers, before it was finally published in 2007 by the underground Eretic publishing house.

=== Filmography ===
He appeared in the controversial movies &quot;Baise-moi&quot; (2000), &quot;Irréversible&quot; (2002) and &quot;Life Pornography&quot; (2003). Following the shooting of &quot;Irréversible&quot;, he published a text entitled &quot;Irrécupérable&quot; (&quot;Irredeemable&quot;), recounting this experience and his disappointment about it, laughing at the fact that even Gaspar Noé, Vincent Cassel or Albert Dupontel (each known for their controversial works) were shocked by his behaviour and genuine underground credentials, or that they were willing to produce filthy movies but unwilling to get anywhere near actual filth or filthy people, labeling Noé as a &quot;stuffed rotten bourgeois controlled by the CNC created by Pétain&quot; and Cassel as a &quot;spoilt brat starlet&quot;.&quot;Yeah, ’cause my career in cinema, it&#x27;s the guy who gets cornholed (as in &quot;Baise-moi&quot; by Virginie Despentes) or the guy who masturbates his ass. Costes, the Mister Anal of french cinéma. Well, you see, it sounds lousy, but it&#x27;s gonna get me some job, since none of those Dupontel-Cassoulet wants to get butt-fucked in front of a camera, so I get the monopoly of &#x27;artistic&#x27; onscreen ass!&quot;

<text>Caodong school () is a Chinese Chan Buddhist branch and one of the Five Houses of Chán. 

The school emphasised sitting meditation (Ch: zuochan, Jp: zazen), and the &quot;five ranks&quot; teaching. During the Song dynasty, Caodong masters like Hongzhi Zhengjue developed &quot;silent illumination&quot; (mozhao) meditation.

==Etymology==
The key figure in the Caodong school was founder Dongshan Liangjie (807–869, 洞山良价, Jpn. Tozan Ryokai) and his heir Caoshan Benji (840–901, 曹山本寂, Ts&#x27;ao-shan Pen-chi, Jpn. Sōzan Honjaku). Some attribute the name &quot;Cáodòng&quot; as a union of &quot;Dongshan&quot; and &quot;Caoshan&quot;. The &quot;Cao&quot; may also be from &quot;Cáoxī&quot; (曹溪), the &quot;mountain-name&quot; of Huineng, the Sixth Ancestor of Chan, as Caoshan was of little importance unlike his contemporary and fellow Dharma-heir, Yunju Daoying. 

==History==
The Caodong school was founded by Dongshan Liangjie and his Dharma-heir Caoshan Benji. Dongshan traced back his lineage to Shitou Xiqian (700–790), a contemporary of Mazu Daoyi (709–788). Sayings to the effect that Shitou and Mazu were the two great masters of their day date from decades after their respective deaths. Shítóu&#x27;s retrospective prominence owes much to the importance of Dongshan Liangjie. Shítóu does not appear to have been influential or famous during his lifetime: 
In the 11th century the Caodong-school nearly extinguished. Dayang Jingxuan (942-1027), the last descendant of the Caodong-lineage passed on his dharma-transmission via Fushan Fayuan, a teacher from the Linji school, to Fayuan&#x27;s student Touzi Yiqing (1032-1083), who was born five years after Jingxuan&#x27;s death.

During the Northern Song (960–1127) the Caodong was not successful in the social elite. The Linji school and Yunmen school dominated Chán. It was Touzi Yiqing&#x27;s student Furong Daokai (1043–1118) who was a successful monastic, and revived the Caodong school.

His dharma &quot;grandson&quot; Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091–1157) became very successful among elite literati in the Southern Song (1127–1279), when the Imperial Court decreased their influence on society, and Chán schools became dependent on elite literati for support. Under Hongzhi and Zhengzie Qingliao, the Caodong school was revived and became one of the major traditions of Song dynasty Chan. 

These Song era teachers taught a practiced termed &quot;silent illumination&quot; or &quot;serene reflection&quot; (Ch: 默照禅) which relied on the doctrine of inherent enlightenment and buddha-nature. Since Buddha was seen as something already present in the mind, all that one needed to do was to let go of all striving and this was achieved by silently sitting in meditation. 

The success of the revived Caodong school drew opposition from Linji school figures like Dahui Zonggao, who promoted the Hua Tou method of koan practice, and attacked silent illumination as quietistic.

In 1227 Dōgen Zenji, a former Tendai student, studied Caodong Buddhism under Tiantong Rujing, and returned to Japan to establish the Sōtō sect. His lineage incorporates not only the dharma-transmission via Fushan Fayuan, but also Linji dharma-transmissions via Eisai and his student Myozen, a teacher of Dogen, and the Linji dharma-transmission of Dahui Zonggao via the Nōnin school.

==Influence==
===Korea===
Caodong school was introduced to Korea at the end of Silla, through Seon master Ieom (利嚴, 869–936). He arrived China in 894 and studied under teaching of Yunju Daoying. He returned to Silla in 911 and then established Sumi-san (須彌山) school to expand Caodong&#x27;s teaching. He had several hundred students, his sect is one of Nine mountain schools. Later, the Nine mountain schools had been unified to Jogye Order by Jinul and Taego Bou.

===Japan===
===Vietnam===
Caodong school is called &quot;Tào Động tông&quot; in Vietnamese. It was brought to the north Vietnam in the late of 17th century by Thiền master Thông Giác Thủy Nguyệt (通覺水月, 1637-1704), a disciple of Yiju Zhijiao (一句智教). Chan master Zhijiao is the 4th generation after Zhanran Yuancheng (湛然圓澄, 1561-1626) - one of Caodong school&#x27;s famous revivers in late Ming period.

==Lineage chart==
via Shitou the Caodong traces back its origins to Huineng.

<doc id="584854" wikidata="Q183098" url="?curid=584854" title="Budd–Chiari syndrome">
<text>Budd–Chiari syndrome is a condition when an occlusion or obstruction in the hepatic veins prevent normal outflow of blood from the liver. 

The symptoms are non-specific and vary widely, but it may present with the classical triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and liver enlargement. Untreated Budd-Chiari syndrome can result in liver failure.

It is usually seen in younger adults, with the median age at diagnosis between 35 and 40 years, and it has a similar incidence in males and females. It is a very rare condition, affecting one in a million adults. The syndrome can be fulminant, acute, chronic, or asymptomatic. Subacute presentation is the most common form. 

Patients with hypercoagulable disorders, polycythemia vera, and hepatocellular carcinoma are at a higher risk of having Budd-Chiari syndrome. 

==Signs and symptoms==
The acute syndrome presents with rapidly progressive and severe upper abdominal pain, yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, liver enlargement, spleen enlargement, fluid accumulation within the peritoneal cavity, elevated liver enzymes, and eventually encephalopathy. The fulminant syndrome presents early with encephalopathy and ascites. Liver cell death and severe lactic acidosis may be present as well. Caudate lobe enlargement is often present. The majority of patients have a slower-onset form of Budd–Chiari syndrome. This can be painless. A system of venous collaterals may form around the occlusion which may be seen on imaging as a &quot;spider&#x27;s web&quot;. Patients may progress to cirrhosis and show signs of liver failure.

==Causes==
The cause of Budd–Chiari syndrome can be found in more than 80% of patients with the condition. However, in 20% of cases, there is no underlying cause discovered. These cases are known as idiopathic Budd–Chiari syndrome. In about 75% of cases, there is an underlying hypercoagulability disorder, with a third of these people having two or more hypercoagulable disorders.

Primary Budd–Chiari syndrome occurs due to thrombosis of the hepatic vein. The most common cause is due to acquired hypercoagulability associated with myeloproliferative disorders (accounting for 40–50% of cases). Other acquired hypercoagulable disorders that may result in Budd–Chiari syndrome include antiphospholipid syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which are responsible for 10–12% and 7–12% of Budd–Chiari syndrome cases, respectively. Inherited disorders of hypercoagulability may lead to thrombosis of the hepatic vein and Budd–Chiari syndrome. Factor V Leiden is responsible for 8% of cases. Other less common inherited disorders leading to the condition include factor II mutation (3%), protein C deficiency (5%), protein S deficiency (4%), and antithrombin III deficiency(1%). Budd–Chiari syndrome may be the presenting sign of these hypercoagulable disorders.

Secondary Budd–Chiari syndrome, which is very rare compared to the primary variant, is due to compression of the hepatic vein by an outside structure (such as a tumor or polycystic kidney disease).

Budd–Chiari syndrome is also seen in tuberculosis, congenital venous webs and occasionally in inferior vena caval stenosis.

An important non-genetic risk factor is the use of estrogen-containing forms of hormonal contraception, which is implicated in 22% of cases of Budd–Chiari syndrome. Other less common risk factors include systemic diseases such as aspergillosis, Behçet&#x27;s disease, connective tissue disease, mastocytosis, inflammatory bowel disease, HIV infection, sarcoidosis or myeloma. Medications such as dacarbazine, pregnancy, trauma or recent abdominal surgery are other causes.

People who have paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) appear to be especially at risk for Budd–Chiari syndrome, more than other forms of thrombophilia: up to 39% develop venous thromboses, and 12% may acquire Budd–Chiari.

==Pathophysiology==

Any obstruction of the venous vasculature of the liver is referred to as Budd–Chiari syndrome, from the venules to the right atrium. This leads to increased portal vein and hepatic sinusoid pressures as the blood flow stagnates. The increased portal pressure causes increased filtration of vascular fluid with the formation of ascites in the abdomen and collateral venous flow through alternative veins leading to esophageal, gastric and rectal varices. Obstruction also causes centrilobular necrosis and peripheral lobule fatty change due to ischemia. If this condition persists chronically what is known as nutmeg liver will develop. Kidney failure may occur, perhaps due to the body sensing an &quot;underfill&quot; state and subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin pathways and excess sodium retention.

==Diagnosis==
Budd Chiari syndrome may present with elevated liver enzymes; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are often elevated in the acute phase and then decrease over time as chronic liver disease develops. Liver dysfunction can be indirectly measured with labs such as an elevated INR, decreased albumin level, and an elevated bilirubin level.

==Treatment==
Identifying and treating the secondary cause of the hypercoagulability, or the primary hypercoagulable disorder leading to the Budd–Chiari syndrome is essential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garcia-Pagan NEJM 4/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to secondary causes of hypercoagulability, 40–50% of cases of Budd–Chiari syndrome are due to myeloproliferative disorders, and these conditions each have their own specific treatments. A beta-blocker is indicated for prophylaxis against esophageal variceal bleeding and as needed diuretics can be used in cases of fluid overload in people with ascites. Anti-coagulation is required for all patient&#x27;s with Budd–Chiari syndrome, even if a cause of hypercoagulability is not found. Warfarin is the preferred, and best studied anticoagulant, but direct factor Xa inhibitors may also be used.

Many patients will require further intervention. Some forms of Budd–Chiari may be treated with surgical shunts (such as portacaval shunt) to divert blood flow around the obstruction or the liver itself. Shunts must be placed early after diagnosis for best results. TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) has replaced shunt surgery as it is less invasive and overcomes intrahepatic outflow obstruction by diverting hepatic and portal blood flow to the inferior vena cava. TIPS accomplishes the same goal as a surgical shunt but has a lower procedure-related mortality, a factor that has led to a growth in its popularity. It is very effective in treating ascites and preventing further variceal bleeding. The TIPS procedure has shown to have good outcomes, with a 78% five-year transplant-free survival rate. If all the hepatic veins are blocked, the portal vein can be approached via the intrahepatic part of inferior vena cava, a procedure called DIPS (direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt).

Segmental occlusions of the inferior vena cava or portal vein can be treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in which a balloon is passed via a guidewire to the site of the venous obstruction and then inflated to open the blockage, this may be followed by stent placement (either immediate stent placement or deferred (when the stent is placed later, if needed)).

Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for Budd–Chiari. It is generally reserved for patients with fulminant liver failure, failure of shunts, or progression of cirrhosis that reduces the life expectancy to one year. Survival rates in Budd–Chiari syndrome after liver transplantation are 76%, 71% and 68% after 1, 5 and 10 years respectively. It is recommended to continue anticoagulant treatment after liver transplantation, especially if the secondary or primary cause of hypercoagulability is still present, and to monitor for blood clots after liver transplantation.

Pregnancy is not contraindicated in those with Budd Chiari syndrome and if it occurs, anticoagulants should be continued with low molecular weight heparin as the preferred agent, as warfarin is teratogenic (associated with birth defects). Budd Chiari syndrome in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and prematurity. Screening for esophageal varices is recommended in the second trimester, especially in those not on beta blocker prophylaxis. Screening for portopulmonary hypertension is also recommended for all pregnant patients with Budd Chiari syndrome.

==Prognosis==
Several studies have attempted to predict the survival of patients with Budd–Chiari syndrome. In general, nearly two-thirds of patients with Budd–Chiari are alive at 10 years. Important negative prognostic indicators include ascites, encephalopathy, elevated Child–Pugh scores, elevated prothrombin time, and altered serum levels of various substances (sodium, creatinine, albumin, and bilirubin). Survival is also highly dependent on the underlying cause of the Budd–Chiari syndrome. For example, a patient with an underlying myeloproliferative disorder may progress to acute leukemia, independently of Budd–Chiari syndrome.

==Eponym==
It is named after George Budd, a British physician, and Hans Chiari, an Austrian pathologist.

<text>The county football associations are the local governing bodies of association football in England and the Crown dependencies. County FAs exist to govern all aspects of football in England. They are responsible for administering club and player registration as well as promoting development amongst those bodies and referees.

There are currently 50 county FAs. Most county FAs align roughly along historic county boundaries, although some cover more than one county, and some of the major cities, particularly those with a strong football tradition, have their own FAs. The Sheffield FA was the first to be created, in 1867. Additionally, the three branches of the British Armed Forces, as well as the Amateur Football Alliance, which has a strong presence in the south-east of England, are listed as having their own County FAs not corresponding to geography.
County football associations host &#x27;county cups&#x27; – knockout cup competitions held at a sub-regional level, which are open to affiliated members of the county FA. Typically, county FAs will host cup competitions at the following levels: senior, intermediate, junior, women&#x27;s, veterans, senior Sunday football, intermediate Sunday football and junior Sunday football.

There are an additional five recognised bodies that have representation on the FA Council on the same level as County FAs.

<doc id="584875" wikidata="Q323508" url="?curid=584875" title="Gordon R. England">
<text>Gordon Richard England (born September 15, 1937) is an American politician and businessman who was the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense and twice served as the U.S. Secretary of the Navy in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush.

== Early life ==
England was born on September 15, 1937 in Baltimore, Maryland. England attended Mount Saint Joseph High School, graduating with the class of 1955.

== Education ==
England received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1961 and an MBA from the Texas Christian University in 1975. He was a member of several fraternities including Beta Gamma Sigma (business), Omicron Delta Kappa (leadership) and Eta Kappa Nu (electrical engineering).

==Career==

England started his business career in 1966 at Honeywell where he was an engineer on the Project Gemini space program. He worked for Litton Industries as a program manager on the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft for the United States Navy. He was also CEO of GRE Consultants.

By 1977 he was employed by General Dynamics Fort Worth Division where he held various posts including Director of Avionics. He was later named as the Vice President of Engineering, and later President and general manager, of General Dynamics Land Systems Division, eventually transitioning back to General Dynamics Fort Worth as Division President. England remained in that post when General Dynamics sold the Fort Worth Division to Lockheed; later becoming President of that corporation for four years.

England returned to General Dynamics as Executive Vice President of the Combat Systems Group. He served from 1997 to 2001 as Executive Vice President of General Dynamics where he had overall responsibility for Information Systems and International sectors.

England transferred from the business world to government during the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush serving in a number of key roles, having previously served as a member of the Defense Science Board.

===72nd Secretary of the Navy===
England was a controversial choice for Secretary of the Navy due to his lack of any military service experience and his long career in the defense industry including his most recent appointment as Executive Vice President of General Dynamics Corporation. Critics such as William D. Hartung, Head of the Arms Trade Resource Center, felt that it was inappropriate to appoint businessmen whose companies would be the prime benefactor of any increase in defense spending. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld however had decided to make corporate experience one of the key requirements in his appointees as was reported in the &quot;Washington Times&quot;. This policy led to England&#x27;s appointment alongside other leading industrialists including James Roche and Thomas E. White. England was sworn in on May 24, 2001. He is reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as having announced that one of his key aims in the role was the development of &quot;futuristic weapons to counter new types of threats emerging in the post-Soviet world.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reports that during his time in this role &quot;England has joined with Adm. Vernon Clark, chief of naval operations, in directing some of the most sweeping change the service has seen in decades.&quot; The report goes on to list the following;

* Retiring dozens of ships
* Shedding thousands of jobs,
* Consolidating Navy and Marine Corps tactical aviation forces
* Juggling crew deployments to keep some ships at sea longer
* Devising plans to surge more warships into action faster during a crisis.

By an instruction dated May 31, 2002, England directed all United States Navy ships to fly the first navy jack in honor of those killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks. The jack is to be flown for the duration of the War on Terrorism.

England left the post in January 2003 for a new position within the administration.

===1st Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security===

On January 24, 2003, England took up his new role as Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security in the newly formed United States Department of Homeland Security. Although England&#x27;s stint in this post was brief, a close associate quoted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; states that it &quot;broadened his exposure to the White House and his &#x27;contact base&#x27; in Washington.&quot;

===73rd Secretary of the Navy===
England was recalled to once again take on the role of Secretary of the Navy after just a few months following the suicide of his nominated replacement Colin R. McMillan. England was sworn in on October 1, 2003, becoming only the second person to hold the post twice and the first to serve back-to-back terms. According to a close associate quoted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, England&#x27;s time in the United States Department of Homeland Security had &quot;expanded [his] view of the administration&#x27;s war on terrorism&quot;, which led to a number of initiatives that he pursued in his second term at the Pentagon including stronger ties between the Navy and Coast Guard and a greater assistance to marines on the front lines in Iraq.

In June 2004, a Supreme Court ruling granted prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba the right to plead their cases in U.S. courts. As the BBC pointed out the 600 detainees had been in legal limbo since their capture during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, during which time only three detainees had been charged and several dozen had been sent back home following diplomatic pressure from other nations. England was appointed to head the review that was conducted in secret by a panel consisting of three military officers to whom prisoners were given the chance to provide facts to support their case for release. England made clear that &quot;The question is: Are they still threats to America? It&#x27;s not guilt or innocence.&quot; As a result of this review 38 prisoners were released due to a lack of evidence that England referred to as ‘thin files’.

England was succeeded as Secretary of the Navy by Donald C. Winter.

===Deputy Secretary of Defense===
England was nominated as Deputy Secretary of Defense on May 13, 2005, and immediately took up the role in an acting capacity while awaiting his confirmation. His replacement of Paul Wolfowitz has been looked upon favorably in the media with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commenting, &quot;England has a reputation for being less ideological than Wolfowitz and more attuned to the administrative demands of the Pentagon&#x27;s second-ranking civilian job&#x27;&quot; but critics still maintain that his prime loyalty remains to the defense industry. England was recess appointed to the full Deputy Secretary position on January 4, 2006, by President Bush. He resigned with the incoming Obama administration.

===Acting Secretary of Defense===
On January 22, 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told reporters he would hand off his duties to Gordon R. England during his January 23 surgery. On January 23, 2009, while Gates underwent two hours of surgery to repair a torn tendon in his left biceps, Gordon England was in charge of the Pentagon. England continued this service while Gates recovered from the surgery. During this time, England was the acting Defense Secretary.

==Other activities and awards==
England has been involved with various civic, charitable and government organizations. He was a city councilman, as well as vice-chair on the board of Goodwill Industries. He was on the USO&#x27;s Board of Governors, the Defense Science Board, the Board of Visitors at Texas Christian University, and others.

He has been recognized for numerous professional and service contributions from multiple organizations such as Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Maryland; the Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Award; the Silver Beaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America; the Silver Knight of Management Award from the National Management Association; the Henry M. Jackson Award and the IEEE Centennial Award.

England was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2012 for advances in digital avionics for aircraft, land, and naval platforms. He is also a member of the Naval Order of the United States.

<doc id="584877" wikidata="Q4740523" url="?curid=584877" title="Amateur Football Alliance">
<text>The Amateur Football Alliance is a county football association in England. It is unusual among county FAs in not serving a particular geographical area. It was founded in 1906 as the Amateur Football Defence Council, was briefly known as the Amateur Football Defence Federation, and was reformed as the Amateur Football Association in 1907, when The FA required all county associations to admit professional clubs. Its aim was, as the decline of amateurism at the highest levels of football set in, to protect and preserve the original amateur spirit. It prides itself on the skill and competitiveness of its leagues, and on its traditions of fair play and respect for opponents and match officials. Many leagues still maintain rules that require clubs to provide food and drink to their opponents and match officials after the match in a clubhouse or public house.

==History==

With tension between amateur clubs and the Football Association mounting due to the rise of professionalism, the organisation was formed in May 1906 as the Amateur Football Defence Council, following unanimous agreement at a meeting of around 100 clubs from the London metropolitan area. In September 1906, the AFDC warned the London FA that its clubs would be boycotting the London Senior Cup the following season. Later that month, the organisation was renamed the Amateur Football Defence Federation.

===Split from football association===

Following the general meeting of The Football Association on 31 May 1907, it was decided by the Federation that in the best interest of amateur football that a new and separate organisation must be created. The inaugural meeting of the Amateur Football Association was held in the Crown Room of the Holborn Restaurant on 7 July 1907. They were addressed by Alfred Lyttelton MP, before B.A. Glanville of Clapham Rovers proposed the formation of the Association, which was seconded by N.C. Bailey. It was stated that the foundation of the Association wasn&#x27;t in opposition to professionalism in sport but instead to the &quot;fungus growth which had become attached to the machinery of football management&quot;. Lord Alverstone was elected as the first president of the new society, and the Corinthians offered to provide a trophy for a new cup competition. The existing Federation committee was elected to the new organisation.

===Football association ban on amateur players and clubs===

The Football Association responded by banning amateur players from playing for professional clubs, and resulted in the end of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield after the FA refused to provide a professional team for the match, and barred all its members from either playing or providing facilities. However a later resolution by the FA meant that any player who had played for his school, college or university team which was a member of the Amateur Football Association was not banned from playing for a professional team. Furthermore, the FA asked the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Football Association not to recognise the formation of the AFA.

A number of teams were forced to choose between one association or the other. Cambridge University pledged their allegiance to the Amateur Football Association and in response, so did Oxford University although they would have preferred to remain neutral between the two. Both the Leicestershire and Essex Football Association were early supporters of the actions of the Football Association against the AFA. Meanwhile, both the Army and Royal Navy Football Associations took the question of which Association to support by holding a vote of its member clubs; this resulting in both remaining with the Football Association.

The AFA tried to join FIFA, but it was not admitted, so it founded UIAFA along with French USFSA and Bohemian ČSF in March 1909.

===Ban repealed===

The schism lasted until 1914, when the FA agreed to allow the AFA to retain its amateur policy. The AFA, Oxford, Cambridge, and the public schools would each nominate one member of the FA Council, with the AFA also represented on the national team selection committee and Amateur Cup committee. A maximum of twelve clubs per year (four from one county) could join the AFA.

Two current AFA clubs are former FA Cup winners: Old Etonians and Old Carthusians, who both currently play in the Arthurian League. Past members of the AFA include Ipswich Town, Barnet, Cambridge City, the Casuals and the Corinthians. Sir Stanley Rous, who was president of FIFA, was also the president of the AFA. The AFA&#x27;s flagship competition is the AFA Senior Cup which is contested by AFA-affiliated clubs on Saturday afternoons. Most of these clubs enter one of the three AFA-affiliated Saturday leagues, the Southern Amateur League, Amateur Football Combination and the Arthurian League, the SAL having been founded in the same year as the AFA (1907) by more or less the same group of people.

The AFA&#x27;s heartland is in London and the Home Counties.

The organisation changed its name to the Amateur Football Alliance in April 1934.

<text>Manos Loïzos (; 1937–1982) was one of the most important Greek music composers of the 20th century.

==Biography==
He was born on 22 October 1937 to Greek Cypriot immigrants in Alexandria, Egypt. His parents came from the small village of Agioi Vavatsinias, in the district of Larnaca, Cyprus. Loizos moved to Athens at the age of 17 intending to study pharmacology but soon gave up his studies in order to concentrate on his musical career. He was a self-taught musician, with no formal musical arts training. His first recordings were made in 1963 but he started gaining a larger audience after 1967. By 1975 Loizos had become one of the most popular artists in Greek music.

He died on 17 September 1982 in a hospital in Moscow, Soviet Union after suffering several strokes. He was well known for his leftist political ideology and was an outspoken critic of the Greek military junta. He was also an active member of the Communist Party of Greece. The year 2007 was declared &quot;Manos Loizos Year&quot; in Greece.

==Discography==
He composed many well-known Greek songs and has co-operated with various important composers, singers and lyricists like Mikis Theodorakis, Haris Alexiou, George Dalaras, Vasilis Papakonstantinou, Christos Leontis, Fondas Ladis, Yannis Negrepontis, Manolis Rasoulis, Giannis Kalatzis, Nâzım Hikmet and many others. His best known co-operation was with his very personal friend, lyricist Lefteris Papadopoulos who wrote the lyrics of many of Loizos&#x27; most successful hits.

Some of Loizos&#x27; most famous songs are : 
*&quot;Ola se thymizoun (Everything Reminds Me of You)&quot; Lyrics: Manolis Rassoulis
*&quot;Jamaica&quot; Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos
*&quot;S&#x27; Akoloutho (I follow you)&quot; Lyrics: himself
*&quot;To Akordeon (The Accordion)&quot; Lyrics: Yannis Negrepontis
*&quot;O Dromos (The Street)&quot; Lyrics: Kostoula Mitropoulos
*&quot;Che&quot; (dedicated to Che Guevara) Lyrics: himself
*&quot;Ah Helidoni mu (Ah, my swallow)&quot; Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos
*&quot;De Tha Ksanagapiso (I Shall not Love Again)&quot; Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos
*&quot;Paporaki tou Burnova (Paporaki of Burnova)&quot; Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos
*&quot;O Koutalianos&quot; Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos
*&quot;Evdokia&quot; (Instrumental Zeibekiko)
*&quot;Kalimera Ilie (Goodmorning Sun)&quot; Lyrics: Manos Loizos. During the 1981-1989 period the song was used as trademark by the political movement PASOK

In 1985, a big concert dedicated to his memory took place in the Athens Olympic Stadium, attended by more than 50,000 people with singers George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Giannis Kalatzis, Dimitra Galani and Vasilis Papakonstantinou performing. Manos Loizos&#x27; songs and music remain popular until today among all ages of the Greek society.

<text>Joseph Francis Michael Morris (born September 13, 1955) is an American jazz guitarist, bassist, composer, and educator.

==Early life==
Morris was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on September 13, 1955. He switched from trumpet to guitar at the age of fourteen. He was self-taught. His interest in jazz began two years later, after attending a John McLaughlin concert and listening to John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Pharoah Sanders recordings.

==Later life and career==
Morris moved to Boston in 1975, &quot;where his unique approach was not initially accepted in the then-prevalent modal jazz scene. Despite this temporary setback, and some time spent playing guitar in Europe, he developed a pivotal collaborative relationship with multi-instrumentalist Lowell Davidson, whose unique sound explorations inspired him to further develop his own original approach to music making&quot;. Morris formed his first trio in 1977.

In 1981 Morris formed his own record company, Riti, for his own recordings. He has led a group called Sweatshop, the sextet Racket Club, and quartets featuring, separately, Mat Maneri, Jamie Saft, and Rob Brown.

In 1994 he became the first guitarist to lead his own session for Black Saint/Soul Note, with &quot;Symbolic Gesture&quot;. He has continued to record extensively for many labels such as Knitting Factory, AUM Fidelity, and Hathut. In addition to leading his own groups, he has recorded and performed with, among others: Matthew Shipp, William Parker, Joe Maneri, and Ivo Perelman.

He has lectured and conducted workshops throughout the US and Europe. He is a former member of the faculty of Tufts University Extension College and is on the faculty at New England Conservatory in the jazz and improvisation department.

==Influences and style==
Morris cites as influences Cecil Taylor, Jimmy Lyons, Eric Dolphy, Leroy Jenkins, Thelonious Monk, Jimi Hendrix, and West African string music. Morris has created his own approach to playing and composing. &quot;He usually incorporates a clean tone of the bebop lineage for his single-note-driven improvisations&quot;.
He also plays banjolele.

<text>An optical coating is one or more thin layers of material deposited on an optical component such as a lens, prism or mirror, which alters the way in which the optic reflects and transmits light. These coatings have become a key technology in the field of optics. One type of optical coating is an anti-reflective coating, which reduces unwanted reflections from surfaces, and is commonly used on spectacle and camera lenses. Another type is the high-reflector coating, which can be used to produce mirrors that reflect greater than 99.99% of the light that falls on them. More complex optical coatings exhibit high reflection over some range of wavelengths, and anti-reflection over another range, allowing the production of dichroic thin-film filters.

==Types of coating==
The simplest optical coatings are thin layers of metals, such as aluminium, which are deposited on glass substrates to make mirror surfaces, a process known as silvering. The metal used determines the reflection characteristics of the mirror; aluminium is the cheapest and most common coating, and yields a reflectivity of around 88%-92% over the visible spectrum. More expensive is silver, which has a reflectivity of 95%-99% even into the far infrared, but suffers from decreasing reflectivity (&lt;90%) in the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions. Most expensive is gold, which gives excellent (98%-99%) reflectivity throughout the infrared, but limited reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 550 nm, resulting in the typical gold colour.

By controlling the thickness and density of metal coatings, it is possible to decrease the reflectivity and increase the transmission of the surface, resulting in a &quot;half-silvered mirror&quot;. These are sometimes used as &quot;one-way mirrors&quot;.

The other major type of optical coating is the dielectric coating (i.e. using materials with a different refractive index to the substrate). These are constructed from thin layers of materials such as magnesium fluoride, calcium fluoride, and various metal oxides, which are deposited onto the optical substrate. By careful choice of the exact composition, thickness, and number of these layers, it is possible to tailor the reflectivity and transmitivity of the coating to produce almost any desired characteristic. Reflection coefficients of surfaces can be reduced to less than 0.2%, producing an &quot;antireflection&quot; (AR) coating. Conversely, the reflectivity can be increased to greater than 99.99%, producing a &quot;high-reflector&quot; (HR) coating. The level of reflectivity can also be tuned to any particular value, for instance to produce a mirror that reflects 90% and transmits 10% of the light that falls on it, over some range of wavelengths. Such mirrors are often used as beamsplitters, and as output couplers in lasers. Alternatively, the coating can be designed such that the mirror reflects light only in a narrow band of wavelengths, producing an optical filter.

The versatility of dielectric coatings leads to their use in many scientific optical instruments (such as lasers, optical microscopes, refracting telescopes, and interferometers) as well as consumer devices such as binoculars, spectacles, and photographic lenses.

Dielectric layers are sometimes applied over top of metal films, either to provide a protective layer (as in silicon dioxide over aluminium), or to enhance the reflectivity of the metal film. Metal and dielectric combinations are also used to make advanced coatings that cannot be made any other way. One example is the so-called &quot;perfect mirror&quot;, which exhibits high (but not perfect) reflection, with unusually low sensitivity to wavelength, angle, and polarization.

===Antireflection coatings===
Antireflection coatings are used to reduce reflection from surfaces. Whenever a ray of light moves from one medium to another (such as when light enters a sheet of glass after travelling through air), some portion of the light is reflected from the surface (known as the &quot;interface&quot;) between the two media.

A number of different effects are used to reduce reflection. The simplest is to use a thin layer of material at the interface, with an index of refraction between those of the two media. The reflection is minimized when 
:formula_1,
where formula_2 is the index of the thin layer, and formula_3 and formula_4 are the indices of the two media. The optimum refractive indices for multiple coating layers at angles of incidence other than 0° is given by Moreno et al. (2005).

Such coatings can reduce the reflection for ordinary glass from about 4% per surface to around 2%. These were the first type of antireflection coating known, having been discovered by Lord Rayleigh in 1886. He found that old, slightly tarnished pieces of glass transmitted more light than new, clean pieces due to this effect.

Practical antireflection coatings rely on an intermediate layer not only for its direct reduction of reflection coefficient, but also use the interference effect of a thin layer. If the layer&#x27;s thickness is controlled precisely such that it is exactly one-quarter of the wavelength of the light in the layer (a &quot;quarter-wave coating&quot;), the reflections from the front and back sides of the thin layer will destructively interfere and cancel each other.
In practice, the performance of a simple one-layer interference coating is limited by the fact that the reflections only exactly cancel for one wavelength of light at one angle, and by difficulties finding suitable materials. For ordinary glass (&quot;n&quot;≈1.5), the optimum coating index is &quot;n&quot;≈1.23. Few useful substances have the required refractive index. Magnesium fluoride (MgF2) is often used, since it is hard-wearing and can be easily applied to substrates using physical vapour deposition, even though its index is higher than desirable (n=1.38). With such coatings, reflection as low as 1% can be achieved on common glass, and better results can be obtained on higher index media.

Further reduction is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximum destructive interference. By using two or more layers, broadband antireflection coatings which cover the visible range (400-700 nm) with maximum reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable. Reflection in narrower wavelength bands can be as low as 0.1%. Alternatively, a series of layers with small differences in refractive index can be used to create a broadband antireflective coating by means of a refractive index gradient.

===High-reflection coatings===

High-reflection (HR) coatings work the opposite way to antireflection coatings. The general idea is usually based on the periodic layer system composed from two materials, one with a high index, such as zinc sulfide (&quot;n&quot;=2.32) or titanium dioxide (&quot;n&quot;=2.4), and one with a low index, such as magnesium fluoride (&quot;n&quot;=1.38) or silicon dioxide (&quot;n&quot;=1.49). This periodic system significantly enhances the reflectivity of the surface in the certain wavelength range called band-stop, whose width is determined by the ratio of the two used indices only (for quarter-wave systems), while the maximum reflectivity increases up to almost 100% with a number of layers in the &quot;stack&quot;. The thicknesses of the layers are generally quarter-wave (then they yield to the broadest high reflection band in comparison to the non-quarter-wave systems composed from the same materials), this time designed such that reflected beams &quot;constructively&quot; interfere with one another to maximize reflection and minimize transmission. The best of these coatings built-up from deposited dielectric lossless materials on perfectly smooth surfaces can reach reflectivities greater than 99.999% (over a fairly narrow range of wavelengths). Common HR coatings can achieve 99.9% reflectivity over a broad wavelength range (tens of nanometers in the visible spectrum range).

As for AR coatings, HR coatings are affected by the incidence angle of the light. When used away from normal incidence, the reflective range shifts to shorter wavelengths, and becomes polarization dependent. This effect can be exploited to produce coatings that polarize a light beam.

By manipulating the exact thickness and composition of the layers in the reflective stack, the reflection characteristics can be tuned to a particular application, and may incorporate both high-reflective and anti-reflective wavelength regions. The coating can be designed as a long- or short-pass filter, a bandpass or notch filter, or a mirror with a specific reflectivity (useful in lasers). For example, the dichroic prism assembly used in some cameras requires two dielectric coatings, one long-wavelength pass filter reflecting light below 500 nm (to separate the blue component of the light), and one short-pass filter to reflect red light, above 600 nm wavelength. The remaining transmitted light is the green component.

====Extreme ultraviolet coatings====
In the EUV portion of the spectrum (wavelengths shorter than about 30 nm) nearly all materials absorb strongly, making it difficult to focus or otherwise manipulate light in this wavelength range. Telescopes such as TRACE or EIT that form images with EUV light use multilayer mirrors that are constructed of hundreds of alternating layers of a high-mass metal such as molybdenum or tungsten, and a low-mass spacer such as silicon, vacuum deposited onto a substrate such as glass. Each layer pair is designed to have a thickness equal to half the wavelength of light to be reflected. Constructive interference between scattered light from each layer causes the mirror to reflect EUV light of the desired wavelength as would a normal metal mirror in visible light. Using multilayer optics it is possible to reflect up to 70% of incident EUV light (at a particular wavelength chosen when the mirror is constructed).

===Transparent conductive coatings===
Transparent conductive coatings are used in applications where it is important that the coating conduct electricity or dissipate static charge. Conductive coatings are used to protect the aperture from electromagnetic interference, while dissipative coatings are used to prevent the build-up of static electricity. Transparent conductive coatings are also used extensively to provide electrodes in situations where light is required to pass, for example in flat panel display technologies and in many photoelectrochemical experiments. A common substance used in transparent conductive coatings is indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is not very optically transparent, however. The layers must be thin to provide substantial transparency, particularly at the blue end of the spectrum. Using ITO, sheet resistances of 20 to 10,000 ohms per square can be achieved. An ITO coating may be combined with an antireflective coating to further improve transmittance. Other TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) include AZO (Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide), which offers much better UV transmission than ITO.
A special class of transparent conductive coatings applies to infrared films for theater-air military optics where IR transparent windows need to have (Radar) stealth (Stealth technology) properties. These are known as RAITs (Radar Attenuating / Infrared Transmitting) and include materials such as boron doped DLC (Diamond-like carbon).

===Phase correction coatings===


The multiple internal reflections in roof prisms cause a polarization-dependent phase-lag of the transmitted light, in a manner similar to a Fresnel rhomb. This must be suppressed by multilayer &quot;phase-correction coatings&quot; applied to one of the roof surfaces to avoid unwanted interference effects and a loss of contrast in the image. Dielectric phase-correction prism coatings are applied in a vacuum chamber with maybe 30 different superimposed vapor coating layers deposits, making it a complex production process.

In a roof prism without a phase-correcting coating, s-polarized and p-polarized light each acquire a different geometric phase as they pass through the upper prism. When the two polarized components are recombined, interference between the s-polarized and p-polarized light results in a different intensity distribution perpendicular to the roof edge as compared to that along the roof edge. This effect reduces contrast and resolution in the image perpendicular to the roof edge, producing an inferior image compared to that from a porro prism erecting system. This roof edge diffraction effect may also be seen as a diffraction spike perpendicular to the roof edge generated by bright points in the image. In technical optics, such a phase is also known as the Pancharatnam phase, and in quantum physics an equivalent phenomenon is known as the Berry phase.

This effect can be seen in the elongation of the Airy disk in the direction perpendicular to the crest of the roof as this is a diffraction from the discontinuity at the roof crest.

The unwanted interference effects are suppressed by vapour-depositing a special dielectric coating known as a phase-compensating coating on the roof surfaces of the roof prism. These &quot;phase-correction coating&quot; or &quot;P-coating&quot; on the roof surfaces was developed in 1988 by Adolf Weyrauch at Carl Zeiss Other manufacturers followed soon, and since then phase-correction coatings are used across the board in medium and high-quality roof prism binoculars. This coating corrects for the difference in geometric phase between s- and p-polarized light so both have effectively the same phase shift, preventing image-degrading interference.

From a technical point of view, the phase-correction coating layer does not correct the actual phase shift, but rather the partial polarization of the light that results from total reflection. Such a correction can always only be made for a selected wavelength and for a specific angle of incidence; however, it is possible to approximately correct a roof prism for polychromatic light by superimposing several layers. In this way, since the 1990s, roof prism binoculars have also achieved resolution values that were previously only achievable with porro prisms. The presence of a phase-correction coating can be checked on unopened binoculars using two polarization filters.

===Fano-resonant optical coatings===

Fano-resonant optical coatings (FROCs) represent a new category of optical coatings. FROCs exhibit the photonic Fano resonance by coupling a broadband nanocavity, which serves as the continuum, with a narrowband Fabry–Perot nanocavity, representing the discrete state. The interference between these two resonances manifests as an asymmetric Fano-resonance line-shape. FROCs are considered a separate category of optical coatings because they enjoy optical properties that cannot be reproduced using other optical coatings. Mainly, semi-transparent FROCs act as a beam splitting filter that reflects and transmits the same color, a property that cannot be achieved with transmission filters, dielectric mirrors, or semi-transparent metals.

FROCs enjoy remarkable structural coloring properties, as they can produce colors across a wide color gamut with both high brightness and high purity. Moreover, the dependence of color on the angle of incident light can be controlled through the dielectric cavity material, making FROCs adaptable for applications requiring either angle-independent or angle-dependent coloring. This includes decorative purposes and anti-counterfeit measures.

FROCs were used as both monolithic spectrum splitters and selective solar absorbers, which makes them suitable for hybrid solar-thermal energy generation. They can be designed to reflect specific wavelength ranges, aligning with the energy band gap of photovoltaic cells, while absorbing the remaining solar spectrum. This enables higher photovoltaic efficiency at elevated optical concentrations by reducing the photovoltaic&#x27;s cell temperature. The reduced temperature also increases the cell&#x27;s lifetime. Additionally, their low infrared emissivity minimizes thermal losses, increasing the system&#x27;s overall optothermal efficiency.

<text>An artifact or artefact (British English) is a general term for an item made or given shape by humans, such as a tool or a work of art, especially an object of archaeological interest. In archaeology, the word has become a term of particular nuance; it is defined as an object recovered by archaeological endeavor, including cultural artifacts (of cultural interest).

&quot;Artifact&quot; is the general term used in archaeology, while in museums the equivalent general term is normally &quot;object&quot;, and in art history perhaps artwork or a more specific term such as &quot;carving&quot;. The same item may be called all or any of these in different contexts, and more specific terms will be used when talking about individual objects, or groups of similar ones.

Artifacts exist in many different forms and can sometimes be confused with ecofacts and features; all three of these can sometimes be found together at archaeological sites. They can also exist in different types of context depending on the processes that have acted on them over time. A wide variety of analyses take place to analyze artifacts and provide information on them. However, the process of analyzing artifacts through scientific archaeology can be hindered by the looting and collecting of artifacts, which sparks ethical debate.

==History==
From the emergence of the Hominids in the Stone Age, humanity has developed a handful of artifacts through time and place. There are archaeological sites and museums that obtain artifacts for physical evidence through past traces of civilizations, as well as norms and rituals, where objects attested a part of material culture.

==Context==
Artifacts can come from any archaeological context or source such as:
* Buried along with a body
* From any feature such as a midden or other domestic setting
* Votive offerings
* Hoards, such as in wells
Examples include stone tools, pottery vessels, metal objects such as weapons and items of personal adornment such as buttons, jewelry and clothing. Bones that show signs of human modification are also examples. Natural objects, such as fire cracked rocks from a hearth or plant material used for food, are classified by archaeologists as ecofacts rather than as artifacts.
Artifacts exist as a result of behavioral and transformational processes. A behavioral process involves acquiring raw materials, manufacturing these for a specific purpose and then discarding after use. Transformational processes begin at the end of behavioral processes; this is when the artifact is changed by nature and/or humans after it has been deposited. Both of these processes are significant factors in evaluating the context of an artifact. 

The context of an artifact can be broken into two categories: primary context and secondary context. A matrix is a physical setting within which an artifact exists, and a provenience refers to a specific location within a matrix. When an artifact is found in the realm of primary context, the matrix and provenience have not been changed by transformational processes. However, the matrix and provenience are changed by transformational processes when referring to secondary context. Artifacts exist in both contexts, and this is taken into account during the analysis of them. Another important type of context for archeologists, particularly from an art history perspective, is the term provenance, or the more general history of an artifact&#x27;s ownership, location, and importance.

Artifacts are distinguished from stratigraphic features and ecofacts. Stratigraphic features are non-portable remains of human activity that include hearths, roads, deposits, trenches and similar remains. Ecofacts, also referred to as biofacts, are objects of archaeological interest made by other organisms, such as seeds or animal bone.

Natural objects that humans have moved but not changed are called manuports. Examples include seashells moved inland or rounded pebbles placed away from the water action that made them.
These distinctions are often blurred; a bone removed from an animal carcass is a biofact but a bone carved into a useful implement is an artifact. Similarly there can be debate over early stone objects that could be either crude artifact or naturally occurring and happen to resemble early objects made by early humans or &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. It can be difficult to distinguish the differences between actual human-made lithic artifact and geofacts – naturally occurring lithics that resemble human-made tools. It is possible to authenticate artifacts by examining the general characteristics attributed to human-made tools and local characteristics of the site.

Artifacts, features and ecofacts can all be located together at sites. Sites may include different arrangements of the three; some might include all of them while others might only include one or two. Sites can have clear boundaries in the form of walls and moats, but this is not always the case. Sites can be distinguished through categories, such as location and past functions. How artifacts exist at these sites can provide archaeological insight. An example of this would be utilizing the position and depth of buried artifacts to determine a chronological timeline for past occurrences at the site.

Modern archaeologists take care to distinguish material culture from ethnicity, which is often more complex, as expressed by Carol Kramer in the dictum &quot;pots are not people.&quot;

== Analysis ==
Artifact analysis is determined by what type of artifact is being examined, the best.

Lithic analysis refers to analyzing artifacts that are created with stones and are often in the form of tools. Stone artifacts occur often throughout prehistoric times and are, therefore, a crucial aspect in answering archaeological questions about the past. On the surface, lithic artifacts can help archaeologists study how technology has developed throughout history by showing a variety of tools and manufacturing techniques from different periods of time. However, even deeper questions can be answered through this type of analysis; these questions can revolve around topics that include how societies were organized and structured in terms of socialization and the distribution of goods. The following lab techniques all contribute to the process of lithic analysis: petrographic analysis, neutron activation, x-ray fluorescence, particle-induced x-ray emission, individual flake analysis and mass analysis.

Another type of artifact analysis is ceramic analysis, which is based around the archaeological study of pottery. This type of analysis can help archaeologists gain information on the raw materials that were used and how they were utilized in the creation of pottery. Laboratory techniques that allow for this are mainly based around spectroscopy. The different types of spectroscopy used include atomic absorption, electrothermal atomic absorption, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission and x-ray fluorescence. Ceramic analysis does more than just provide information on raw materials and pottery production; it helps provide insight to past societies in terms of their technology, economy and social structure.

Additionally, faunal analysis exists to study artifacts in the form of animal remains. Just as with lithic artifacts, faunal remains are extremely common within the field of archaeology. Faunal analysis provides insight to trade due to animals being exchanged in different markets over time and being traded over long distances. Faunal remains can also provide information on social status, ethnic distinctions and dieting from previous complex societies.

Dating artifacts and providing them with a chronological timeline is a crucial part of artifact analysis. The different types of analyses above can all assist in the process of artifact dating. The major types of dating include relative dating, historical dating and typology. Relative dating occurs when artifacts are placed in a specific order in relation to one another while historical dating occurs for periods of written evidence; relative dating was the only form of dating for prehistoric periods of time. Typology is the process that groups together artifacts that are similar in material and shape. This strategy is based around the ideas that styles of objects match certain time periods and that these styles change slowly over time.

== Ethics ==

Artifact collecting and looting has sparked heavy debate in the archaeological realm. Looting in archaeological terms is when artifacts are dug up from sites and collected in private or sold before they are able to be excavated and analyzed through formal scientific archaeology. The debate is centered around the difference in beliefs between collectors and archaeologists. Archaeologists are focused on excavation, context and lab work when it comes to artifacts, while collectors are motivated by varying personal desires. This brings many to ask themselves the archaeological question, &quot;Who owns the past?&quot;

There are also ethical issues over the display of artifacts in museums which have been taken from other countries in questionable circumstances, for example the display of the Parthenon (Elgin) Marbles by the British Museum. The display of objects belonging to indigenous peoples of non-European countries by European museums – particularly those taken during the European conquest of Africa – has also raised ethical questions. Pan-African activists such as Mwazulu Diyabanza and the &quot;Front Multi Culturel Anti-Spoliation&quot; (Multicultural Front Against Pillaging) have taken direct action against European museums, aiming to restitute items they believe to belong to Africa.

<text>William Arthur &quot;Candy&quot; Cummings (October 18, 1848 – May 17, 1924) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a pitcher in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, and National League. Cummings is widely credited with inventing the curveball. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.

==Early life==
Cummings was born in Ware, Massachusetts, on October 18, 1848. Four years later, his family moved to Brooklyn, New York. He attended Falley Seminary in Fulton, New York, from 1864 to 1866, and played for Falley&#x27;s baseball team. He pitched his team to the county championship. After graduating from Falley, Cummings joined the Star Base Ball Club, one of Brooklyn&#x27;s best clubs, pitching for its junior squad. (Prior to the formal introduction of professional baseball in 1871, all baseball clubs were amateur.) Showing great promise, he was lured to another top Brooklyn club, Excelsior. At the age of 17, Cummings made his debut in the National Association of Base Ball Players with the Excelsior senior team. His first game with the Excelsior seniors was on August 14, 1866, against the New York Mutuals. For his performance, he received prophetic praise from the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;: &quot;[H]e has only to keep on in the way he has begun, and he will one day (not far distant) be ranked among the best pitchers of the country.&quot; Two weeks later, he led his team to a 2412 win against the Newark Eurekas. After the latter game, baseball writer Henry Chadwick commented on the skills of the young Cummings and his promising future with the Excelsior club. Cummings played for the Excelsiors next season, and continued as the main pitcher for the Stars of Brooklyn from 1868 to 1871.

His pitching skills led to his being called &quot;Candy&quot;, a popular 19th-century nickname for a man who was the best at his craft.

==Major league career==
Cummings, who stood 5&#x27;9&quot; and weighed 120 pounds, compiled a 145–94 career record and 2.42 earned run average while playing for five different professional teams from 1872 to 1877. Between 1872 and 1875, he pitched in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA) with the New York Mutuals, Baltimore Canaries, Philadelphia White Stockings and Hartford Dark Blues. Cummings won 63.3% of his games over his four NA seasons. In 1876, when the National League (NL) was founded, he was still with the Hartford club, which was one of the league&#x27;s founders, and compiled a 16–8 pitching record. In December 1876, he signed with a semi-professional club in Lynn, Massachusetts, the Live Oaks, to pitch and manage the club in 1877. He represented the Live Oaks at a convention that founded the International Association for Professional Base Ball Players, and was elected the association&#x27;s first president. In the middle of the 1877, he left the Live Oaks and returned to the NA, pitching for the Cincinnati Reds, where he appeared in only 19 games and posted a 5–14 win-loss record. Among other records, Cummings was the first player to pitch two complete games in one day: September 9, 1876, when he beat the Cincinnati Red Stockings twice, 14–4 and 8–4.

==Invention of the curveball==

Cummings is often credited with being the inventor of the curveball. In his biography of Cummings, published in 2022, Stephen Katz provides proof. According to Cummings, he discovered the idea of the curveball while studying the movement sea shells made when thrown. After noticing this movement, he began trying to make a baseball move the same way, and thus created the new pitch. Cummings pitched the curveball underhand, as required by the rules of the National Association of Base Ball Players, but with a twist and snap of the wrist, which was illegal under the rules of the National Association of Base Ball Players. Those rules required the pitcher to deliver pitches with a straight arm, swinging perpendicularly by his side. But the rules were progressively relaxed so as to permit the arm and wrist motion that were necessary for pitching the curveball.

Cummings first used the curveball in competition while pitching for Brooklyn&#x27;s Excelsior club, in a game on October 7, 1867, against the Harvard College team. He would later recall from that game: &quot;A surge of joy flooded over me that I shall never forget. I felt like shouting out that I had made a ball curve. ... But I said not a word and saw many a batter at that game throw down his stick in disgust.&quot; Cummings&#x27; introduction of the curveball radically changed pitching, and fundamentally transformed the game of baseball.

Several other pitchers claimed to have invented the curveball. One was Fred Goldsmith. Goldsmith maintained that he gave a demonstration of the pitch on August 16, 1870, at the Capitoline Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, and that renown sportswriter Henry Chadwick had covered it in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; on August 17, 1870. However, Stephen Katz, in his biography of Cummings, shows that Goldsmith&#x27;s claim was not credible, and that Goldsmith&#x27;s reference to an article by Chadwick in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; was likely fabricated. According to a 2002 article by ESPN&#x27;s Steve Wulf, Cummings was &quot;fairly well-connected&quot; in baseball, as evidenced by his position with the International Association. Baseball leaders Chadwick, Harry Wright and Albert Spalding, among others, credited Cummings as the inventor of the curveball.

== Invention of railway coupling device ==
In 1873, Cummings invented a railway coupling device, improving on the coupling device then in use, which was dangerous. He patented his invention in 1874. He refined his design in 1876, and patented it in 1877. Cummings received a small royalty for his invention throughout his life.

==Later life==
After organized baseball, Cummings moved to Athol, Massachusetts, where he owned and operated a paint and wallpaper shop. Cummings died in Toledo, Ohio, on May 17, 1924. He is buried at Aspen Grove Cemetery in Ware, Massachusetts. Cummings was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.

<text>Imaste dio, Ímaste dió or Eimaste dio (, meaning &#x27;We are two&#x27;) is a song by Mikis Theodorakis, the leftist Greek composer and politician.

==Background==
&quot;Ímaste dió&quot; was one of the songs written by Mikis Theodorakis for prominent member of the Greek left Andreas Lentakis (1935-1997) towards the end of the 1960s. At the time of the 7 year military dictatorship in Greece this song, whose theme was the torture and isolation of a political detainee in prison, became a major rallying cry of the Greek leftwing political groups. The song is also featured in a comedy by Thanasis Veggos about the forbidden songs in Greece during the time of the Colonels.

==Versions==
A French version of Eimaste Dio, &quot;Nous sommes deux&quot;, was popularized by singer Georges Moustaki in the 1970s. A second version was recorded with different lyrics by singer Dalida with the title &quot;A chaque fois j&#x27;y crois&quot; in 1977.

A Swedish version, &quot;Två&quot;, was recorded by singer Sven-Bertil Taube in 1974.

<doc id="584906" wikidata="Q3180075" url="?curid=584906" title="Joe Gordon">
<text>Joseph Lowell Gordon (February 18, 1915 – April 14, 1978), nicknamed &quot;Flash&quot;, in reference to the comic-book character &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, was an American second baseman, coach and manager in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians from 1938 to 1950. He was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009.

Gordon was the outstanding player at his position during the 1940s, winning the American League MVP Award and being named to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Major League All-Star Team in nine of his eleven seasons. Known for his acrobatic defense, he led the AL in assists four times and in double plays three times. He was the first AL second baseman to hit 20 home runs in a season, doing so seven times, is second all-time for career home runs at second base (246) behind Robinson Canó, and he held the single-season record until 2001. He played a major role on the champion Indians, leading the team in homers and runs batted in. He ranked sixth in major league history in double plays (1,160) upon retiring, and was sixth in AL history in games (1,519), putouts (3,600), assists (4,706) and total chances (8,566) and seventh in fielding percentage (.970).

==Early life==
Gordon was born in Los Angeles, on February 18, 1915, to Benjamin Lowell Gordon (1875–1946) and Lulu Pearl Evans (1893–1984). The family moved to Oregon, where he attended Jefferson High School. After graduation, Gordon attended the University of Oregon, where he also competed as a halfback on the football team as well as in gymnastics, soccer and the long jump. Not limiting himself to sports, he also played the violin in the college orchestra. Playing on the Ducks baseball team during the 1934 and 1935 seasons, Gordon helped lead the team to a combined record of 30-14 – winning the Pacific Coast Conference&#x27;s Northern Division both years. Gordon hit .358 while at Oregon which ranks him tied for fourth in team history. While in college, Gordon was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Playing career==
===New York Yankees===
After batting .418 in his sophomore year, he signed with the Yankees in 1936, with scout Bill Essick reporting: &quot;(Gordon was) at his best when it meant the most and the going was toughest.&quot; After being assigned to the Yankees AA-level club, the Oakland Oaks, in the Pacific Coast League, Gordon proceeded to put up solid numbers in his first season in professional baseball, hitting .300 while spending the majority of time in the field at shortstop. In 1937, Gordon was moved to the Newark Bears, another AA team in the International League and continued to excel, hitting .280 with 26 home runs. His 1937 Bears&#x27; team is often regarded as the best minor league team in history with future all-stars George McQuinn, Charlie Keller, Tommy Henrich, Babe Dahlgren, and Spud Chandler joining Gordon to lead the team to an incredible 110 wins in 158 games.

Gordon&#x27;s success led to the release of 33-year-old Tony Lazzeri following the 1937 season, and he made his debut with the Yankees in April . His 25 home runs as a rookie set an American League record for second basemen, surpassing Detroit Tiger Charlie Gehringer&#x27;s previous record of 19. Gordon would hold the AL record for home runs by a second baseman 64 years before being surpassed by Bret Boone&#x27;s 36 home runs in 2001. Along with Jeff Heath of the Indians, who had batted .343, Gordon was one of the AL&#x27;s top rookies, hitting .255 with 97 RBI and placing second to Gehringer in the AL with 450 assists as the Yankees won their third straight pennant. In the 1938 World Series sweep of the Chicago Cubs, he hit .400 and slugged .733. He had an RBI single, doubled, and recorded the final out in a 3-1 victory in Game 1. Gordon doubled in the first two runs in Game 2&#x27;s 6-3 win. In Game 3, a 5-2 win, he had a solo home run to tie the game 1-1 in the fifth inning, and singled home two more runs in the sixth. He scored twice in an 8-3 win in the final Game 4 as New York took their third consecutive title.

 saw Gordon improve his batting average to .284 and top his own home run mark with 28. He led the AL in putouts, assists and double plays, and was second on the team to Joe DiMaggio and fifth in the league in both homers and RBI (111). On June 28 he hit three home runs; he made his first of nine All-Star teams, and finished ninth in the MVP vote. In the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds he hit only .143, but scored the first run in a 2-1 Game 1 victory. In Game 4, he drove in the tying run with one out in the ninth inning, and the Yankees scored three in the tenth to win 7-4 and complete another sweep for their fourth straight championship. In Gordon again increased his home run total to 30 and was second on the team to DiMaggio in homers and RBI (103), leading the AL in assists and posting career highs in runs (112), triples (10), slugging average (.511), total bases (315) and stolen bases (18) while hitting .281. On September 8, he hit for the cycle. But the Yankees finished two games behind Detroit, in the only year between 1936 and 1943 that they lost the pennant.

In he batted .276 with 24 home runs and 87 RBI, scoring 104 runs and teaming with rookie shortstop Phil Rizzuto to lead the AL in double plays; Gordon placed seventh in the MVP vote as New York returned to the top of the standings. In the 1941 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers he played phenomenally, hitting .500 with stellar defense. In Game 1 he started the scoring with a solo home run in the second inning, had an RBI single and was walked twice (once intentionally), and turned a double play with the tying run on first base to end a 3-2 win. In Game 2, he was walked three times, once intentionally, and had three double plays in a 3-2 loss. In Game 3 he tripled, walked and had four assists, one of them to end the 2-1 win. He doubled in two runs in the ninth inning of Game 4 to give the Yankees their final 7-4 lead, four batters after Dodger catcher Mickey Owen famously dropped a third strike which would have ended the game. And he drove in another run in the final 3-1 victory in Game 5. His five double plays (three of them in Game 2) remain a record for a five-game Series. After the Series, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy said, &quot;The greatest all-around ballplayer I ever saw, and I don&#x27;t bar any of them, is Joe Gordon.&quot;
Gordon led the Yankees to another pennant in his 1942 MVP season, edging Triple Crown winner Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox for the award. He batted .322, fourth in the AL, with 18 homers and 103 RBI, and finished sixth in the league in total bases (264) and slugging (.491) while he and Rizzuto again led the league in double plays. He had another poor World Series, however, batting just .095 in the five-game loss to the St. Louis Cardinals – his only Series loss in six trips; he was picked off at second base in the bottom of the ninth in the last game. By his own lofty standards, he had a subpar yet productive season in , batting .249 with 17 home runs (5th in the AL), 69 RBI and 82 runs, and leading the AL in assists; despite his low batting mark, he was still among the league&#x27;s top ten players in both slugging (.413) and on-base percentage (.365), thanks to a career-best 98 walks (second in the AL).

In the World Series rematch with the Cardinals, he gave New York a 2–1 lead in the fourth inning of Game 1 – a 4–2 win – with a solo homer, and scored the first run in a 2–1 win in Game 4. He threw out the final batter of the Series with the tying runs on base in the 2–0 Game 5 victory, with the Yankees taking home another title. He again fielded brilliantly, setting still-standing records for a five-game Series of 20 putouts, 23 assists, 43 total chances, and a 1.000 fielding average; his 8 assists in Game 1 and 3 assists in the eighth inning of Game 5 are also records. Afterwards, he served in the U.S. Army in 1944–45 during World War II, missing those seasons.

He returned to the Yankees in 1946, which turned out to be his most challenging year in major league baseball. Gordon was spiked in an exhibition game and severed a tendon in his hand, which required surgery, and he suffered a chipped bone in his finger. As the rest of the Yankees headed to The Bronx to begin the 1946 regular season, Gordon stayed behind in Florida for a month to recover. As Gordon told &quot;Oregonian&quot; sports editor L. H. Gregory, just two weeks after returning to the Yankees lineup, Gordon tore a leg muscle. He taped the leg and resumed playing, only to tear a muscle in his other leg. Following a brief break, Gordon re-tore a leg muscle and then fractured his thumb. Gordon played in just 112 games that year and stepped up to the plate just 376 times, nearly 170 fewer at bats than his pre-war 1943 season. As a result, he batted .210 with 11 home runs and 47 RBI, much to the displeasure of new Yankees president/general manager Larry MacPhail. With Gordon-ally Joe McCarthy resigning from the Yankees club in May 1946 and following his worst season in baseball, Gordon was in trouble. Trade rumors were rampant and MacPhail even consulted Gordon teammate DiMaggio about &quot;Flash&#x27;s&quot; eventual trade for one of Cleveland&#x27;s pitchers. Taking DiMaggio&#x27;s advice, on October 11 MacPhail settled on Indians pitcher Allie Reynolds in exchange for Gordon, a move that benefited both clubs. Gordon departed New York after precisely 1,000 games and 1,000 hits: the only player in baseball history with those statistics.

===Cleveland Indians===

While Reynolds would go on to win 131 games in eight seasons for the Yankees, Gordon proved resilient and kept his new team from regretting the deal. In he returned to his old levels of production, batting .272 and leading the club with 93 RBI, and again pacing the AL in assists. His 29 homers and 279 total bases were second in the league to Williams, and his .496 slugging average trailed only Williams and DiMaggio; Gordon again finished seventh in the MVP balloting. Additionally, he played a major role in befriending teammate Larry Doby, the AL&#x27;s first black player, who had been a second baseman in the Negro leagues but became a center fielder with Cleveland. Over Doby&#x27;s first two seasons, Gordon became close to the player who was theoretically there to replace him, and Doby would later refer to him as his first friend in white baseball; however, reports that Gordon deliberately struck out in Doby&#x27;s first game to keep him from looking bad are erroneous. 1948 was even better, as Cleveland won their first AL title since 1920. Batting .280, he was second in the league to DiMaggio with 32 home runs, which remained the AL&#x27;s single-season mark for a second baseman until Bret Boone hit 36 in . He again led the team with a personal high of 124 RBIs, and was sixth in the league in slugging (.507). Gordon placed sixth in the MVP vote, won by teammate and manager Lou Boudreau. In the 1948 World Series against the Boston Braves, batting cleanup, he had a RBI single and later scored to give Cleveland a 2-1 lead in Game 2; they went on to win 4-1. In the final Game 6, he homered to give the Indians a 2-1 lead in the sixth inning, and they went on to win 4-3 to capture the championship. His seven double plays in the Series are still the record for a six-game Series. In he slipped to a .251 average, though his 20 home runs and 84 RBI were still second on the team to Doby. His major league career ended in as he hit .236 with 19 home runs and 57 RBI.

Gordon was a career .268 hitter with 253 home runs, 975 RBI, 914 runs, 1,530 hits, 264 doubles and 89 stolen bases in 1,566 games. His .466 slugging average then placed him fifth among second basemen, behind Hornsby (.577), Gehringer (.480), Lazzeri (.467) and Nap Lajoie (.466), and only Hornsby had more homers among second basemen. Gordon might have had even higher batting totals had he played in other stadiums. His first several seasons were spent in Yankee Stadium, with its immense &quot;Death Valley&quot; in left field that frustrated right-handed power hitters; during his New York years, he hit 69 home runs at home and 84 on the road. Municipal Stadium in Cleveland was also an unhelpful venue, being hostile to power hitters on both sides of the plate. Over his career, he batted 23 points higher on the road (.279) than he did at home (.256). He was selected for the All-Star team nine times, in all but his first and last seasons. He was also selected to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Major League All-Star Team in 1939–42 and 1947–48, and was runner-up to Gehringer in 1938 and to Billy Herman in 1943. In he was selected as one of the Indians&#x27; 100 greatest players.

==Later years==

Gordon next became a player-manager with the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s (PCL) Sacramento Solons in 1951–52. Showing he still had something in the tank, Gordon hit .299 with 43 home runs and 136 RBI in 148 games in 1951, but tailed off badly in 1952, hitting only .246 with just 16 home runs – his fewest since his World War II-shortened 1946 season. His teams also performed poorly under his direction, winning just over 40% of their games in those two years. Gordon then worked as a scout with the Tigers from 1953 to 1955, and as a coach during the early months of the 1956 season. In mid-year he returned to the PCL to manage the 1956–57 San Francisco Seals, winning a pennant in 1957.

He then went on to manage for four different MLB teams. Gordon began his major league managing career with the Indians in 1958, but had difficult relations with general manager Frank Lane, who publicly questioned his decisions. After Gordon announced late in 1959, with Cleveland in second place, that he would not return the next season, Lane fired him four days later. However Lane recanted and apologized after negotiations with Leo Durocher broke down and Gordon was rehired. But in the middle of the season, he was involved in a rare trade between managers, when the Indians traded him to the Tigers for their skipper Jimmy Dykes. After the season, Gordon was hired by the Kansas City Athletics for 1961. However, owner Charlie Finley fired him on June 19, replacing him with Hank Bauer, and Gordon became a scout and minor league instructor for the Los Angeles / California Angels from 1961 to 1968. In 1969, he had the distinction of managing his second team in Kansas City, this time with the expansion Royals, but lasted only one season with the club before resigning at the end of his one-year contract. Gordon later went into real estate and died of a heart attack at age 63 in Sacramento, California.

==Legacy==
On August 16, 2008, Gordon was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame. Two of Gordon&#x27;s grandchildren were present for his induction ceremony. On December 7, 2008, Gordon was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee with 10 out of 12 possible votes, 83.3%, and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 26, 2009; of the 20 candidates on two ballots, he was the only player to be selected. His only daughter, Judy Gordon of Idaho Falls, Idaho, gave his induction speech in Cooperstown in front of 21,000 people in attendance. &quot;He (Joe) insisted against having a funeral&quot;, Judy said in the closing remarks of her speech. &quot;And as such, we consider Cooperstown and the National Baseball Hall of Fame as his final resting place to be honored forever.&quot;

&quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; sports writer Russell Adams wrote a piece titled &quot;Who Is the Greatest Yankee?&quot; Adams ranked Gordon as the 9th-greatest Yankees&#x27; position player in franchise history. &quot;Gordon&#x27;s great strength was defense — his range was the best of any of the 30 candidates we studied.&quot;

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Gordon as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army Air Force during World War II.

<doc id="584907" wikidata="Q700703" url="?curid=584907" title="Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa">
<text>The Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Hayabusa&quot; (, &quot;Peregrine falcon&quot;), formal Japanese designation is a single-engine land-based tactical fighter used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service in World War II.

The Allied reporting name was &quot;Oscar&quot;, but it was often called the &quot;Army Zero&quot; by American pilots because it bore a certain resemblance to the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s counterpart to the Ki-43. Both aircraft had generally similar layout and lines, and also used essentially the same Nakajima Sakae radial engine, with similar round cowlings and bubble-type canopies (the &quot;Oscar&quot;″s being distinctly smaller and having much less framing than the A6M). While relatively easy for a trained eye to tell apart with the &quot;finer&quot; lines of the Ki-43&#x27;s fuselage – especially towards the tail – and more tapered wing planform, in the heat of battle, given the brief glimpses and distraction of combat, Allied aviators frequently made mistakes in enemy aircraft identification, reportedly having fought &quot;Zeros&quot; in areas where there were no Navy fighters.

Like the Zero, the radial-engined Ki-43 was light and easy to fly and became legendary for its combat performance in East Asia in the early years of the war. It could outmaneuver any opponent, but did not initially have armor or self-sealing fuel tanks, and its armament was poor until its final version, which was produced as late as 1945. Allied pilots often reported that the nimble Ki-43s were difficult targets but burned easily or broke apart with a few hits.

Total production amounted to 5,919 aircraft. Many of these were used during the last months of the war for kamikaze missions against the American fleet.

==Design and development==
The Ki-43 was designed by Hideo Itokawa, who would later become famous as a pioneer of Japanese rocketry. The Ki-43 prototype was produced in response to a December 1937 specification for an interceptor/escort fighter successor to the popular fixed-gear Nakajima Ki-27 &#x27;Nate&#x27;. The specification called for a top speed of , a climb rate of in five minutes and a range of . Maneuverability was to be at least as good as that of Ki-27.

When first flown in early January 1939, the Ki-43 prototype was a disappointment. Japanese test pilots complained that it was less maneuverable than the Ki-27 and not much faster. In order to solve these problems, Nakajima produced a series of progressively modified prototypes through 1939 and 1940. These changes involved a major weight saving program, a slimmer fuselage with the tail surfaces moved further aft and a new canopy. Crucially, the 11th prototype introduced the unique differential &quot;butterfly&quot; maneuvering Fowler flaps, which dramatically improved performance in tight turns. The 13th prototype combined all these changes, and tests of this aircraft resulted in an instruction for Nakajima to place the Ki-43 into production, the Ki-27 jigs being transferred to the Mansyu factory at Harbin in Japanese occupied Manchukuo.

The Ki-43 (Oscar) was initially produced in November 1939, given the designation Ki-43-I. Deliveries from Nakajima&#x27;s Ota factory commenced in February 1941. In addition to outstanding maneuverability, the Ki-43-I had an impressive rate of climb due to its light weight. Power was provided by the Nakajima Ha-25 engine turning a two-bladed, two-position variable-pitch metal propeller. Top speed was at The Ki-43 was equipped with two synchronized cowling machine guns in various configurations, with either two Type 89 machine guns, one Ho-103 machine gun and one gun, or two Ho-103 guns; the aircraft was given various sub-designations to reflect these differences. The configuration that appears to have been most prevalent at the outset of the war was the first configuration with two Type 89 machine guns, while as the war progressed the heavier combinations gained popularity and the version with the heaviest armament was sometimes given the designation Ki-43-Ic. The Ho-103 was often loaded with explosive ammunition to increase target effect; its penetrative effect against later Allied aircraft armor appears to have been marginal.
Prototypes for the Ki-43-II flew in February 1942. The Ha-25 engine was upgraded with the 2-stage supercharger, thus becoming the more powerful Nakajima Ha-115 engine, which was installed in a longer-chord cowling. The new engine turned a three-bladed propeller. The wing structure, which had suffered failures in the Ki-43-I, was strengthened and equipped with racks for drop tanks or bombs. The Ki-43-II was also fitted with a armor plate for the pilot&#x27;s head and back, and the aircraft&#x27;s fuel tanks were coated in rubber to form a crude self-sealing tank. This was later replaced by a 3-layer rubber bladder, 8mm core construction; with 2mm oil-proof lamination. The bladder proved to be highly resistant against bullets, but was not as effective against larger calibers. The pilot also enjoyed a slightly taller canopy and a reflector gunsight in place of the earlier telescopic gunsight. Nakajima commenced production of the Ki-43-II at its Ota factory in November 1942. Production was also started at the Tachikawa Aircraft Company Ltd (&quot;Tachikawa Hikoki KK&quot;) and the 1st Army Air Arsenal (&quot;Tachikawa Dai-Ichi Rikugun Kokusho&quot;), also at Tachikawa. Although Tachikawa Hikoki successfully managed to enter into large-scale production of the Ki-43, the 1st Army Air Arsenal was less successful – hampered by a shortage of skilled workers, it was ordered to stop production after 49 Ki-43s were built. Nakajima eventually ceased production in mid-1944 in favor of the Ki-84 &quot;Hayate&quot;, but the Tachikawa Hikoki continued to produce the Ki-43.

Tachikawa also produced the Ki-43-III, which utilized the more powerful Nakajima Army Type 1 Ha-115-II engine. Maximum speed increased to . Tachikawa produced 2,124 Ki-43-II and -III aircraft between April 1944 and the end of the war. Total production of all versions amounted to 5,919 aircraft.

==Operational history==

The Ki-43 was the most widely used Army fighter, and equipped 30 &quot;sentai&quot; FR (flight regiment) and 12 &quot;Dokuritsu Dai Shijugo Chutai&quot; (&quot;Direct command fighter squadron&quot; - independent squadrons not incorporated into &quot;sentai&quot;s). The first unit equipped with the Ki 43-I was the 59th FR at Hankow Airfield, during June–August 1941 and began operational sorties over Hengyang on 29 October 1941. The second unit to re-equip with the new Aircraft was the 64th FR, from August to November 1941.

The first version, Ki-43-I, entered service in 1941, the Ki-43-II in December 1942, the Ki-43-II-&quot;Kai&quot; in June 1943, and the Ki-43-IIIa in summer 1944. The aircraft fought in China, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, New Guinea, the Philippines, South Pacific islands and the Japanese home islands.

Like the Zero, the Ki-43 initially enjoyed air superiority in the skies of Malaya, Dutch East Indies, Burma and New Guinea. This was partly due to the better performance of the Oscar and partly due to the relatively small numbers of combat-ready Allied fighters, mostly the Curtiss P-36 Hawk, Curtiss P-40, Brewster Buffalo, Hawker Hurricane and Curtiss-Wright CW-21 in Asia and the Pacific during the first months of the war. As the war progressed, however, the fighter suffered from the same weaknesses as the slower, fixed-gear Ki-27 &quot;Nate&quot; predecessor to the &quot;Oscar&quot;, and the more advanced naval A6M Zero; light armor and less-than-effective self-sealing fuel tanks, which caused high casualties in combat. Its armament of two machine guns also proved inadequate against the more heavily armored Allied aircraft. As newer Allied aircraft were introduced, such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, North American P-51 Mustang, Vought F4U Corsair, Grumman F6F Hellcat, Yakovlev Yak-9, Yakovlev Yak-3U and late-model Supermarine Spitfire/Seafire, the Japanese were forced into a defensive war and most aircraft were flown by inexperienced pilots. However, even near the end, the Oscar&#x27;s excellent maneuverability could still gain advantage over rash Allied pilots.
From October to December 1944, 17 Ki-43s were shot down in air combat; their pilots claimed seven C-47s, five Consolidated B-24 Liberators, two Spitfires, two Bristol Beaufighters, two de Havilland Mosquitoes, two F4U Corsairs, two Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, one F6F Hellcat, one P-38, and one North American B-25 Mitchell. Like most Japanese combat types, many &quot;Hayabusas&quot; were at the end expended in &quot;kamikaze&quot; strikes.

The Ki-43 also served in an air defense role over Formosa, Okinawa and the Japanese home islands. Some examples were supplied to the pro-Japanese regimes of Thailand, Manchukuo and Wang Jingwei Government as well. The Thai units sometimes fought against the USAAF in southern China.

&quot;Hayabusas&quot; were well liked in the JAAF because of the pleasant flight characteristics and excellent maneuverability, and almost all JAAF fighter aces claimed victories with &quot;Hayabusas&quot; in some part of their career. At the end of the war, most &quot;Hayabusa&quot; units received Nakajima Ki-84 &quot;Hayate&quot; &quot;Frank&quot; and Kawasaki Ki-100 fighters, but some units flew the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; to the end of the war. The top-scoring &quot;Hayabusa&quot; pilot was Sergeant Satoshi Anabuki with thirty-nine confirmed victories, almost all scored with the Ki-43.

After the war, some captured examples served in limited numbers in the French Air Force in Indochina against Viet Minh rebels.

Ki-43s abandoned in the Netherlands East Indies were taken over by the newly declared Indonesian government and put into service during the fight against Dutch forces.

The music is part of the soundtrack for the 1964 film &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, and used in the film to accompany the dance known as sirtaki. It is now commonly played and danced to in Greek tavernas. The film&#x27;s track has since been recorded as a standalone song by many different musicians from around the world.

==Background==
The music of &quot;Zorba&#x27;s Dance&quot; was composed by Mikis Theodorakis, who derived it from rebetiko, a form of urban music performed by Greek musicians with Turkish makam modes. The music, and its song &quot;Strose To Stroma Sou Gia Dio&quot; (&quot;Make Your Bed for Two&quot;), was adapted from a syrtos traditional composition from Chania by the Cretan musician Giorgis Koutsourelis, which was chosen as it had &quot;energetic rhythm&quot; and some resemblance to the rebetiko. The soundtrack recording was performed on a bouzouki.

The original soundtrack credited to Mikis Theodorakis was released as a single in 1965. It was among a number of different versions performed by different artists released around the world the same year due to the success of the film. Mikis Theodorakis&#x27;s soundtrack version topped the charts in Austria and Belgium, and reached No. 5 on the Dutch Top 40 (which aggregated different versions). and No. 7 in West Germany.

The music, as with other works by Mikis Theodorakis, was banned by the Greek junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974.
===Sirtaki dance===

The dance accompanied by the music of &quot;Zorba&#x27;s Dance&quot; has been named &quot;sirtaki&quot;. It was created specifically for the film rather than a traditional form of dance. The name suggests it was created based on &quot;syrtos&quot;, a type of dance where the dancers drag their feet instead of hopping, however, the dance incorporates both a slower style hasapiko dance, and a faster one called hasaposerviko. The dance has become a popular form of Greek dance.
