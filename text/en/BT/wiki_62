<text>Jade Tree International, Inc. is an independent record label formed by Darren Walters and Tim Owen in 1990 in Wilmington, Delaware.

==History==

===Origin (1987–1990)===
In 1987, Tim Owen and Darren Walters were introduced during a punk show in Washington, D.C. 

At the time, Walters was a student at the University of Delaware where he had already independently released records on his label, Hi-Impact Records. To further these musical pursuits, Darren teamed up with Rochester Institute of Technology student Tim Owen, and his friend Carl Hedgepath. Together, they created their own label, Axtion Packed Records. 

Both Axtion Packed and Hi-Impact focused on straight edge hardcore and produced vinyl records in 45 format. 

In an effort to expand musical genres and format, Axtion Packed Records was dissolved in 1990 to form Jade Tree Records. Owens and Walters modeled their new label on established independent&#x27;s Touch &amp; Go out of Chicago and Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Dischord Records. 

===Growth and becoming established (1991–1996)===
In August of 1991, Jade Tree made their inaugural release, Culture Shock by the hardcore band Four Walls Falling. The album art included original photography by Owens. 

The new label started with many post-hardcore and noise rock bands, though these bands didn&#x27;t garner much interest from the public. It wasn&#x27;t until 1993, when Jade Tree released the album No Punches Pulled by DC area hardcore band, Swiz, did the label start receiving recognition. 

The label began incorporating emo, punk, melodic hardcore, and experimental groups into their line-up. Through college, they grew the label into a stable roster by 1995.

By 1994, Jade Tree was becoming less of a priority to the two founders. Owen had moved to New York City to attend the School Of Visual Arts to further his photography education. Walters remained in their native Delaware, where he worked in education, focusing on disadvantaged students. A newfound interest was once again sparked, when the pair heard an unreleased demo by the band Lifetime. By the fall of 1995, the band had officially signed with Jade Tree, and together they released the album Hello Bastards. This album would serve as the turning point for Jade Tree. 

In 1996, sales started to increase after the label released The Promise Ring&#x27;s &quot;30° Everywhere&quot;. The label often used the graphic designers Jason Gnewikow and Jeremy Dean for many releases.

===Middle years (1997–2008)===
Bands signed by Jade Tree have released albums which saw regular radio play, including Alkaline Trio, Pedro the Lion, Jets to Brazil, and Joan of Arc.

===Downsizing (2009–2013)===
When key distributor Touch and Go Records downsized in 2009 Jade Tree scaled down too. This led to a lessening of the frequency of new releases from the label.

===Digital release and regrowth (2014–2016)===
Jade Tree made its entire discography available for digital download and streaming on Bandcamp in June 2014. This marked a planned increase in the number of new releases.

In February 2015, the label signed the band Dogs on Acid.

===Epitaph purchase (2017–present)===

In 2017 Epitaph Records purchased Jade Tree&#x27;s entire catalog and started to re-release the back catalogue on vinyl.

<doc id="575920" wikidata="Q1635149" url="?curid=575920" title="Oncomouse">
<text>The OncoMouse or Harvard mouse is a type of laboratory mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;) that has been genetically modified using modifications designed by Philip Leder and Timothy A Stewart of Harvard University to carry a specific gene called an activated oncogene (v-Ha-ras under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter). The activated oncogene significantly increases the mouse&#x27;s susceptibility to cancer, and thus makes the mouse a suitable model for cancer research.

OncoMouse was not the first transgenic mouse to be developed for use in cancer research. Ralph L. Brinster and Richard Palmiter had developed such mice previously. However, OncoMouse was the first mammal to be patented. Because DuPont had funded Philip Leder&#x27;s research, Harvard University agreed to give DuPont exclusive rights to any inventions commercialized as a result of the funding. Patent applications on the OncoMouse were filed back in the mid-1980s in numerous countries such as in the United States, in Canada, in Europe through the European Patent Office (EPO) and in Japan. Initially the rights to the OncoMouse invention were owned by DuPont. However, in 2011 the USPTO decided that the final patent actually expired in 2005, which meant that the Oncomouse became free for use by other parties (although the name is not, as &quot;OncoMouse&quot; is a registered trademark).

The patenting of OncoMouse had a significant effect on mouse geneticists, who had previously shared their information and mice from their colonies openly. Once a strain of mice had been first described in published research, mice were stored and acquired through Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute. The patenting of OncoMouse, and the breadth of the claims made in those patents, were considered to be unreasonable by many of their contemporaries. More broadly, the patenting of OncoMouse was a first step in shifting academic research away from a culture of open and free (or very inexpensive) shared resources towards a commercial culture of expensive proprietary purchase and licensing requirements. This shift was felt far beyond the mouse genetics community. Harvard later said that it regretted the handling of the OncoMouse patents.

== Patent procedures ==
=== Canada ===
In Canada, the Supreme Court in 2002 rejected the patent in &quot;Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents)&quot;, overturning a Federal Court of Appeal verdict which ruled in favor of the patent. However, on 7 October 2003, Canadian patent 1,341,442 was granted to Harvard College. The patent was amended to omit the &quot;composition of matter&quot; claims on the transgenic mice. The Supreme Court had rejected the entire patent application on the basis of these claims, but Canadian patent law allowed the amended claims to grant under rules that predated the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the patent was valid until 2020.

=== Europe (through the EPO) ===
European patent application 85304490.7 was filed in June 1985 by &quot;The President and Fellows of Harvard College&quot;. It was initially refused in 1989 by an Examining Division of the European Patent Office (EPO) among other things on the grounds that the European Patent Convention (EPC) excludes patentability of animals per se. The decision was appealed and the Board of Appeal held that &quot;animal varieties&quot; were excluded of patentability by the EPC (and especially its ), while &quot;animals&quot; (as such) were not excluded from patentability. The Examining Division then granted the patent in 1992 (its publication number is ).

The European patent was then opposed by several third parties, more precisely by 17 opponents, notably on the grounds laid out in , according to which &quot;inventions, the publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to &quot;ordre public&quot; or morality are excluded from patentability. After oral proceedings took place in November 2001, the patent was maintained in amended form. This decision was then appealed and the appeal decision was taken on July 6, 2004. The case was eventually remitted to the first instance, i.e. the Opposition Division, with the order to maintain the patent on a newly amended form. However, revocation of the patent was eventually published on August 16, 2006, more than 20 years after the filing date (the normal term of a European patent under ), for failure to pay the fees and to file the translations of the amended claims under .

=== United States ===
In 1988, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted (filed Jun 22, 1984, issued Apr 12, 1988, expired April 12, 2005) to Harvard College claiming &quot;a transgenic non-human mammal whose germ cells and somatic cells contain a recombinant activated oncogene sequence introduced into said mammal...&quot; The claim explicitly excluded humans, apparently reflecting moral and legal concerns about patents on human beings, and about modification of the human genome. Remarkably, there were no US courts called to decide on the validity of this patent. Two separate patents were issued to Harvard College covering methods for providing a cell culture from a transgenic non-human animal (; filed Mar 22, 1988, issued Feb 11, 1992, expired Feb 11, 2009) and testing methods using transgenic mice expressing an oncogene (; filed Sep 19, 1991, issued Jul 20, 1999, expires July 20, 2016). Both these patents were found to expire in 2005 by the USPTO due to a terminal disclaimer. Dupont is currently bringing suit in the Eastern District of Virginia.

<text>Core rope memory is a form of read-only memory (ROM) for computers. It was used in the UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer I) and the UNIVAC II, developed by the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in the 1950s, as it was a popular technology for program and data storage in that era. It was later used in the 1960s by early NASA Mars space probes and then in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), which was built by Raytheon.

The software for the AGC was written by programmers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Instrumentation Lab, and was woven into core rope memory by female workers in factories. Some programmers nicknamed the finished product &quot;LOL memory&quot;, for &quot;Little Old Lady&quot; memory.

== Operation ==
Similar to magnetic-core memory, magnetic rings (or cores) are used to determine the data of the software. Unlike magnetic-core memory, the cores themselves are not used to store the data; the way a core is wired controls whether that core represents a &#x27;0&#x27; or a &#x27;1&#x27;.

There are three main types of functions a wire can have in core rope memory:

* Set/reset: These are used to change all of the cores from one polarity to another.
* Sense: A sense wire can detect a change in a core&#x27;s polarity. It can pass through a core to indicate one bit state (typically &#x27;1&#x27;) or bypass it to represent the other (typically &#x27;0&#x27;).
* Inhibit: Inhibit wires are used effectively to address which core to select.

To read from core rope memory, the set/reset wire is given a strong current to change the polarity of the cores. This induces a small voltage on the sense wires passing through them, which can then be used to interpret binary data. The inhibit wires pass a current in the opposite direction of the set/reset wire for all cores but the desired one, acting like a memory addressing system. This prevents the sense wires from detecting polarity changes from the other magnetic cores.

The sense wires are used to encode the data by either going through a core or bypassing it. By using many sense wires, multiple bits of data can be stored for each core. In the case of the Apollo Guidance Computer, each core had 192 sense wires passing through it, which could store 12 16-bit words per core.

==Memory density==

By the standards of the time, a relatively large amount of data could be stored in a small installed volume of core rope memory: 72 kilobytes per cubic foot, or roughly 2.5 megabytes per cubic meter. This was about 18 times the amount of magnetic-core memory (within two cubic feet).

<text>Francisco de Asís Tárrega y Eixea (21 November 185215 December 1909) was a Spanish composer and classical guitarist of the late Romantic period. He is known for such pieces as &quot;Capricho Árabe&quot; and &quot;Recuerdos de la Alhambra&quot;.

==Biography==
Tárrega was born on 21 November 1852, in Villarreal, Province of Castellón, Spain. It is said that Francisco&#x27;s father played flamenco and several other music styles on his guitar; when his father was away working as a watchman at the Convent of San Pascual, Francisco would take his father&#x27;s guitar and attempt to make the beautiful sounds he had heard. Francisco&#x27;s nickname as a child was &quot;Quiquet&quot;.

As a child, he ran away from his nanny and fell into an irrigation channel and injured his eyes. Fearing that his son might lose his sight completely, his father moved the family to Castellón de la Plana to attend music classes because as a musician he would be able to earn a living, even if blind. Both his first music teachers, Eugeni Ruiz and Manuel González, were blind.

In 1862, concert guitarist Julián Arcas, on tour in Castellón, heard the young Tárrega play and advised Tárrega&#x27;s father to allow Francisco to come to Barcelona to study with him. Tárrega&#x27;s father agreed, but insisted that his son take piano lessons as well. The guitar was viewed as an instrument to accompany singers, while the piano was quite popular throughout Europe. However, Tárrega had to stop his lessons shortly after, when Arcas left for a concert tour abroad. Although Tárrega was only ten years old, he ran away and tried to start a musical career on his own by playing in coffee houses and restaurants in Barcelona. He was soon found and brought back to his father, who had to make great sacrifices to advance his son&#x27;s musical education.

Three years later, in 1865, he ran away again, this time to Valencia where he joined a Romani family. His father looked for him and brought him back home once more, but he ran away a third time, again to Valencia. By his early teens, Tárrega was proficient on both the piano and the guitar. For a time, he played with other musicians at local engagements to earn money, but eventually he returned home to help his family.

Tárrega entered the Madrid Royal Conservatory in 1874, under the sponsorship of a wealthy merchant named Antonio Canesa. He had brought along with him a recently purchased guitar, made in Seville by Antonio de Torres. Its superior sonic qualities inspired him both in his playing and in his view of the instrument&#x27;s compositional potential. At the conservatory, Tárrega studied composition under Emilio Arrieta who convinced him to focus on guitar and abandon the idea of a career with the piano.

By the end of the 1870s, Tárrega was teaching the guitar (Emilio Pujol, Miguel Llobet, and Daniel Fortea were pupils of his) and giving regular concerts. Tárrega received much acclaim for his playing and began traveling to other areas of Spain to perform. By this time he was composing his first works for guitar, which he played in addition to works of other composers.

During the winter of 1880, Tárrega replaced his friend Luis de Soria, in a concert in Novelda, Alicante, where, after the concert, an important man in town asked the artist to listen to his daughter, María José Rizo, who was learning to play guitar. Soon they were engaged.

In 1881, Tárrega played in the Opera Theatre in Lyon and then the Paris Odeon, in the bicentenary of the death of Pedro Calderón de la Barca. He also played in London, where he liked neither the language nor the weather. There is a story about his visit to England: after a concert, some people saw that the musician was in low spirits. &quot;What is the matter, maestro?&quot; they asked him. &quot;Do you miss home? Your family, perhaps?&quot; They advised him to capture that moment of sadness in his music. Thus he conceived the theme of one of his most memorable works, &quot;Lágrima&quot; (teardrop). After playing in London he returned to Novelda for his wedding. At Christmas 1882, Tárrega married María José Rizo.
To enlarge his guitar repertory and to make use of his considerable knowledge of keyboard music, he soon began transcribing piano works of Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn and others. Tárrega and his wife moved to Madrid, gaining their living by teaching privately and playing concerts, but after the death of an infant daughter during the winter, Maria Josefa de los Angeles Tárrega Rizo, they settled permanently in Barcelona in 1885. Among his friends in Barcelona were Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, Joaquín Turina and Pau Casals.
Francisco Tárrega and María José (María Josefa) Rizo had three more children: Paquito (Francisco), Maria Rosatia (María Rosalia) (best known as Marieta) and Concepción. On a concert tour in Valencia shortly afterward, Tárrega met the wealthy Concepción Gómez de Jacoby, who became a valuable patron to him. She allowed him and his family use of part of her house outside Barcelona. Later she took him to Granada, which later inspired the guitarist to write &quot;Recuerdos de la Alhambra&quot;, which he first dedicated to Concepción in 1899 with the title &quot;A Granada.&quot; He later dedicated a revised published version of this piece to Alfred Cottin, the French guitarist he had met in Paris while participating in a concert on a visit accompanied and almost certainly sponsored by Gómez de Jacoby.

From the later 1880s up to 1903, Tárrega continued composing and traveling, but limited his concerts to Spain. In 1900, Tárrega visited Algiers, where he was said to have heard a repetitive rhythm played on an Arabian drum and the following morning composed &quot;Danza Mora&quot; based on that rhythm. In about 1902, he cut his fingernails and created a sound that would become typical of those guitarists later associated with his school. The following year he went on tour to Italy, performing in Rome, Naples, and Milan.

In January 1906, he was afflicted with paralysis on his right side, and though he would eventually return to performing, he never completely recovered. He finished his last work, &quot;Oremus&quot;, on 2 December 1909. He died in Barcelona thirteen days later, on 15 December, at the age of 57.

==Musical style and influence==

Tárrega composed music in the romantic style of 19th-century European masters. His conservatory training and familiarity with contemporary classical genres and techniques are apparent in his compositions and transcriptions; these are more sophisticated than those of Spanish guitarist-composers of the previous generation and his contemporaries, e.g., Magín Alegre, Tomás Damas, Julián Arcas, José Viñas, and José Ferrer.

A virtuoso on his instrument, he was known as the &quot;Sarasate of the guitar,&quot; although Tárrega preferred small intimate performances over the concert stage.

Tárrega is considered to have laid the foundations for 20th-century classical guitar and for increasing interest in the guitar as a recital instrument. One of his late students, Josefina Robledo Gallego, promoted Tárrega&#x27;s style on her concert tours to South America and is credited with &quot;becoming the main disseminator of the Tàrrega school in Brazil.&quot;

== Compositions ==
Although only 19 original compositions were published in his lifetime, Francisco Tárrega composed approximately 80 original pieces and 120 transcriptions – mostly for his own use and that of his students. Most of his later published works were edited by others, and often altered. His favored genres were character pieces (several with Spanish, Moorish and Arabic allusions) including preludes, etudes, caprices, serenades, and dances.

He transcribed many works from the piano (he was a capable keyboard player), violin and the operatic repertory. 
As with several of his Spanish contemporaries, such as his friend Isaac Albéniz, he had an interest in combining the prevailing romantic style in classical music with Spanish folk elements, and transcribed several of Albéniz&#x27;s piano pieces. 

He is also the composer of &quot;Gran Vals&quot;, an excerpt of which was used in the Nokia tune, the default ringtone of Nokia phones. It appears on these phones in a variety of different styles and instrumentations; for example, phones from 2002 to 2007 include piano-based renditions, while phones released during 2008 to 2010 feature a folk-inspired guitar rendition.

In 2015, the Italian violist Marco Misciagna published his arrangements for solo viola of the Tango, Capricho árabe and Recuerdos de la Alhambra.

==Guitars==
The guitars used by Tárrega include:
* Enrique Garcia, n°74 (1906) - This instrument was gifted by Tárrega to his friend Alfred Cottin, to whom he dedicated the composition Recuerdos de la Alhambra. It then became the official guitar of &#x27;Les Amis de la Guitare&#x27;, a circle of Parisian guitarists, where it was played by Django Reinhardt, among others. In 2019 Kyuhee Park recorded a video of Recuerdos de la Alhambra on this guitar. (See External Link)
*Torres, FE 17 (1869) – This is the guitar that was given to 17 year old Francisco Tárrega by Torres personally after hearing him play.
*Torres, SE 49 (1883)
*Torres, SE 114 (1888); in the collection of Sheldon Urlik

<doc id="575927" wikidata="Q271517" url="?curid=575927" title="Nicholas Murray Butler">
<text>Nicholas Murray Butler (April 2, 1862 – December 7, 1947) was an American philosopher, diplomat, and educator. Butler was president of Columbia University, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, and the late James S. Sherman&#x27;s replacement as William Howard Taft’s running mate in the 1912 United States presidential election. &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed his Christmas greeting to the nation for many years during the 1920s and 1930s.

==Early life and education==

Butler, great-grandson of Morgan John Rhys, was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Mary Butler and manufacturing worker Henry Butler. He enrolled in Columbia College (later Columbia University) and joined the Peithologian Society. He earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1882, his master&#x27;s degree in 1883 and his doctorate in 1884. Butler&#x27;s academic and other achievements led Theodore Roosevelt to call him &quot;Nicholas Miraculous&quot;. In 1885, Butler studied in Paris and Berlin and became a lifelong friend of future Secretary of State Elihu Root. Through Root he also met Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. In the fall of 1885, Butler joined the staff of Columbia&#x27;s philosophy department.

In 1887, he co-founded with Grace Hoadley Dodge, and became president of, the New York School for the Training of Teachers, which later affiliated with Columbia University and was renamed Teachers College, Columbia University, and from which a co-educational experimental and developmental unit became Horace Mann School. From 1890 to 1891, Butler was a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Throughout the 1890s, Butler served on the New Jersey Board of Education and helped form the College Entrance Examination Board. During the 1890s Butler edited The Great Educators book series for Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons.

==Presidency of Columbia University==

In 1901, Butler became acting president of Columbia University and, in 1902, formally became president. Among the many dignitaries in attendance at his investiture was President Roosevelt. Butler was president of Columbia for 43 years, the longest tenure in the university&#x27;s history, retiring in 1945. As president, Butler carried out a major expansion of the campus, adding many new buildings, schools, and departments. These additions included Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, the first academic medical center in the world.

In 1919, Butler amended the admissions process to Columbia in order to limit the number of Jewish students (it became the first American institution of higher learning to establish an anti-Jewish quota). Butler&#x27;s policy was successful and the number of students hailing from New York City dropped from 54% to 23% stemming &quot;the invasion of the Jewish student&quot;. This is one of the reasons why Butler has been called an anti-semite.

In September 1931, Butler told the freshman class at Columbia that totalitarian systems produced &quot;men of far greater intelligence, far stronger character, and far more courage than the system of elections.&quot;

In 1937, he was admitted as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

In 1941, the Pulitzer Prize fiction jury selected Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. The Pulitzer Board initially agreed with that judgment, but Butler, &quot;ex officio&quot; head of the Pulitzer board, found the novel offensive and persuaded the board to reverse its determination, so that no novel received the prize that year.

During his lifetime, Columbia named its philosophy library for him; after he died, its main academic library, previously known as South Hall, was rechristened Butler Library. A faculty apartment building on 119th Street and Morningside Drive was also renamed in Butler&#x27;s honor, as was a major prize in philosophy.

A polemical attack on Butler&#x27;s time at Columbia University appeared in &quot;The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education&quot;, by Upton Sinclair.

==Political activity==

Butler was a delegate to each Republican National Convention from 1888 to 1936; when Vice President James S. Sherman died six days before the 1912 United States presidential election, Butler was designated to receive the electoral votes that Sherman would have received: the Republican ticket won only 8 electoral votes from Utah and Vermont, finishing third behind the Democrats and the Progressives. Butler tried to secure the 1916 Republican presidential nomination for Elihu Root. Butler also sought the nomination for himself in 1920, without success.

Butler believed that Prohibition was a mistake, with negative effects on the country. He was active in the successful effort for Repeal Prohibition in 1933.

He credited John W. Burgess along with Alexander Hamilton for providing the philosophical basis of his Republican principles.

In June 1936, Butler traveled to the Carnegie Endowment Peace Conference in London where, at the meeting, fundamental problems of money and finance were explored.

=== Attitude towards Fascism and Nazism ===
According to historian Stephen H. Norwood, Butler failed to &quot;grasp the nature and implications of Nazism... influenced both by his antisemitism, privately expressed, and his economic conservatism and hostility to trade unionism.&quot; Butler was a longtime admirer of Benito Mussolini. He compared the Italian Fascist leader to Oliver Cromwell and, in the 1920s, he noted &quot;the stupendous improvement which Fascism has brought&quot;.

In November 1933, months after the Nazi book burnings began, he welcomed Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States, to Columbia and refused to appear with a notable German dissident when the latter visited the university. Butler was criticized for his &quot;remarkable silence&quot; and complicity towards Hitler&#x27;s regime until the late 1930s.
==Internationalist==

From 1907 to 1912, Butler was the chair of the Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration. Butler was also instrumental in persuading Andrew Carnegie to provide the initial $10 million funding for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Butler became head of international education and communication, founded the European branch of the Endowment headquartered in Paris, and was President of the Endowment from 1925 to 1945. For his work in this field, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for 1931 (shared with Jane Addams) &quot;[For his promotion] of the Kellogg-Briand pact&quot; and for his work as the &quot;leader of the more establishment-oriented part of the American peace movement&quot;.

In December 1916, Butler, Roosevelt and other philanthropists, including Scottish-born industrialist John C. Moffat, William Astor Chanler, Joseph Choate, Clarence Mackay, George von Lengerke Meyer, and John Grier Hibben, purchased the Château de Chavaniac, birthplace of the Marquis de Lafayette in Auvergne, to serve as a headquarters for the French Heroes Lafayette Memorial Fund, which was managed by Chanler&#x27;s ex-wife, Beatrice Ashley Chanler.

Butler was President of the Pilgrims Society, which promotes Anglo-American friendship. He served as President of the Pilgrims from 1928 to 1946. Butler was president of The American Academy of Arts and Letters from 1928 to 1941 and was an early member of the academy.

==Personal life==
Butler married Susanna Edwards Schuyler (1863–1903) in 1887 and had one daughter from that marriage. Susanna was the daughter of Jacob Rutsen Schuyler (1816–1887) and Susannah Haigh Edwards (born 1830). His wife died in 1903 and he married again in 1907 to Kate La Montagne, granddaughter of New York property developer Thomas E. Davis.

In 1940, Butler completed his autobiography with the publication of the second volume of &quot;Across the Busy Years&quot;.

Butler became almost completely blind in 1945 at age 83. He resigned from the posts he held and died two years later. He is interred at Cedar Lawn Cemetery, in Paterson, New Jersey.

Butler was not universally liked. In 1939, a former student of Butler, Rolfe Humphries, published in the pages of &quot;Poetry&quot; an effort titled &quot;Draft Ode for a Phi Beta Kappa Occasion&quot; that followed a classical format of unrhymed blank verse in iambic pentameter with one classical reference per line. The first letters of each line of the resulting acrostic spelled out the message: &quot;Nicholas Murray Butler is a horses [sic] ass&quot;. Upon discovering the &quot;hidden&quot; message, the irate editors ran a formal apology. Randolph Bourne lampooned Butler as &quot;Alexander Macintosh Butcher&quot; in &quot;One of our Conquerors&quot;, a 1915 essay he published in &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

Butler wrote and spoke voluminously on all manner of subjects ranging from education to world peace. Although marked by erudition and great learning, his work tended toward the portentous and overblown. In &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, the critic Dorothy Dunbar Bromley referred to Butler&#x27;s pronouncements as &quot;those interminable miasmas of guff&quot;.

<doc id="575943" wikidata="Q1614966" url="?curid=575943" title="Robert Taft Jr.">
<text>Robert Alphonso Taft Jr. (February 26, 1917 – December 7, 1993) was an American politician. He was a member of the Taft family who served as a Republican Representative from Ohio between 1963 and 1965, as well as between 1967 and 1971. Taft also served as a U.S. Senator between 1971 and 1976.

==Early life==
Robert Alphonso Taft Jr. was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on February 26, 1917, the second of four sons born to Robert Alphonso Taft Sr. and the former Martha Wheaton Bowers. Robert Jr.&#x27;s paternal grandparents were President William Howard Taft and First Lady Helen Louise &quot;Nellie&quot; Herron while his maternal grandparents were Lloyd Wheaton Bowers (Solicitor General of the United States from 1909 to 1910) and Louisa Bennett Wilson. His older brother was William Howard Taft III, who served as Ambassador to Ireland from 1953 to 1957, while his younger brothers were Lloyd Bowers Taft, who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati, and Horace Dwight Taft, who became a professor of physics and dean at Yale. Taft graduated from Yale University in 1939 and Harvard Law School in 1942.

==Career==
During World War II, Taft served as an officer in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946. After law school, Taft joined the Cincinnati law firm, Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister, which had been founded by his father. Taft served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1955 to 1962 until winning election to the United States House of Representatives. Taft won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1962 as an at-large representative from Ohio (at-large seats were barred by the Voting Rights Act).

In 1955 he became a compatriot of the Sons of the American Revolution.

In 1964, rather than running for re-election to the House, he ran for the U.S. Senate, but he lost to Stephen M. Young. In 1966, Taft returned to the House of Representatives, unseating Democratic incumbent (and future Governor of Ohio) John J. Gilligan. In 1968, Taft won re-election, defeating Democrat Carl F. Heiser. Taft then won Young&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat six years after losing to him when Young did not run for re-election, running against Howard Metzenbaum. Taft, however, lost six years later in a rematch against Metzenbaum. He resigned six days before the end of his term to resume the practice of law.

==Personal life==
In 1939, Robert Jr. married Blanca Duncan Noel (1917–1968), daughter of Lewis W. Noel and Natalie Duncan. They were the parents of:
*Robert Alphonso &quot;Bob&quot; Taft III (born 1942), Governor of Ohio from 1999 to 2007
*Sarah Butler Taft
*Deborah Taft
*Jonathan Duncan Taft.
After Blanca&#x27;s death, Robert Jr. remarried to Katherine Longworth Whittaker, widow of his distant cousin David Gibson Taft. They divorced in 1977 and in October 1978, he married the former Joan McKelvy, also of Cincinnati.

On November 29, 1993, Taft suffered a stroke and fell into a coma. He never woke from the coma and died on December 7, 1993. Joan died on January 16, 2015.

The station receives its name from the nearby Balderas street, which in turn was named in honor of Lucas Balderas, a Mexican military officer that participated in the Mexican–American War and was killed at the Battle of Molino del Rey in 1847. It is said that his last words were &quot;poor country of mine&quot;.

The station pictogram depicts the colonial-era cannon preserved on the nearby Plaza de La Ciudadela. The cannon is a reminder of the Ten Tragic Days, which was a period a little bit longer than 10 days in which a coup the democratically elected government of Francisco I. Madero took place. This chapter would end with the murder of President Madero and Vice-President José María Pino Suárez, as well as the rise to the presidency of Victoriano Huerta.

==General information==
Nearby Metro Balderas are some interesting places, like La Ciudadela market, filled with Mexican handicrafts, the José Vasconcelos Central Library of Mexico City, and facilities of broadcaster Televisa. Next to the library lies a &quot;tianguis&quot; (street market) full of books old and new, comics, collectibles, etc.

This station has an information desk and facilities for the disabled. It also displays a plaque unveiled on 19 September 2004, celebrating Mexican rock musician Rockdrigo González, killed exactly 19 years earlier in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake and composer of a song titled &quot;Metro Balderas&quot;. In September 2011 a real-size bronze statue of Rockdrigo was also unveiled inside the station.

Although this station is totally underground, cellular phone signals (GSM and TDMA for several providers) are able to reach the platform. The station also has charging stations for mobile devices.

==History==
Metro Balderas was opened on 4 September 1969, as part of the first stage of Line 1, going from Chapultepec to Zaragoza.

The station became the network&#x27;s second transfer station, when the first stretch of Line 3, from Tlatelolco to Hospital General, was opened in November 1970.

===Incidents===
On Friday, 18 September 2009 a mass shooting occurred on the platform. A man was tagging one of the station walls with a marker, therefore, he was confronted by a police officer. He reacted by taking out a gun and killing the officer and a construction worker who tried to disarm him, he also left five more wounded. The man later claimed that he committed the killings &quot;in the name of God&quot; and was sentenced to 151 years in prison.

The man who tried to disarm him was Esteban Cervantes Barrera.

On 29 December 2018, a woman gave birth to a child inside the station, at the Line 1 platforms, helped by personnel of the Mexican Red Cross.

<text>The National Security Service (, MEH, but known as MAH) was the governmental intelligence organization of Turkey between 1926 and 1965, when it was replaced by the National Intelligence Organization (, MİT).
It was established at a time when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was purging Committee of Union and Progress elements, including the Karakol society and Teşkilât-ı Mahsûsa (&quot;Special Organization&quot;) intelligence organizations. The first director of the MAH was Şükrü Âli Ögel (1886–1973).

During World War II, Turkey saw increased espionage by British, Soviet, and German operatives and sympathizers. The MAH learned that Nazi Germany would not attempt to invade Turkey, allowing the İnönü administration to resist mounting Allied pressure to declare war on Germany.

The MAH received financial support from the CIA.

== Notes ==
* The early Turkish government named the organization MAH, without expanding the acronym, so unauthorized persons would not be able to guess what the organization was responsible for. This gave rise to incorrect backronyms such as &quot;Millî Amale Hizmeti&quot; and &quot;Millî Asayiş Hizmeti&quot;.

<text>Pierre Edouard Leopold Verger, alias Fatumbi or Fátúmbí (4 November 1902, in Paris – 11 February 1996, in Salvador, Brazil) was a photographer, self-taught ethnographer, and &quot;babalawo&quot; (Yoruba priest of Ifà) who devoted most of his life to the study of the African diaspora — the slave trade, the African-based religions of the new world, and the resulting cultural and economical flows from and to Africa.

==Life==
At the age of 30, after losing his family, Pierre Verger took up the career of journalistic photographer. Over the next 15 years, he traveled the four continents, documenting many civilizations that would soon be effaced by progress. His destinations included Tahiti (1933); United States, Japan, and China (1934 and 1937); Italy, Spain, Sudan (now Mali), Niger, Upper Volta, Togo and Dahomey (now Benin, 1935); the West Indies (1936); Mexico (1937, 1939, and 1957); the Philippines and Indochina (now Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, 1938); Guatemala and Ecuador (1939); Senegal (as a conscript, 1940); Argentina (1941), Peru and Bolivia (1942 and 1946); and finally Brazil (1946). His photographs were featured in magazines such as &quot;Paris-Soir&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; (under the pseudonym of &quot;Mr. Lensman&quot;), &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Paris Match&quot;, and in 1955 his graphic composition of three women bearing vases of flowers on turbaned heads was selected by curator Edward Steichen for MoMA&#x27;s 1955 world-touring &quot;The Family of Man&quot; exhibition, seen by 9 million visitors. 

In the city of Salvador, Brazil he fell in love with the place and people, and decided to stay for good. Having become interested in the local history and culture, he turned from errant photographer to a researcher of the African diaspora in the Americas. His subsequent voyages are focused on that goal: the west coast of Africa and Paramaribo (1948), Haiti (1949), and Cuba (1957). After studying the Yoruba culture and its influences in Brazil, Verger became an initiate of the Candomblé religion, and officiated at its rituals. During a visit to Benin, he was initiated into Ifá (&quot;ikin&quot; divination), became a &quot;babalawo&quot; (priest) of Orunmila, and was renamed &quot;Fátúmbí&quot; (&quot;he who is reborn through the Ifá oracle&quot;).

Veger&#x27;s contributions to ethnography are embodied in dozens of conference papers, journal articles and books, and were recognized by Sorbonne University, which conferred upon him a doctoral degree (&quot;Docteur 3eme Cycle&quot;) in 1966 — quite a feat for someone who dropped out of high school at 17.

Verger continued to study and document his chosen subject right until his death in Salvador, at the age of 93. During that time he became a professor at the Federal University of Bahia in 1973, where he was responsible for the establishment of the Afro-Brazilian Museum in Salvador; and served as visiting professor at the University of Ifé in Nigeria. The non-profit in Salvador, which he established to continue his work, holds more than 63,000 photos and negatives taken until 1973, as well as his papers and correspondence.

His life has been documented in a book by Jérôme Souty and a movie.

<doc id="575953" wikidata="Q17098559" url="?curid=575953" title="Penciller">
<text>A penciller (or penciler) is an artist who works on the creation of comic books, graphic novels, and similar visual art forms, with a focus on the initial pencil illustrations, usually in collaboration with other artists, who provide inks, colors and lettering in the book, under the supervision of an editor.

In the American comic book industry, the penciller is the first step in rendering the story in visual form, and may require several steps of feedback with the writer. These artists are concerned with layout (positions and vantages on scenes) to showcase steps in the plot.

==Tools and materials==
A penciller works in pencil. Beyond this basic description, however, different artists choose to use a wide variety of different tools. While many artists use traditional wood pencils, others prefer mechanical pencils or drafting leads. Pencillers may use any lead hardness they wish, although many artists use a harder lead (like a 2H) to make light lines for initial sketches, then turn to a slightly softer lead (like a HB) for finishing phases of the drawing. Still other artists do their initial layouts using a light-blue colored pencil because that color tends to disappear during photocopying.

Most US comic book pages are drawn oversized on large sheets of paper, usually Bristol board. The customary size of comic book pages in the mainstream American comics industry is 11 by 17 inches. The inker usually works directly over the penciller&#x27;s pencil marks, though occasionally pages are inked on translucent paper, such as drafting vellum, preserving the original pencils. The artwork is later photographically reduced in size during the printing process. With the advent of digital illustration programs such as Photoshop, more and more artwork is produced digitally, either in part or entirely (see below).

==Notable creators and their techniques==

=== Jack Kirby ===
From 1949 until his retirement, Jack Kirby worked out of a ten-foot-wide basement studio dubbed &quot;The Dungeon&quot; by his family. When starting with a clean piece of Bristol board, he would first draw his panel lines with a T-square.

=== Arthur Adams ===
Arthur Adams begins drawing thumbnail layouts from the script he is given, either at home or in a public place. The thumbnails range in size from 2 inches x 3 inches to half the size of the printed comic book. He or an assistant will then enlarge the thumbnails and trace them onto illustration board with a non-photo blue pencil, sometimes using a Prismacolor light-blue pencil, because it is not too waxy, and erases easily. When working on the final illustration board, he does so on a large drawing board when in his basement studio, and a lapboard when sitting on his living room couch. After tracing the thumbnails, he will then clarify details with another light-blue pencil, and finalize the details with a Number 2 pencil. He drew the first three chapters of &quot;Jonni Future&quot; at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, &quot;The Garden of the Sklin&quot;, at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. For a large poster image with a multitude of characters, he will go over the figure outlines with a marker in order to emphasize them. He will use photographic reference when appropriate, as when he draws things that he is not accustomed to. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.

=== Jim Lee ===
Jim Lee is known to use F lead for his pencil work.

=== J. Scott Campbell ===
J. Scott Campbell does his pencil with a lead holder, and Sanford Turquoise H lead, which he uses for its softness and darkness, and for its ability to provide a &quot;sketchy&quot; feel, with a minimal amount of powdery lead smearing. He uses this lead because it strikes a balance between too hard, and therefore not dark enough on the page, and too soft, and therefore prone to smearing and crumbling. Campbell avoids its closest competitor because he finds it too waxy. Campbell has also used HB lead and F lead. He maintains sharpness of the lead with a Berol Turquoise sharpener, changing them every four to six months, which he finds is the duration of their grinding ability. Campbell uses a combination of Magic Rub erasers, eraser sticks, and since he began to ink his work digitally, a Sakura electric eraser. He often sharpens the eraser to a cornered edge in order to render fine detailed work.

=== Travis Charest ===
Travis Charest uses mainly 2H lead to avoid smearing, and sometimes HB lead. He previously illustrated on regular illustration board provided by publishers, though he disliked the non-photo blue lines printed on them. By 2000, he switched to Crescent board for all his work, because it does not warp when wet, produces sharper illustrations, and are more suitable for framing because they lack the non-photo blue lines. Charest usually prefers not to employ preliminary sketching practices, such as layouts, thumbnails or lightboxing, in part due to impatience, and in part because he enjoys the serendipitous nature in which artwork develops when produced with greater spontaneity. He also prefers to use reference only when rendering objects that require a degree of real-life accuracy, such as guns, vehicles, or characters of licensed properties that must resemble actors with whom they are closely identified, as when he illustrated the cover to &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation: Embrace the Wolf&quot; in 2000.

=== Adam Hughes ===
The penciling process that artist Adam Hughes employs for his cover work is the same he uses when doing sketches for fans at conventions, with the main difference being that he does cover work in his sketchbook, before transferring the drawing to virgin art board with a lightbox, whereas he does convention drawings on 11 x 14 Strathmore bristol, as he prefers penciling on the rougher, vellum surface rather than smooth paper, preferring smoother paper only for brush inking. He does preliminary undersketches with a lead holder, because he feels regular pencils get worn down to the nub too quickly. As he explained during a sketch demonstration at a comic book convention, during this process he uses a Sanford Turquoise 4B lead, a soft lead, though when working at home in Atlanta, where the humid weather tends to dampen the paper, he sometimes uses a B lead or 2B lead, which acts like a 4B in that environment. However, his website explains that he uses 6B lead, with some variation. For pieces rendered entirely in pencil, he employs a variety of pencil leads of varying degrees of hardness. After darkening in the construction lines that he wishes to keep, he erases the lighter ones with a kneaded eraser before rendering greater detail. For more detailed erasures, he uses a pencil-shaped white eraser, and to erase large areas, he uses a larger, hand-held white eraser, the Staedtler Mars plastic, which he calls a &quot;thermonuclear eraser&quot;, because it &quot;takes care of everything&quot;.

=== Joe Quesada ===
Artist and former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada begins with sketches much smaller than the actual size at which he will render the final drawing. He employs a Cintiq drawing tablet when he desires to do a &quot;tighter&quot; digital layout of an illustration. When sketching figures, he will sometimes use photographic reference, and incorporate the photos directly into his sketches during the process of finalizing a layout. Once he makes a final decision on a layout, he will then print it out at full size, and use a light box to pencil it, sometimes altering elements in the design such as lighting or other details.

=== Bryan Hitch ===
Bryan Hitch begins with multiple rough sketches employing different camera angles on paper with a blue pencil, which traditionally does not photocopy or scan, and then selects the desired elements from the rough sketch with a graphite pencil. After picking the initial shapes, he will further emphasize his selections with colored pens, continuing to attempt different variations. He will then, depending on how late in the day it is, either redraw the illustration on a sheet of layout paper or use his lightbox to tighten and clean up the drawing, emphasizing that the lightbox should not be a mere exercise in tracing, but an opportunity to refine or change elements in the drawing to make it &quot;clean&quot; enough to be inked. 

When Hitch transfers the drawing to the final art board, he does initial layouts with a 2H pencil, which he feels provides the necessary accuracy and detail, and uses an erasable blue pencil to mark panel frames and vanishing points, which he introduces after the rough stage. He chooses not to put too much time or polish into this stage, preferring to work quickly, lightly and instinctively. He uses a mechanical pencil with 0.9mm 2H lead at this stage for fine outlines and detail work, and a traditional pencil for more organic work, including softer lines, shading large areas and creating more fluid motion. The &quot;best tool of all&quot;, according to him, is a traditional pencil cut with a craft knife, which he says can produce a variety of marks, and be used for detail, shading and general sketching. Hitch believes the best results combine both the mechanical and the knife-sharpened traditional pencil. 

Hitch is particular about his studio workspace, which does not contain a TV or sofa, stating that such things belong in the lounge for relaxation. Despite using a professional drawing board, he emphasizes that any inexpensive board large enough to hold the paper is sufficient, as he mostly uses a piece of roughly cut chip-board leaning on the edge of his desk. He uses an Apple iMac desktop computer, flatbed scanner and Photoshop to modify his artwork digitally.

=== Simone Bianchi ===
In contrast to Hitch&#x27;s work environment, artist Simone Bianchi says that he cannot work unless he is listening to music, which he does via stereo speakers placed above his drawing board, and an extensive music collection in his studio. Bianchi uses extensive photo reference and a lightbox to give his artwork a realistic look. He uses a wooden drawing board that he used to draw on flat, but angled it due to back pain that he began having in 2006.

=== Marc Silvestri ===
Another artist who listens to music while working is Marc Silvestri, who says that he listens to down-tempo chill music while working, in contrast to the alternative rock he listens to at other times.

=== Erik Larsen ===
On the Biography &amp; Bibliography page of his website, Erik Larsen explains that he uses a Staedtler Mars Lumograph 100 2H pencil, and a Staedtler Mars Plastic Eraser. However, on the site&#x27;s Frequently Asked Questions page, he states that he uses a standard Dixon Ticonderoga #2 pencil with HB lead, explaining, &quot;It&#x27;s mushy as all hell but it doesn&#x27;t slow me down like a harder pencil would.&quot;

=== Amanda Conner ===
While reading each page of a script, artist Amanda Conner does tiny thumbnail sketches with stick figures corresponding to the story indicated on each page, in order to help her design the page&#x27;s layout. She then does tighter, more elaborate sketches, though still fairly small compared with the finished artwork, approximately , and then blows those up on a photocopier to the proper original comic art size, which is 10 inches x 15 inches. She then uses &quot;very tight pencils&quot; to light-box it onto Bristol board, if she intends to have it inked by her husband and collaborator, Jimmy Palmiotti, but will do the pencils &quot;lighter and looser&quot; if she intends to ink it herself, as she already knows how she wants the artwork rendered. Conner has created her own paper stock and blue line format on her drawing paper, because, she explains, she likes having those configurations pre-printed on the page, and feels that &quot;sometimes the rough is too toothy and the smooth is too slick.&quot; The stock she uses is the Strathmore 500 series, but she also orders a custom stock because she sometimes finds those dimensions more comfortable and easier to work on more quickly. She also finds the Strathmore 300 series &quot;pretty good&quot; likes its nice texture and greater affordability, but says that must occasionally content with getting a &quot;bleedy batch&quot;. Conner uses mechanical pencils with .03 lead because she found it easier to use than regular pencils that require her to stop and sharpen them frequently.

=== Gene Ha ===
Once artist Gene Ha obtains a script, he makes &quot;tiny&quot; thumbnail sketches of each page, and then makes layout sketches on shrunked copies of comic art board, two per page. It is at this stage that he works out the light/dark balance of the page. Though he says about 90% of his artwork are done without photo reference, he will sometimes photograph his friends pose as the central characters, or use a full length mirror to draw himself. He renders minor characters from his imagination. Irrespective of how much sunlight he has on a given day, he prefers to use a 500W incandescent photo lamp, though he believes a 500W halogen lamp is also adequate. He prefers to use a lead holder with H lead for sketching, and 2B lead for shading, which he sharpens with a rotary lead pointer, believing that such leads can be sharpened better than a traditional pencil. He blows up a scan of each page layout to , and draws &quot;tight&quot; pencils on top of these, which are then scanned and printed on inkjet paper in faint blue line. He prefers Xerox paper because he feels that the surface of marker paper tends to get smudgy or oily. When importing art to modify in his computer, he uses Photoshop.

=== Jason Shiga ===
Artist Jason Shiga penciled his 2011 graphic novel &quot;Empire State: A Love Story (Or Not)&quot; with a yellow No. 2 pencil on copy paper, before transferring it with brushed ink via a lightbox.

=== Jonathan Luna ===
Artist Jonathan Luna uses 14 x 17 Strathmore Bristol board, which he cuts into 11 x 17 pieces on which to draw. He draws using a 2H pencil, and after inking his pencils with a Micron pen, he edits his line work on a graphics tablet.

===Marcio Takara===
Artist Marcio Takara begins his pages with ink thumbnail sketches with which he shows his overall ideas to his editor. When he begins the actual pencils, he keeps them &quot;loose&quot;, because he will eventually ink over them himself, and does not require greater specificity. The penciling stage is the fastest stage for Takara, who does all of his pencil work with an HB 0.5 mechanical pencil, completing two or three penciled pages a day, sometimes even inking all three by the end of the day.

===Frank Cho===
Frank Cho produces his artwork on Strathmore 300 Series Bristol Pad, which has a vellum surface. 
To pencil his artwork, Cho uses a Pentel mechanical pencil with 0.7mm HB lead. For erasure, he uses both a Vanish eraser and a kneaded eraser.

===Chris Samnee===
Artist Chris Samnee uses 300 series two-ply Strathmore Bristol board. He does not use non-photo blue pencils or any other equipment purchased at specialty stores for preliminary sketching, but uses .9 mm mechanical pencils that he purchases from Target. He describes his pencils as &quot;just awful&quot;, and inks them himself, as he cannot envision giving them to someone else to ink.

=== Chuck Austen ===
Writer/artist Chuck Austen did his work on &quot;Elektra&quot; entirely on a computer. He prefers uses mostly Macintoshes, but also uses PCs. When using a Mac, he uses &quot;Ray Dream Studio&quot;, and when using a PC, usings &quot;3D Studio Max&quot;. These allow him to take three-dimensional models and break them down into simplified two-tone line forms. He purchases the models from catalogues, or uses ones that he built for &quot;Strips&quot; using in &quot;Hash&quot; or &quot;&quot;. After importing the models into &quot;Studio&quot; or &quot;Max&quot;, he arranges the angles and other aspects of the scene before rendering them, such as placement of background objects or modifying gestures, while the computer corrects elements such as perspective, foreshortening, proportions, etc. After the files are rendered to Austen&#x27;s satisfaction, he assembles them into page form using Photoshop, completing details that the modeling programs cannot perfect, such as facial expressions, hair, filling in blacks, rendering clothes and wrinkles, etc. To finish the art, he will either print out the &quot;pencils&quot; directly onto Bristol board and finalize them with an HB Tombow pencil and ink them with a #2 nib, or will apply the finishes in Photoshop.

=== Scott McCloud ===
Scott McCloud also does his work almost entirely on a computer tablet. Although he sketches his layouts in pencil, the remainder of his work is done digitally, explaining in his 2006 book &quot;Making Comics&quot; that he had not used traditional materials like Bristol board, pens or brushes in years. After sketching layouts, which he says are &quot;pretty tight&quot;, and include the full script, he scans them into an 18-inch tablet/monitor to use them as a guide for lettering them in Adobe Illustrator. After completing the lettering, he exports the files to Photoshop, where he fully renders the art at a resolution of 1,200 dpi, creating between five and fifty layers of finished art before flattening it into a single black and white bitmap, plus a greyscale page, if needed.

=== Fiona Staples ===
Another artist who does her work almost entirely digitally is Fiona Staples, who switched to that process several years prior to beginning her work on &quot;Saga&quot;, though her process for that series is different from previous ones, for which she characterizes it as &quot;one intense, ongoing experiment.&quot; She begins with thumbnails, roughly drawn on printed paper templates. During this stage Staples does not use reference, but does so later in the inking stage. During the thumbnail stage, she gives copious thought to the layouts and staging, making it, in her words, the most important part of the process. After scanning the thumbnails, she enlarges them and uses them as rudimentary pencils, and &quot;inks&quot; over them in Manga Studio, and later colors the art in Photoshop. One of the advantages Staples sees in working digitally is the ability to dispense with tight pencils in favor of making corrections in an ad hoc manner, as she finds penciling in great detail and drawing such art a second time in ink to be boring.

==Workflow and style==
A comic book penciller usually works closely with the comic book&#x27;s editor, who commissions a script from the writer and sends it to the penciller.

Comic book scripts can take a variety of forms. Some writers, such as Alan Moore, produce complete, elaborate, and lengthy outlines of each page. Others send the artist only a plot outline consisting of no more than a short overview of key scenes with little or no dialogue. Stan Lee was known to prefer this latter form, and thus it came to be known as the Marvel Method.

Sometimes a writer or another artist (such as an art director) will include basic layouts, called &quot;breakdowns,&quot; to assist the penciller in scene composition. If no breakdowns are included, then it falls to the penciller to determine the layout of each page, including the number of panels, their shapes and their positions. Even when these visual details are indicated by a script, a penciller may feel when drawing the scene that there is a different way of composing the scene, and may disregard the script, usually following consultation with the editor and/or writer.

Some artists use a loose pencilling approach, in which the penciller does not take much care to reduce the vagaries of the pencil art, leaving it to the inker to interpret the penciller&#x27;s intent. In those cases, the penciller is usually credited with &quot;breakdowns&quot; or &quot;layouts&quot; and the inker is credited as the &quot;embellisher&quot; or &quot;finisher&quot;. According to former Marvel editor Gregory Wright, John Buscema was a noted penciler whose breakdowns included all the structural essentials that enabled inkers to complete the art. Other pencillers prefer to create detailed pages, where every nuance that they expect to see in the inked art is indicated. This is known as tight pencilling.

<text>The National Intelligence Organization (), also known by its Turkish initials MIT or MİT, or colloquially as the Organization (), is an intelligence agency of the Turkish government tasked with gathering information of national interests. It gathers information for the Presidency and the Armed Forces about the current and potential threats from inside and outside against all the elements that make up Turkey&#x27;s integrity, constitutional order, existence, independence, security and national power and takes precautions when necessary.

The MIT is under the provision of the Presidency. It works closely with the Turkish diplomatic missions overseas.

==History==
The organization was formerly named as the Millî Emniyet Hizmetleri Teşkilatı () (MAH). One of the MAH directors was Celal Tevfik Karasapan who held the post between 1959 and 1960.

On 9 February 2023 the &quot;National Intelligence Academy&quot; (NIA), in Turkish &quot;Milli İstihbarat Akademisi&quot;, was founded and began its activities on 6 January 2024. It is an institution within MIT with the purpose &quot;to provide postgraduate education and conduct scientific research in intelligence, security and strategy.&quot;

== Organization ==
=== Organizational structure ===
The Organization is headed by a Director-General, who is appointed by the President of Turkey. The Director-General is typically a career intelligence officer with past experience in intelligence and security matters.

The organization is divided into various departments and units, each specializing in specific areas of intelligence, counterterrorism, and analysis. These units include the Counterterrorism Department, Foreign Relations Department, Signals Intelligence Department, and more.

=== Connections to the Turkish military ===
According to the former director of Foreign Operations, Yavuz Ataç, the military presence in the organization is negligible, although the organization has a military heritage. In 1990, the percentage of military personnel was 35%, while in 2007 the lower echelons were 4.5% military. While the organization has historically recruited from relatives of existing employees, the former director, Emre Taner, says that this is no longer the case.

=== Duties ===

The MİT is in charge of collecting intelligence on existing and potential threats from internal and external sources posed against the territory, people and integrity, the existence, independence, security, and all the other elements that compose the constitutional order and the national power of the Republic of Turkey. The MİT is in charge of communicating this intelligence to the President, the Chief of the General Staff, the Secretary General of the National Security Council and other relevant state organizations as necessary.

The MİT is in charge of counterintelligence activities in Turkey. Legally, it cannot be given any other duty and cannot be led to any other field of activity than collecting intelligence concerning the security of the Republic. The MİT engages in cyberwarfare. The Turkish Ministry of National Defence considers cybersecurity as the country&#x27;s &quot;fifth frontier&quot; after land, air, sea and space. The MİT uses local cybersecurity solutions mostly developed by companies like HAVELSAN and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.

== Activities ==
In 2014, it was revealed in the Turkey&#x27;s Parliament&#x27;s Internal Affairs Commission that the MİT has units working abroad and was wiretapping the telephones of 2,473 people, mostly related to &quot;terrorism and spying activities.&quot;

On 5 April 2018, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdağ said that MIT has captured 80 Turkish citizens, suspected of links to FETÖ, from 18 different countries so far.

On 16 October 2020, according to Reuters, Turkey&#x27;s intelligence officials arrested a man, suspected of spying on foreign Arab nationals on behalf of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The officials said that the man entered Turkey using a non-UAE passport. The detainee confessed to the charges and Turkish authorities obtained &quot;a trove of documents&quot; from him showing UAE affiliation, but there were no reactions received from the UAE. In 2019, Turkey arrested two men suspected of spying on Arab nationals for the UAE. One of the men was connected to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

In 2022, MIT participated and helped in the prisoner swap between Konstantin Yaroshenko (Russia) and Trevor Reed (USA) which took place in Istanbul.

The 2014 National Intelligence Organisation scandal in Turkey revealed MIT&#x27;s role in supplying arms to Syrian rebels in Syria. The Turkish journalists who exposed this arrangement were charged with espionage and &quot;divulging state secrets&quot; by the Turkish courts. One of the journalists claimed:&#x27;Those who sent the convoy from Turkey knew that the weapons were &quot;heading to end [up] in ISIS hands&quot;&#x27;. Turkish Army officers who intercepted some of the intelligence agency&#x27;s weapons-filled trucks also faced espionage charges. In June 2019, a Turkish court sentenced the group of officers and prosecutors who stopped the MIT trucks to at least two decades behind bars for obtaining and disclosing confidential state documents. They were also accused of being FETÖ members. 
The Turkish newspaper &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot; published video footage which it said showed security forces discovering weapons parts being sent to Syria on trucks belonging to MIT. In December 2020, Turkish court sentenced to prison 27 people because they stopped the MIT trucks in 2014.

According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on &quot;German Turks&quot;. Hans-Christian Ströbele told that there was an &quot;unbelievable&quot; level of &quot;secret activities&quot; in Germany by Turkey&#x27;s MIT agency. According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large &quot;army of agents&quot; in the former West Germany: &quot;Here, it&#x27;s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.&quot; German lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.

A German security official said that &quot;we are horrified at how openly Turkey reveals that it is spying on Turks living here&quot;. On 30 March 2017 Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere expresses suspicions that the move may have been intended to weigh on Turkish-German relations − &quot;to provoke us in some way&quot;. The appallment was deepened when it was revealed that the 300 persons included politicians, including Michelle Müntefering.

In June 2017, according to news reports, Turkish Intelligence had reportedly been collecting an increasing amount of information on Bundestag members who are involved in defense as well as domestic and foreign policy. A spokeswoman for Bundeskriminalamt confirmed the report that the agency met with German MPs &quot;in recent weeks&quot; to discuss &quot;safety&quot; concerns, since &quot;protecting members of the Bundestag is a legal task of the BKA&quot;.

In October 2017, according to German press reports officials working in Germany&#x27;s immigration authorities pass on information about Turkish asylum seekers to Turkey. In many cases, even their locations were also revealed, that even their families did not know for security reasons. These incidents showed that Turkish spies may have infiltrated German authorities. In addition, Herbert Reul, the interior minister for the German state of the North Rhine-Westphalia, submitted a report to the state parliament, alleging that the Turkish-German organisation &quot;Osmanen Germania&quot; works with MIT.

<doc id="575960" wikidata="Q1153051" url="?curid=575960" title="Inker">
<text>The inker (sometimes credited as the finisher or embellisher) is one of the two line artists in traditional comic book production.

After the penciller creates a drawing, the inker interprets this drawing by outlining and embellishing it with a pencil, a pen or a brush. Inking was necessary in the traditional printing process as presses could not reproduce pencilled drawings. Another specialist, the letterer, handles the &quot;inking&quot; of text, while the colorist applies color to the final art submitted by the inker.

== Workflow ==

While inking involves tracing pencil lines in a literal sense, it is an act of creative interpretation rather than rote copying. Inkers fine-tune the composition by adding the proper weight to lines, creating visual contrast through shading, and making other creative choices. A pencil drawing can have many shades of grey depending on the hardness of the graphite and the pressure applied by the artist, but an ink line generally can be only solid black. Accordingly, the inker has to translate pencil shading into patterns of ink, for example by using closely spaced parallel lines, feathering, or cross-hatching. The result is that the final look of a penciller&#x27;s art can vary enormously depending on the inker.

An experienced inker paired with a novice penciler might also be responsible for correcting anatomical or other mistakes, modifying facial expressions, or changing or improving the artwork in a variety of other ways. Alternatively, an inker may do the basic layout of the page, give the work to another artist to do more detailed pencil work, and then ink the page themself (as Joe Simon often did when inking Jack Kirby, or when Michael T. Gilbert collaborated with penciler P. Craig Russell on the Elric of Melniboné series).

The division between penciller and inker described here is most frequently found where the penciller and inker are hired independently of each other by the publisher. Where an artist instead hires their own assistants, the roles are less structured; an artist might, for example, ink all the faces of the characters while leaving the assistant to ink in the backgrounds, or work with the inker in a more collaborative fashion. Among Neal Adams&#x27; Crusty Bunkers, one inker may have been responsible for the characters&#x27; heads, another doing bodies, and a third embellishing backgrounds. The inking duo Akin &amp; Garvey had a similar arrangement, with one inking the figures and the other the backgrounds.

=== Digital inking ===
One can ink digitally using computers, a practice that has started to become more common as inkers learn to use powerful drawing and editing tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Inkscape, Corel Painter, and Manga Studio. A graphics tablet is the most common tool used to accurately ink digitally, and use of vector-based programs precludes pixelization due to changes in resolution. However the process is more time-consuming.

 some companies put scanned pencils on an FTP site. The inker downloads them, prints them in blue, inks the pages, scans them in and loads the finished pages back on the FTP site for the company to download. While this procedure saves a company time and shipping costs, it requires artists to spend money on computer equipment.

== History ==

For a long time, inking was considered a minor part of the comics industry, only marginally above lettering in the pecking order. In the early days of comic books, many publishers hired &quot;packagers&quot; to produce entire books. Although some &quot;star&quot; creators&#x27; names (such as Simon and Kirby or Bob Kane) usually appeared at the beginning of each story, the publisher generally did not care which artists worked on the book. In the early days, the creator of the feature would get credit for as long as they worked on the feature, but when they were replaced by other artists, no name credit would be given to them. Packagers instituted an assembly line style method of creating books, using top talents like Kirby to create the look and pace of the story and then handing off the inking, lettering, and coloring to largely anonymous – and low-paid – creators to finish it.

Deadline pressures and a desire for consistency in the look of a feature led to having one artist pencil a feature while one or more other artists inked it. At Marvel Comics, where the pencil artist was responsible for the frame-by-frame breakdown of the story plot, an artist who was skilled in story-telling would be encouraged to do as many books as possible, maximizing the number of books they could do by leaving the inking to others. By contrast, at other companies where the writer did the frame-by-frame breakdown in script form, more artists inked or even lettered their own work. Joe Kubert, Jim Aparo and Alex Toth would usually pencil, ink and letter, considering the placing of word balloons as an integral part of the page, and artists such as Bill Everett, Steve Ditko, Kurt Schaffenberger, Murphy Anderson, and Nick Cardy almost always inked their own work (and sometimes the work of other pencilers as well). Most artists, however – even experienced inkers of their own work like Lou Fine, Reed Crandall, Will Eisner, and Alex Toth – at times hired or allowed other artists to ink their drawings. Some artists could make more money by pencilling more pages and leaving the inking to others; different artists with different working methods might find it more profitable to both pencil and ink, as they could place less information and detail in the pencil drawings if they were inking it themselves and could put that detail in at the inking stage.

Due to the absence of credits on most Golden Age comic books, many inkers of that period are largely forgotten. For those whose names are known, it is difficult to compile résumés. Inkers like Chic Stone, George Papp, and Marvin Stein embellished thousands of pages during that era, most of which are still unidentified.

==Crediting==
In the early 1960s, Marvel Comics began giving the inker credit in each of their publications and other publishers began to follow suit. This allowed finishers like Dick Ayers, Joe Sinnott, Mike Esposito, John Severin, Syd Shores, and Tom Palmer to earn a reputation as inkers as well as pencillers. In addition, penciller–inker teams like Kirby and Sinnott, Curt Swan and Murphy Anderson, Gene Colan and Palmer, and John Byrne and Terry Austin captured the attentions of comic book fandom.

==Industry awards==
In 2008 Marvel and DC inker Bob Almond founded the Inkwell Awards, which is an award established to celebrate the craft of inking and to lift the profile of the art in general. The Inkwell Awards has gained much publicity and counts notable inkers such as Joe Sinnott, Nathan Massengill and Tim Townsend as members and associates.

<doc id="575962" wikidata="Q1849818" url="?curid=575962" title="Battle of Edgcote">
<text>The Battle of Edgcote (also known as the Battle of Banbury or the Battle of Danes Moor) took place on 24 July 1469, during the Wars of the Roses. It was fought between a royal army, commanded by the earls of Pembroke and Devon, and a rebel force led by supporters of the Earl of Warwick.

The battle took place northeast of Banbury in Oxfordshire; it resulted in a rebel victory which temporarily handed power over to the Earl of Warwick. By September, though, Edward IV of England was back in control, and Warwick found himself in a situation similar to the one before the battle, prompting him to plan a second rebellion. After Edgcote there was no turning back. Edward could no longer trust him fully and he was inexorably moving towards becoming a Lancastrian.

Edgcote has a reputation for being one of the least well-documented battles of the period, though numerous contemporary, or near contemporary, records and chronicles refer to it. Details in accounts diverge in terms of numbers, leaders, casualties, and the course of the fighting, but not all of these &quot;divergences&quot; are contradictory. The heavy casualties suffered by Pembroke&#x27;s Welsh forces made it a popular topic for Welsh poets.

==Background==

Close allies in deposing Henry VI in 1461, by 1469 the relationship between Warwick and Edward IV had broken down. After marrying Elizabeth Woodville in 1464, Edward increasingly relied on her family, who competed with the Nevilles for lands and positions. Concerned by his close connection with Warwick, Edward blocked a proposed marriage between Clarence, his younger brother and heir, and Warwick&#x27;s eldest daughter Isabel. For various reasons, Clarence greatly resented this.

In April 1469, a revolt broke out in Yorkshire, under a leader called Robin of Redesdale. His true identity is unknown. Numerous candidates have been suggested: Sir John Conyers, steward of Warwick&#x27;s Middleham Castle, either of his son, another John Conyers or Sir William Conyers of Marske (d. 1469), Sir Richard Welles, and Sir Henry Neville. Alternatively, he could have been an unknown commoner, a &quot;villain called Robin of Riddesdale&quot; as described in Jean de Waurin&#x27;s Chronicle. In May, a second rebellion began, led by a figure known as Robin of Holderness, demanding the restoration of Henry Percy, traditional Earl of Northumberland.

John Neville, the current Earl, quickly suppressed this and executed its leader, although he made little attempt to intercept Robin of Redesdale. Confident the rebellion was well in hand and accompanied only by his personal household troops, Edward moved slowly north through Lincolnshire, reaching Crowland in early July. On 9 July, he discovered the rebel army was considerably larger than previously advised, followed by even more disturbing news from London.

Warwick and Clarence spent the summer assembling troops, allegedly to help suppress the revolt; in early July, they travelled to Calais, where Clarence married Isabel in a ceremony conducted by Warwick&#x27;s brother George, Archbishop of York. The three men then issued a &#x27;remonstrance&#x27;, listing alleged abuses by the Woodvilles, William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke and Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Devon among others. They entered London on 12 July, and on 18th, marched north with to link up with the Yorkshire rebels.

Edward withdrew to Nottingham and sent urgent instructions to Pembroke in Raglan Castle and Devon in Dorchester, ordering them to meet him there with as many men as they could muster. The northern rebels headed for Northampton, intending to link up with Warwick and Clarence. A small skirmish was fought in the area of Northampton, before the Royal forces retreated towards Banbury. The army camped on Edgcote Lodge Hill and late in the afternoon of 23 July, a brief skirmish was fought between the Royal picquets and the rebel outriders. Sir Henry Neville was captured in the skirmish, and killed after attempting to yield. Pembroke himself, together with the other commander, Devon, were in lodgings in Banbury. According to most of the chroniclers they had a disagreement over lodgings, and Devon retired, taking his part of the army with him. Devon reportedly took his troops ten or twelve miles away. Tradition has it he retreated to Deddington Castle, but there is no contemporary evidence that this was his final location.

==Battle==

Estimates suggest Pembroke had some 3,000 to 5,000 Welsh knights and spearmen, with 800 to 1,500 under Devon, including most of the archers. Aware of the need to destroy the northern army before they were reinforced, Pembroke&#x27;s army was camped overnight on high ground to the north-east. This overlooked the site of the 914 CE Battle of Danes Moor, with the two armies separated by a tributary of the River Cherwell.

The rebel army contained a large contingent of archers, putting Pembroke at a disadvantage; he ordered his troops forward and the two sides fought at close quarters for the rest of the morning. By early afternoon, the Royal army had gained control of the river crossing, but at this point, Warwick&#x27;s advance guard arrived upon the field, led by Sir Geoffrey Gates and Sir William Parr. Gates and Parr were able to hold the rebels together, but they were still under severe pressure when further rebel reinforcements arrived, led by John Clapham.

In one account Devon was still present, and fled at this point. However, what ever was the case, the Royal army believed this to be Warwick and his forces. Pembroke&#x27;s men broke. Casualties were reported as 168 knights and gentry, plus 2,000 rank and file, losses significant enough to be remembered and referenced by Welsh poets a century later. Pembroke was captured and executed at Northampton later in the week, on Thursday 27 July; his brother Sir Richard Herbert had been executed the previous day, Wednesday 26 July. Their half brother Sir Richard Vaughan died during the battle and Devon was beheaded at Bridgwater on 17 August.

There are few details on rebel casualties but they would have been considerably less than those suffered by Pembroke since most deaths occurred during a pursuit. Apart from Henry Neville, killed on the evening before the battle, these included Sir William Conyers, and Sir Oliver Dudley, youngest son of John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley.

==Aftermath==

Edward was taken into custody and held in Middleham Castle. His in-laws Earl Rivers and John Woodville were executed at Gosford Green Coventry on 12 August 1469. There is no evidence of any summary trial taking place. However, it soon became clear there was little support for Warwick or Clarence; Edward was released in September and resumed the throne.

Richard Herbert was buried in the Herbert chapel at Abergavenny Priory, which survived the damage caused during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 to 1541. It also includes the tomb of William Herbert&#x27;s illegitimate son, Richard Herbert of Ewyas, who was brought up with Henry Tudor, later Henry VII and fought on his side at Bosworth in 1485.

==Commemoration and re-enactments==
On 12 and 13 September 2009 there was a re-creation of the battle on the actual battlefield, staged by the Medieval Siege Society and the English Tournament Society to commemorate the 540th anniversary.

Following the success of the 2009 commemoration and re-enactment, a second recreation was staged on 11 and 12 September 2010 for the 541st anniversary.

The 550th anniversary was the subject of several activities organised by the Northamptonshire Battlefields Society, the Medieval Siege Society no longer being actively involved in events connected with Edgcote. These activities included a day conference highlighting new research, and the publication of a book. The Society also organises an annual walk to commemorate the battle on the anniversary itself. Details can be found on the Society&#x27;s Facebook page.

In 2021 Edgcote was one of eight Wars of the Roses battles commemorated on stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the 550th anniversary of the Battle of Tewkesbury. The stamps used paintings by noted historical artist Graham Turner, and included a presentation pack with notes by historian David Grummitt. Controversy arose because the Edgcote stamp was incorrectly labelled &quot;Edgecote Moor&quot;, and the accompanying presentation pack stated the date of the battle as being 26 July. These errors were highlighted by the Northamptonshire Battlefields Society, and the story was picked up by BBC Radio Northampton, and subsequently reported on the BBC website. The Royal Mail issued a statement saying they were aware of the controversy over the name, but had chosen to go with their expert&#x27;s recommendation, although both the spelling of &quot;Edgecote&quot;, and the place name &quot;Edgecote Moor&quot; do not appear in the Royal Mail postal address database.

== Threats ==
The Registered Battlefield area is described by Historic England as &quot;largely undeveloped&quot; and that &quot; comparisons with other War of the Roses sites indicates that a high order of archaeological potential can be anticipated here&quot;. In August 2020 One Planet Ltd, experts in obtaining planning permission for renewable energy projects submitted a screening proposal on behalf of the landowners, Culworth Grounds, requesting the waiver of an Environmental Impact Assessment ahead of a full planning application. The proposal places the development on the &quot;East Hill&quot; mentioned in the sources, at the heart of the fighting. The development will have considerable visual impact on the location, as it will be surrounded by high &quot;deer fences&quot; and CCTV cameras on poles. Despite opposition from Historic England, NCC Archaeology, the Battlefields Trust, the Northamptonshire Battlefields Society and numerous members of the public, the waiver was granted, principally on the grounds that at 40 years lifespan the development is regarded as temporary and reversible. Heritage groups continue to express their concern, and objections to the formal planning application are anticipated.

The proposed route of HS2 passes along the North Eastern edge of the registered battlefield, but by-passes Danes Moor, the location of the fighting.

== Historiographical errors ==
Two major errors in respect of the battle have entered the historiography of the battle, through excessive reliance on one or two major sources in English. The first is the reference to the battle as &quot;Edgecote Moor&quot;. A review of all of the primary or near primary records show that the battle was known as Edgcote (although contemporary spellings varied), Banbury or Danes Moor, as stated above. In the 19th century it was referred to as &quot;The Battle of Edgecote&quot;, before the Ordnance Survey standardised the spelling to Edgcote on or before 1884. &quot;Edgecote Moor&quot; is a more recent affectation, combining &quot;Edgecote&quot; and &quot;Danes Moor&quot;, and dates from the mid 1990s. Uniquely amongst battles in the Wars of the Roses modern writers have not consistently used the modern day spelling.

The second error relates to the date of the battle. Welsh sources, and contemporary English official records, such as the Coventry Leet Book, and early chronicles clearly place the battle of the eve of the Feast of Saint James, or Monday, 24 July 1469. The reference to 26 July comes from Warkworth&#x27;s Chronicle, and is repeated in Hall, who places the battle the day after the Feast of Saint James. Hall&#x27;s work, as it contains the most detail, has then formed the basis for most descriptions and accounts of the battle. The error in respect of the date was identified as early as 1982, and has been restated particularly by Welsh scholars. This has been overlooked by English writers, with the notable exception of Michael Hicks who places the battle on 24 July.

<doc id="575963" wikidata="Q2737866" url="?curid=575963" title="Scientific visualization">
<text>Scientific visualization (also spelled scientific visualisation) is an interdisciplinary branch of science concerned with the visualization of scientific phenomena. It is also considered a subset of computer graphics, a branch of computer science. The purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data. Research into how people read and misread various types of visualizations is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most understandable and effective in conveying information.

==History==

One of the earliest examples of three-dimensional scientific visualisation was Maxwell&#x27;s thermodynamic surface, sculpted in clay in 1874 by James Clerk Maxwell. This prefigured modern scientific visualization techniques that use computer graphics.

Notable early two-dimensional examples include the flow map of Napoleon&#x27;s March on Moscow produced by Charles Joseph Minard in 1869; the &quot;coxcombs&quot; used by Florence Nightingale in 1857 as part of a campaign to improve sanitary conditions in the British Army; and the dot map used by John Snow in 1855 to visualise the Broad Street cholera outbreak.

== Data visualization methods==
Criteria for classifications:
* dimension of the data
* method
** textura based methods
** geometry-based approaches such as arrow plots, streamlines, pathlines, timelines, streaklines, particle tracing, surface particles, stream arrows, stream tubes, stream balls, flow volumes and topological analysis

=== Two-dimensional data sets ===
Scientific visualization using computer graphics gained in popularity as graphics matured. Primary applications were scalar fields and vector fields from computer simulations and also measured data. The primary methods for visualizing two-dimensional (2D) scalar fields are color mapping and drawing contour lines. 2D vector fields are visualized using glyphs and streamlines or line integral convolution methods. 2D tensor fields are often resolved to a vector field by using one of the two eigenvectors to represent the tensor each point in the field and then visualized using vector field visualization methods.

=== Three-dimensional data sets ===
For 3D scalar fields the primary methods are volume rendering and isosurfaces. Methods for visualizing vector fields include glyphs (graphical icons) such as arrows, streamlines and streaklines, particle tracing, line integral convolution (LIC) and topological methods. Later, visualization techniques such as hyperstreamlines were developed to visualize 2D and 3D tensor fields.

== Topics ==


=== Computer animation ===
Computer animation is the art, technique, and science of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is becoming more common to be created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film. It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films. Applications include medical animation, which is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients.

===Computer simulation===
Computer simulation is a computer program, or network of computers, that attempts to simulate an abstract model of a particular system. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modelling of many natural systems in physics, and computational physics, chemistry and biology; human systems in economics, psychology, and social science; and in the process of engineering and new technology, to gain insight into the operation of those systems, or to observe their behavior. The simultaneous visualization and simulation of a system is called visulation.

Computer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes, to network-based groups of computers running for hours, to ongoing simulations that run for months. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using the traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling: over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation, of one force invading another, involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait, using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program.

=== Information visualization ===
Information visualization is the study of &quot;the visual representation of large-scale collections of non-numerical information, such as files and lines of code in software systems, library and bibliographic databases, networks of relations on the internet, and so forth&quot;.

Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways. Visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye&#x27;s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. The key difference between scientific visualization and information visualization is that information visualization is often applied to data that is not generated by scientific inquiry. Some examples are graphical representations of data for business, government, news and social media.

===Interface technology and perception===
Interface technology and perception shows how new interfaces and a better understanding of underlying perceptual issues create new opportunities for the scientific visualization community.

=== Surface rendering ===
Rendering is the process of generating an image from a model, by means of computer programs. The model is a description of three-dimensional objects in a strictly defined language or data structure. It would contain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information. The image is a digital image or raster graphics image. The term may be by analogy with an &quot;artist&#x27;s rendering&quot; of a scene. &#x27;Rendering&#x27; is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output. Important rendering techniques are:

;Scanline rendering and rasterisation
: A high-level representation of an image necessarily contains elements in a different domain from pixels. These elements are referred to as primitives. In a schematic drawing, for instance, line segments and curves might be primitives. In a graphical user interface, windows and buttons might be the primitives. In 3D rendering, triangles and polygons in space might be primitives.

;Ray casting
: Ray casting is primarily used for realtime simulations, such as those used in 3D computer games and cartoon animations, where detail is not important, or where it is more efficient to manually fake the details in order to obtain better performance in the computational stage. This is usually the case when a large number of frames need to be animated. The resulting surfaces have a characteristic &#x27;flat&#x27; appearance when no additional tricks are used, as if objects in the scene were all painted with matte finish.

;Radiosity
:Radiosity, also known as Global Illumination, is a method that attempts to simulate the way in which directly illuminated surfaces act as indirect light sources that illuminate other surfaces. This produces more realistic shading and seems to better capture the &#x27;ambience&#x27; of an indoor scene. A classic example is the way that shadows &#x27;hug&#x27; the corners of rooms.

;Ray tracing
:Ray tracing is an extension of the same technique developed in scanline rendering and ray casting. Like those, it handles complicated objects well, and the objects may be described mathematically. Unlike scanline and casting, ray tracing is almost always a Monte Carlo technique, that is one based on averaging a number of randomly generated samples from a model.

=== Volume rendering ===
Volume rendering is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a CT or MRI scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.

=== Volume visualization ===
According to Rosenblum (1994) &quot;volume visualization examines a set of techniques that allows viewing an object without mathematically representing the other surface. Initially used in medical imaging, volume visualization has become an essential technique for many sciences, portraying phenomena become an essential technique such as clouds, water flows, and molecular and biological structure. Many volume visualization algorithms are computationally expensive and demand large data storage. Advances in hardware and software are generalizing volume visualization as well as real time performances&quot;.

Developments of web-based technologies, and in-browser rendering have allowed of simple volumetric presentation of a cuboid with a changing frame of reference to show volume, mass and density data.

== Applications ==
This section will give a series of examples how scientific visualization can be applied today.

=== In the natural sciences ===
&quot;Star formation&quot;: The featured plot is a Volume plot of the logarithm of gas/dust density in an Enzo star and galaxy simulation. Regions of high density are white while less dense regions are more blue and also more transparent.

&quot;Gravitational waves&quot;: Researchers used the Globus Toolkit to harness the power of multiple supercomputers to simulate the gravitational effects of black-hole collisions.

&quot;Massive Star Supernovae Explosions&quot;: In the image, three-Dimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Calculations of Massive Star Supernovae Explosions The DJEHUTY stellar evolution code was used to calculate the explosion of SN 1987A model in three dimensions.

&quot;Molecular rendering&quot;: VisIt&#x27;s general plotting capabilities were used to create the molecular rendering shown in the featured visualization. The original data was taken from the Protein Data Bank and turned into a VTK file before rendering.

=== In geography and ecology ===
&quot;Terrain visualization&quot;: VisIt can read several file formats common in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allowing one to plot raster data such as terrain data in visualizations. The featured image shows a plot of a DEM dataset containing mountainous areas near Dunsmuir, CA. Elevation lines are added to the plot to help delineate changes in elevation.

&quot;Tornado Simulation&quot;: This image was created from data generated by a tornado simulation calculated on NCSA&#x27;s IBM p690 computing cluster. High-definition television animations of the storm produced at NCSA were included in an episode of the PBS television series NOVA called &quot;Hunt for the Supertwister.&quot; The tornado is shown by spheres that are colored according to pressure; orange and blue tubes represent the rising and falling airflow around the tornado.

&quot;Climate visualization&quot;: This visualization depicts the carbon dioxide from various sources that are advected individually as tracers in the atmosphere model. Carbon dioxide from the ocean is shown as plumes during February 1900.

&quot;Atmospheric Anomaly in Times Square&quot; In the image the results from the SAMRAI simulation framework of an atmospheric anomaly in and around Times Square are visualized.

=== In mathematics ===

Scientific visualization of mathematical structures has been undertaken for purposes of building intuition and for aiding the forming of mental models.

Higher-dimensional objects can be visualized in form of projections (views) in lower dimensions. In particular, 4-dimensional objects are visualized by means of projection in three dimensions. The lower-dimensional projections of higher-dimensional objects can be used for purposes of virtual object manipulation, allowing 3D objects to be manipulated by operations performed in 2D, and 4D objects by interactions performed in 3D.

In complex analysis, functions of the complex plane are inherently 4-dimensional, but there is no natural geometric projection into lower dimensional visual representations. Instead, colour vision is exploited to capture dimensional information using techniques such as domain coloring.

=== In the formal sciences ===
&quot;Computer mapping of topographical surfaces&quot;: Through computer mapping of topographical surfaces, mathematicians can test theories of how materials will change when stressed. The imaging is part of the work on the NSF-funded Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

&quot;Curve plots&quot;: VisIt can plot curves from data read from files and it can be used to extract and plot curve data from higher-dimensional datasets using lineout operators or queries. The curves in the featured image correspond to elevation data along lines drawn on DEM data and were created with the feature lineout capability. Lineout allows you to interactively draw a line, which specifies a path for data extraction. The resulting data was then plotted as curves.

&quot;Image annotations&quot;: The featured plot shows Leaf Area Index (LAI), a measure of global vegetative matter, from a NetCDF dataset. The primary plot is the large plot at the bottom, which shows the LAI for the whole world. The plots on top are actually annotations that contain images generated earlier. Image annotations can be used to include material that enhances a visualization such as auxiliary plots, images of experimental data, project logos, etc.

&quot;Scatter plot&quot;: VisIt&#x27;s Scatter plot allows visualizing multivariate data of up to four dimensions. The Scatter plot takes multiple scalar variables and uses them for different axes in phase space. The different variables are combined to form coordinates in the phase space and they are displayed using glyphs and colored using another scalar variable.

=== In the applied sciences ===
&quot;Porsche 911 model&quot; (NASTRAN model): The featured plot contains a Mesh plot of a Porsche 911 model imported from a NASTRAN bulk data file. VisIt can read a limited subset of NASTRAN bulk data files, in general enough to import model geometry for visualization.

&quot;YF-17 aircraft Plot&quot;: The featured image displays plots of a CGNS dataset representing a YF-17 jet aircraft. The dataset consists of an unstructured grid with solution. The image was created by using a pseudocolor plot of the dataset&#x27;s Mach variable, a Mesh plot of the grid, and Vector plot of a slice through the Velocity field.

&quot;City rendering&quot;: An ESRI shapefile containing a polygonal description of the building footprints was read in and then the polygons were resampled onto a rectilinear grid, which was extruded into the featured cityscape.

&quot;Inbound traffic measured&quot;: This image is a visualization study of inbound traffic measured in billions of bytes on the NSFNET T1 backbone for the month of September 1991. The traffic volume range is depicted from purple (zero bytes) to white (100 billion bytes). It represents data collected by Merit Network, Inc.

<text>Tenedos (, &quot;Tenedhos&quot;; ), or Bozcaada in Turkish, is an island of Turkey in the northeastern part of the Aegean Sea. Administratively, the island constitutes the Bozcaada district of Çanakkale Province. With an area of , it is the third-largest Turkish island after Imbros (Gökçeada) and Marmara. In 2022, the district had a population of 3,120 inhabitants. The main industries are tourism, wine production and fishing. The island has been famous for its grapes, wines and red poppies for centuries. It is a former bishopric and presently a Latin Catholic titular see.
Tenedos is mentioned in both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, in the latter as the site where the Greeks hid their fleet near the end of the Trojan War in order to trick the Trojans into believing the war was over and into taking the Trojan Horse within their city walls. Despite its small size, the island was important throughout classical antiquity due to its strategic location at the entrance of the Dardanelles. In the following centuries, the island came under the control of a succession of regional powers, including the Persian Empire, the Delian League, the empire of Alexander the Great, the Attalid kingdom, the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire, before passing to the Republic of Venice. As a result of the War of Chioggia (1381) between Genoa and Venice the entire population was evacuated and the town was demolished. The Ottoman Empire established control over the deserted island in 1455. During Ottoman rule, it was resettled by both Greeks and Turks. In 1807, the island was temporarily occupied by the Russians. During this invasion the town was burnt down and many Turkish residents left the island.

Under Greek administration between 1912 and 1923, Tenedos was ceded to Turkey with the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) which ended the Turkish War of Independence following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I. The treaty called for a quasi-autonomous administration to accommodate the local Greek population and excluded the Greeks on the two islands of Imbros and Tenedos from the wider population exchanges that took place between Greece and Turkey. Tenedos remained majority Greek until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many Greeks emigrated because of better opportunities elsewhere. Starting with the second half of the 20th century, there has been immigration from mainland Anatolia, especially Romani from the town of Bayramiç.

== Name ==
The island is known in English as both Tenedos (the Greek name) and Bozcaada (the Turkish name). Over the centuries many other names have been used. Documented ancient Greek names for the island are Leukophrys, Calydna, Phoenice and Lyrnessus (Pliny, HN 5,140). The official Turkish name for the island is Bozcaada; the Turkish word &quot;boz&quot; means either a barren land or grey to brown color (sources indicate both of these meanings may have been associated with the island) and &quot;ada&quot; meaning island. The name Tenedos was derived, according to Apollodorus of Athens, from the Greek hero Tenes, who ruled the island at the time of the Trojan War and was killed by Achilles. Apollodorus writes that the island was originally known as Leocophrys until Tenes landed on the island and became the ruler. The island became known as Bozcaada when the Ottoman Empire took the island over. Tenedos remained a common name for the island along with Bozcaada after the Ottoman conquest of the island, often with Greek populations and Turkish populations using different names for the island.

== Geography and climate ==
Tenedos is roughly triangular in shape. Its area is . It is the third largest Turkish island after Marmara Island and Imbros (Gökçeada). It is surrounded by small islets, and is situated close to the entrance of the Dardanelles. It is the only rural district (&quot;ilçe&quot;) of Turkey without any villages, and has only one major settlement, the town center.

Geological evidence suggests that the island broke away from the mainland producing a terrain that is mainly plains in the west with hills in the Northeast, and the highest point is . The central part of the island is the most amenable to agricultural activities. There is a small pine forest in the Southwestern part of the island. The westernmost part of the island has large sandy areas not suitable for agriculture.

The island has a Mediterranean climate with strong northern winds called etesians. Average temperature is and the average annual precipitation is around . There are a number of small streams running from north to south at the southwestern part of the island. Freshwater sources though are not enough for the island so water is piped in from the mainland.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Archeological findings indicate that the first human settlement on the island dates back to the Early Bronze Age II (ca. 3000–2700 BC). Archaeological evidence suggests the culture on the island had elements in common with the cultures of northwestern Anatolia and the Cycladic Islands. Most settlement was on the small bays on the east side of the island which formed natural harbours. Settlement archaeological work was done quickly and thus did not find definitive evidence of grape cultivation on the island during this period. However, grape cultivation was common on neighboring islands and the nearby mainland during this time.

According to a reconstruction, based on the myth of Tenes, Walter Leaf stated that the first inhabitants of the island could be Pelasgians, who were driven out of the Anatolian mainland by the Phrygians. According to the same author, there are possible traces of Minoan and Mycenaean Greek influence in the island.

===Antiquity===
Ancient Tenedos is referred to in Greek and Roman mythology, and archaeologists have uncovered evidence of its settlement from the Bronze Age. It would stay prominent through the age of classical Greece, fading by the time of the dominance of ancient Rome. Although a small island, Tenedos&#x27;s position in the straits and its two harbors made it important to the Mediterranean powers over the centuries. For nine months of the year, the currents and the prevailing wind, the etesian, came, and still come, from the Black Sea hampering sailing vessels headed for Constantinople. They had to wait a week or more at Tenedos, waiting for the favorable southerly wind. Tenedos thus served as a shelter and way station for ships bound for the Hellespont, Propontis, Bosphorus, and places farther on. Several of the regional powers captured or attacked the island, including the Athenians, the Persians, the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, the Seleucids and the Attalids.

=== Mythology ===
Homer mentions Apollo as the chief deity of Tenedos in his time. According to him, the island was captured by Achilles during the siege of Troy. Nestor obtained his slave Hecamede there during one of Achilles&#x27;s raids. Nestor also sailed back from Troy stopping at Tenedos and island-hopping to Lesbos. &quot;The Odyssey&quot; mentions the Greeks leaving Troy after winning the war first traveled to nearby Tenedos, sacrificed there, and then went to Lesbos before pausing to choose between alternative routes.

Homer, in the Iliad mention that between Tenedos and Imbros there was a wide cavern, in which Poseidon stayed his horses.

Virgil, in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, described the Achaeans hiding their fleet at the bay of Tenedos, toward the end of the Trojan War, to trick Troy into believing the war was over and allowing them to take the Trojan Horse within Troy&#x27;s city walls. In &quot;Aeneid&quot;, it is also the island from which twin serpents came to kill the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons as punishment for throwing a spear at the Trojan Horse. According to Pindar (Nemean Odes no. 11), the island was founded after the war by bronze-clad warriors from Amyklai, traveling with Orestes.

According to myth, Tenes was the son of Cycnus, himself the son of Poseidon and Calyce. Philonome, Cycnus&#x27;s second wife and hence Tenes&#x27;s stepmother, tried to seduce Tenes and was rejected. She then accused him of rape leading to his abandonment at sea along with his sister. They washed up on the island of Leucophrys where he was proclaimed king and the island renamed Tenedos in his honor. When Cycnus realized the lie behind the allegations he took a ship to apologize to his son. The myths differ on whether they reconciled. According to one version, when the father landed on the island of Tenedos, Tenes cut the cord holding his boat. The phrase &#x27;hatchet of Tenes&#x27; came to mean resentment that could not be soothed. Another myth had Achilles landing on Tenedos, while sailing from Aulis to Troy. There his navy stormed the island, and Achilles fought Tenes, in this myth a son of Apollo, and killed him, not knowing Tenes&#x27;s lineage and hence unaware of the danger of Apollo&#x27;s revenge. Achilles would also later kill Tenes&#x27;s father, Cycnus, at Troy. In Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, written in 409 BC, a serpent bit Philoctetes in the foot at Tenedos. According to Hyginus, the goddess Hera, upset with Philoctetes for helping Hercules, had sent the snake to punish him. His wound refused to heal, and the Greeks abandoned him, before going back to him for help later during the attack on Troy. Athenaeus quoted Nymphodorus&#x27;s remarks on the beauty of the women of Tenedos.

Callimachus talked of a myth in which Ino&#x27;s son Melikertes washed up dead in Tenedos after being thrown into the sea by his mother, who killed herself too; the residents, Lelegians, built an altar for Melikertes and started a ritual of a woman sacrificing her infant child when the town&#x27;s need was dire. The woman would then be blinded. The myths also added that the custom was abolished when Orestes&#x27; descendants settled the place.

Neoptolemus stayed two days at Tenedos, following the advice of Thetis, before he go to the land of the Molossians together with Helenus.

===Archaic period===
It was at Tenedos, along with Lesbos, that the first coins with Greek writing on them were minted. Figures of bunches of grapes and wine vessels such as amphorae and kantharoi were stamped on coins. The very first coins had a twin head of a male and a female on the obverse side. The early coins were of silver and had a double-headed axe imprinted on them. Aristotle considered the axe as symbolizing the decapitation of those convicted of adultery, a Tenedian decree. The axe-head was either a religious symbol or the seal of a trade unit of currency. Apollo Smintheus, a god who both protected against and brought about plague, was worshipped in late Bronze Age Tenedos. Strabo&#x27;s Geography writes that Tenedos &quot;contains an Aeolian city and has two harbours, and a temple of Apollo Smintheus&quot; (Strabo&#x27;s Geography, Vol. 13). The relationship between Tenedos and Apollo is mentioned in Book I of the Iliad where a priest calls to Apollo with the name &quot;O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might&quot;(&quot;Iliad&quot; I).

During the later part of the Bronze Age and during the Iron Age, the place served as a major point between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; mentions the Tenedos of this era. The culture and artisanship of the area, as represented by pottery and metal vessels recovered from graves, matched that of the northeastern Aegean. Archaeologists have found no evidence to substantiate Herodotus&#x27;s assertion Aeolians had settled in Tenedos by the Bronze Age. Homer mentions Tenedos as a base for the Achaean fleet during the Trojan war.

The Iron Age settlement of the northeast Aegean was once attributed to Aeolians, descendants of Orestes and hence of the House of Atreus in Mycenae, from across the Aegean from Thessaly, Boiotia and Akhaia, all in mainland Greece. Pindar, in his 11th Nemean Ode, hints at a group of Peloponnesians, the children of the fighters at Troy, occupying Tenedos, with Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, landing straight on the island; specifically he refers to a Spartan Peisandros and his descendant Aristagoras, with Peisandaros having come over with Orestes. Strabo places the start of the migration sixty years after the Trojan war, initiated by Orestes&#x27;s son, Penthilos, with the colonization continuing onto Penthilos&#x27;s grandson.

The archaeological record provides no supporting evidence for the theory of Aiolian occupation. During the pre-archaic period, adults in Lesbos were buried by placing them in large jars, and later clay coverings were used, similar to Western Asia Minor. Still later, Tenedians began to both bury and cremate their adults in pits buttressed with stone along the walls. Children were still buried covered in jars. Some items buried with the person, such as pottery, gifts and safety-pin-like clasps, resemble what is found in Anatolia, in both style and drawings and pictures, more than they resemble burial items in mainland Greece.

While human, specifically infant, sacrifice has been mentioned in connection with Tenedos&#x27;s ancient past, it is now considered mythical in nature. The hero Paleomon in Tenedos was worshipped by a cult in that island, and the sacrifices were attributed to the cult. At Tenedos, people did sacrifice a newborn calf dressed in buskins, after treating the cow like a pregnant women giving birth; the person who killed the calf was then stoned and driven out into a life on the sea. According to Harold Willoughby, a belief in the calf as a ritual incarnation of God drove this practice.

=== Classical period ===
From the Archaic to Classical period, the archaeological evidence of well-stocked graves establishes Tenedos&#x27;s continuing affluence. Tall, broad-mouthed containers show grapes and olives were likely processed during this time. They were also used to bury dead infants. By the fourth century BC, grapes and wine had become relevant to the economy of the island. Tenedians likely exported surplus wine. Writings from this era talk of a shortage of agricultural land, indicating a booming settlement. A dispute with the neighboring island of Sigeum was arbitrated by Periander of Corinth, who handed over political control of a swath of the mainland to Tenedos. In the first century BC this territory was eventually incorporated into Alexandria Troas.

According to some accounts, Thales of Greece died in Tenedos. Cleostratus, an astronomer, lived and worked in Tenedos, though it is unknown whether he met Thales there. Cleostratus is one of the founders of Greek astronomy, influenced as it was by the reception of Babylonian knowledge. Athens had a naval base on the island in the fifth and fourth century BC. Demosthenes mentions Apollodorus, a trierarch commanding a ship, talking of buying food during a stopover at Tenedos where he would pass the trierarchy to Polycles. In 493 BCE, the Persians overran Tenedos along with other Greek islands. During his reign, Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, sent a Macedonian force sailing against the Persian fleet. Along with other Aegean islands such as Lesbos, Tenedos also rebelled against the Persian dominance at this time. Athens seemingly augmented its naval base with a fleet at the island around 450 BC.

During the campaign of Alexander the Great against the Persians, Pharnabazus, the Persian commander, laid siege to Tenedos with a hundred ships and eventually captured it as Alexander could not send a fleet in time to save the island. The island&#x27;s walls were demolished and the islanders had to accept the old treaty with the Persian emperor Artaxerxes II: the Peace of Antalcidas. Later, Alexander&#x27;s commander Hegelochus of Macedon captured the island from the Persians. Alexander made an alliance with the people in Tenedos in order to limit the Persian naval power. He also took on board 3000 Greek mercenaries and oarsmen from Tenedos in his army and navy.

The land was not suitable for large-scale grazing or extensive agriculture. Local grapes and wines were mentioned in inscriptions and on coins. But Pliny and other contemporary writers did not mention grapes and wines at the island. Most exports were via sea, and both necessities and luxuries had to imported, again by sea. Unlike in Athens, it is unclear whether Tenedos ever had a democracy. Marjoram (Oregano) from Tenedos was one of the relishes used in Greek cuisine.
The Tenedians punished adulterers by cutting off their heads with an axe. Aristotle wrote about the social and political structure of Tenedos. He found it notable a large part of the populace worked in occupations related to ferries, possibly hundreds in a population of thousands. Pausanias noted some common proverbs in Greek originated from customs of the Tenedians. &quot;He is a man of Tenedos&quot; was used to allude to a person of unquestionable integrity, and &quot;to cut with the Tenedian axe&quot; was a full and final &#x27;no&#x27;. Lykophron, writing in the second century BC, referred to the deity Melikertes as the &quot;baby-slayer&quot;. Xenophon described the Spartans&#x27; sacking the place in 389 BC, but being beaten back by an Athenian fleet when trying again two years later.

The &quot;Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax&quot; states that the astronomer Kleostratos () was from Tenedos.

=== Hellenistic period ===
In the Hellenistic period, the Egyptian goddess Isis was also worshipped at Tenedos. There she was associated closely with the sun, with her name and title reflecting that position.

=== Roman period ===
During the Roman occupation of Greece, Tenedos too came under their rule. The island became a part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC, when Attalus III, the king of Pergamon, died, leaving his territory to the Romans. The Romans constructed a new port at Alexandria Troas, on the Dardanelle Strait. This led to Tenedos&#x27;s decline. Tenedos lost its importance during this period. Virgil, in &quot;Aeneid&quot;, stated the harbour was deserted and ships could not moor in the bay during his time. Processing of grapes seems to have been abandoned. Olive cultivation and processing did possibly continue, though there was likely no surplus to export. Archaeological evidence indicates the settlement was mostly in the town, with only a few scattered sites in the countryside.

According to Strabo there was a kinship between the peoples of Tenedos and Tenea (a town at Corinth).

According to Cicero a number of deified human beings were worshipped in Greece: in Tenedos there was Tenes.

Pausanias, mention at his work Description of Greece that Periklyto, who was from Tenedos, has dedicated some axes at Delphoi.

During the Third Mithridatic War, in around 73 BC, Tenedos was the site of a large naval battle between Roman commander Lucullus and the fleet of the king of Pontus, Mithridates, commanded by Neoptolemus. This Battle of Tenedos was won decisively by the Romans. Around 81–75 BC, Verres, legate of the Governor of Cilicia, Gaius Dolabella, plundered the island, carrying off the statue of Tenes and some money. Towards 6 BC, geographical change made the mainland port less useful, and Tenedos became relevant again. According to Dio Chrysostom and Plutarch, Tenedos was famous for its pottery ca AD 100. Under Rome&#x27;s protection, Tenedos restarted its mint after a break of more than a century. The mint continued with the old designs, improving on detail and precision. Cicero, writing in this era, noted the temple built to honor Tenes, the founder whose name the island received, and of the harsh justice system of the populace.

=== Byzantine period ===
When Constantinople became a prominent city in the Roman Empire, from AD 350 on, Tenedos became a crucial trading post. Emperor Justinian I ordered the construction of a large granary on Tenedos and ferries between the island and Constantinople became a major activity on the island. Ships carrying grain from Egypt to Constantinople stopped at Tenedos when the sea was unfavorable. The countryside was likely not heavily populated or utilized. There were vineyards, orchards and corn fields, at times abandoned due to disputes.

The Eastern Orthodox Church placed the diocese of Tenedos under the metropolitanate of Mytilini during the ninth century, and promoted it to its own metropolitanate in early fourteenth century. By this time Tenedos was part of the Byzantine Empire but its location made it a key target of the Venetians, the Genoese, and the Ottoman Empire. The weakened Byzantine Empire and wars between Genoa and Venice for trade routes made Tenedos a key strategic location. In 1304, Andrea Morisco, a Genoese adventurer, backed by a title from the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III, took over Tenedos. Later, sensing political tension in the Byzantine empire just before the Second Byzantine Civil War, the Venetians offered 20,000 ducats in 1350 to John V Palaiologos for control of Tenedos. When John V was captured in the Byzantine civil war, he was deported to Tenedos by John VI Kantakouzenos.

John V eventually claimed victory in the civil war, but the cost was significant debt, mainly to the Venetians. In the summer of 1369, John V sailed to Venice and apparently offered the island of Tenedos in exchange for twenty-five thousand ducats and his own crown jewels. However, his son (Andronikos IV Palaiologos), acting as the regent in Constantinople, rejected the deal possibly because of Genoese pressure. Andronikos tried but failed to depose his father. In 1376, John V sold the island to Venice on the same terms as before. This upset the Genoese of Galata. The Genoese helped the imprisoned Andronikos to escape and depose his father. Andronikos repaid the favor ceding them Tenedos. But the garrison on the island refused the agreement and gave control over to the Venetians.

The Venetians established an outpost on the island, a move that caused significant tension with the Byzantine Empire (then represented by Andronikos IV)and the Genoese. In the Treaty of Turin, which ended the War of Chioggia between Venice and Genoa, the Venetians were to hand over control of the island to Amadeo of Savoy and the Genoese were to pay the bill for the removal of all fortifications on the island. The Treaty of Turin specified that the Venetians would destroy all the island&#x27;s &quot;castles, walls, defences, houses and habitations from top to bottom &#x27;in such fashion that the place can never be rebuilt or reinhabited&quot;. The Greek populace was not a party to the negotiations, but were to be paid for being uprooted. The baillie of Tenedos, Zanachi Mudazzo, refused to evacuate the place, and the Doge of Venice, Antonio Venier, protested the expulsion. The senators of Venice reaffirmed the treaty, the proposed solution of handing the island back to the Emperor seen as unacceptable to the Genoese. Toward the end of 1383, the population of almost 4000 was shipped out to Euboea and Crete. Buildings on the island were then razed leaving it empty. Venetians continued to use the harbor.

The Venetians were zealous guarding the right to Tenedos the Treaty of Turin provided them. The Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes wanted to build a fortification at the island in 1405, with the knights bearing the cost, but the Venetians refused to allow this. The island remained largely uninhabited for the next decades. When Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo visited the island in 1403 he remarked that because of the Treaty of Turin &quot;Tenedos has since come to be uninhabited.&quot; 29 May 1416 saw the first battle at sea between the Venetians and the emerging Ottoman fleet at Gallipoli. The Venetian captain-general, Pietro Loredan, won, wiped out the Turks on board, and retired down the coast to Tenedos, where he killed all the non-Turk prisoners who had voluntarily joined the Turks. In the treaty of 1419 between Sultan Mehmed and the Venetians, Tenedos was the dividing line beyond which the Turkish fleet was not to advance. Spanish adventurer Pedro Tafur visited the island in 1437 and found it deserted, with many rabbits, the vineyards covering the island in disrepair, but the port well-maintained. He mentioned frequent Turkish attacks on shipping in the harbor. In 1453, the port was used by the commander of a single-ship Venetian fleet, Giacomo Loredan, as a monitoring point to observe the Turkish fleet, on his way to Constantinople in what would become the final defense of that city against the Turks.

===Ottoman period===

Tenedos was occupied by Sultan Mehmet II in 1455, two years after his Conquest of Constantinople ending the Byzantine empire. It became the first island controlled by the Ottoman Empire in the Aegean sea. The island was still uninhabited at that time, almost 75 years after it had been forcefully evacuated. Mehmet II rebuilt the island&#x27;s fort. During his reign the Ottoman navy used the island as a supply base. The Venetians, realizing the strategic importance of the island, deployed forces on it. Giacopo Loredano took Tenedos for Venice in 1464. The same year, Ottoman Admiral Mahmud Pasha recaptured the island. During the Ottoman regime, the island was repopulated (by granting a tax exemption). The Ottoman fleet admiral and cartographer, Piri Reis, in his book &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;, completed in 1521, included a map of the shore and the islands off it, marking Tenedos as well. He noted that ships heading north from Smyrna to the Dardanelles passed usually through the seven-mile strip of sea between the island and the mainland.

Tommaso Morosini of Venice set out with 23 ships from Crete on 20 March 1646, heading to Istanbul. They stopped at Tenedos, but failed to establish a foothold there when their ship caught fire, killing many of the crew. In 1654, Hozam Ali of the Turkish fleet landed at the island, gathering Turkish forces for a naval battle against the Venetians. This, the Battle of the Dardanelles (1654), the first of four in a series, the Ottomans won. After the Battle of the Dardanelles in 1656, Barbaro Badoer of the Venetians seized the island on 8 July. The Ottoman defeat weakened its Sultan Mehmed IV, then aged 16, and strengthened the Grand Vizier, Köprülü Mehmed Pasha.

In March 1657, an Ottoman Armada emerged through the Dardanelles, slipping through a Venetian blockade, with the objective of retaking the island but did not attempt to do so, concerned by the Venetian fleet. In July 1657, Köprülü made a decision to break the Venetian blockade and retake the territory. The Peace Party in the Venetian senate thought it best to not defend Tenedos, and Lemnos, and debated this with the War Party. Köprülü ended the argument by recapturing Tenedos on 31 August 1657, in the Battle of the Dardanelles (1657), the fourth and final one.

Following the victory, the Grand Vizier visited the island and oversaw its repairs, during which he funded construction of a mosque, which was to be called by his name. According to the Mosque&#x27;s Foundation&#x27;s book, it was built on the site of an older mosque, called Mıhçı Mosque which was destroyed during Venetian occupation. By the time Köprülü died in September 1661, he had built on the island the businesses of a coffee-house, a bakery, 84 shops, and nine mills; a watermill; two mosques; a school; a rest stop for travelers and a stable; and a bath-house.

Rabbits which drew the attention of Tafur two-and-a-half centuries ago were apparently still abundant in the mid 17th century. In 1659 the traveler Evliya Çelebi was sent to the island with the task of collecting game for the Sultan Mehmed IV. The disorder of the 1600s hampered supply lines and caused grain shortages in Bozcaada.

As a result of the series of setbacks Ottomans faced in Rumelia during the later years of the reign of Mehmed IV, with the Grand Vizier being Sarı Süleyman Pasha, the forces at the island are reported to have mutinied in 1687 with parts of the rest of the army. These widespread mutinies would result in the deposing of the Sultan and the Grand Vizier that year.

In 1691 the Venetians and allies formed a war council to discuss retaking the island. The council met regularly at the galley of Domenico Mocenigo, the captain-general of the Venetian fleet. By this time, the only people on the island were those in the fort. Mocenigo estimated their number to be around 300, and the fort to be weakly buttressed. On 17 July 1691 the war council met off the waters of the island and decided to retake Tenedos since it was, per their estimate, weakly defended but famous. As a first step they decided to gather information. At their next meeting, six days later, they learned from captured slaves that the Turkish garrison, numbering around 3000, had drug trenches and strengthened their defenses. The plan to retake the island was abandoned. Venetians would try to capture Tenedos unsuccessfully in 1697.

The Peace of Karlowitz, which for the first time brought the Ottomans into the mainstream of European diplomacy, was signed on 26 January 1699 by the Ottomans, the Venetians, and a large number of Europeans powers. The Venetian senate sent its ambassador, Soranzo to Istanbul via Tenedos. At the island he was greeted with a royal reception of cannon fire and by the Pasha of the island himself.

During the classical Ottoman period, the island was a kadiluk. The Ottomans built mosques, fountains, hammams, and a medrese. The Ottomans adopted the Byzantine practice of using islands as places for the internal exile of state prisoners, such as Constantine Mourousis and Halil Hamid Pasha. In October 1633, Cyril Contari, Metropolitan of Aleppo in the Orthodox Church, was made the patriarch after promising to pay the Ottoman central authority 50,000 dollars. His inability to pay led to his being exiled to the island for a short time.

In 1807, a joint fleet of the Russians and British captured the island during the Russo-Turkish Wars, with the Russians using it as their military base to achieve the victories at the Dardanelles and Athos; but they ceded control as part of the Treaty of Armistice with the Ottoman Porte. However, the Russian occupations proved to be destructive for the island. The town was burnt down, the harbor was almost filled in and almost all buildings were destroyed. The islanders fled and Tenedos became deserted once more.

In 1822, during the Greek War of Independence, the revolutionaries under Konstantinos Kanaris managed to attack an Ottoman fleet and burn one of its ships off Tenedos. This event was a major morale booster for the Greek Revolution and attracted the attention of the European Powers. The trees that covered the island were destroyed during the war.

During the 19th century, the wine production remained a profitable business while the island&#x27;s annual wheat production was only enough for three months of the islanders&#x27; consumption. Apart from wine, the only export item of the island was a small quantity of wool. Also in the 19th century there had been attempts to introduce pear, fig and mulberry trees. However, there are reports of fruit, especially fig trees being present on the island prior to those attempts.

The 1852 law of the Tanzimat reorganized Turkish islands and Tenedos ended up in the sanjak of Bosje Adassi (Bozcaada), in the Vilayet Jazaǐri. In July 1874, a fire destroyed the place. In 1876, a middle school was added to those on the island, with 22 students and teaching Turkish, Arabic and Persian. By 1878, the island had 2015 males, of whom almost a quarter were Muslim, in around 800 houses. The place also hosted a company of the Ottoman foot-artillery division, along with an Austrian and French vice-consulate. The island was in the sanjak of Bigha, which seated a General Governor. Around 500 casks of gunpowder, left behind by the Russians in a military storehouse, were still there. The fort accommodated the Turkish military camp, a grain silo and two wells.

In 1854, there were some 4,000 inhabitants on the island of Tenedos, of which one-third were Turks. Also, there was only one Greek school on the island with about 200 students.

According to the Ottoman general census of 1893, the population of the island was divided as follows: 2,479 Greeks, 1,247 Turks, 103 Foreign Nationals and 6 Armenians.

By the early 20th century, the island, still under the Turks, had around 2000 people living in wooden houses with gardens. The port provided shelter for ships from the violent northerly winds. The British had a vice consul at the island. The town served as a telegraph station, with an Austrian ship coming in every two weeks. In 1906 the town imports were at 17, 950 liras and exports, mainly wine and raisins, worth 6,250 liras. There were telegraph cables laid in the sea near the port.

===Between Turkey and Greece===

==== 1912–1921 ====
During the First Balkan War, on 20 October 1912, Tenedos was the first island of the north Aegean that came under the control of the Greek Navy. The Turks that constituted part of Tenedos&#x27; population did not welcome the Greek control. By taking over the islands in the Northern Aegean sea, the Greek Navy limited the ability of the Ottoman fleet to move through the Dardanelles. Greek administration of the island lasted until 12 November 1922.

Negotiations to end the Balkan war started in December 1912 in London and the issue of the Aegean islands was one persistent problem. The issue divided the great powers with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy supporting the Ottoman position for return of all the Aegean islands and Britain and France supporting the Greek position for Greek control of all the Aegean islands. With Italy controlling key islands in the region, major power negotiations deadlocked in London and later in Bucharest. Romania threatened military action with the Greeks against the Ottomans in order to force negotiations in Athens in November 1913. Eventually, Greece and the United Kingdom pressured the Germans to support an agreement where the Ottomans would retain Tenedos, Kastelorizo and Imbros and the Greeks would control the other Aegean islands. The Greeks accepted the plan while the Ottoman Empire rejected the ceding of the other Aegean islands. This agreement would not hold, but the outbreak of World War I and the Turkish War of Independence put the issue to the side.

During the World War I Gallipoli Campaign, the British used the island as a supply base and built a 600 m long airstrip for military operations.

After the Turkish War of Independence ended in Greek defeat in Anatolia, and the fall of Lloyd George and his Middle Eastern policies, the western powers agreed to the Treaty of Lausanne with the new Turkish Republic, in 1923. This treaty made Tenedos and Imbros part of Turkey, and it guaranteed a special autonomous administrative status there to accommodate the local Greek population. The treaty excluded the Orthodox Christians on the islands from the population exchange that took place between Greece and Turkey. Article 14 of the treaty provided specific guarantees safeguarding the rights of minorities in both the nations.

In 1912, when the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople conducted its own census, the population of the island was estimated to be: 5,420 Greeks and 1,200 Turks.

==== 1922 and later ====

Greece returned the island to Turkey in 1922. The inhabitants, substantially Greek Orthodox, were exempt from compulsory expulsion per the Lausanne Treaty&#x27;s article 14, paragraph 2. Despite the treaty, the state of international relations between Greece and Turkey, wider world issues, and domestic pressures influenced how the Greek minority of Tenedos was treated. Acting reciprocally with Greece, Turkey made systematic attempts to evacuate the Greeks on the isle. Turkey never implemented either the Article 14 guarantee of some independence for the place in local rules, or the Article 39 guarantee to Turkish citizens, of all ethnicities, of the freedom to choose the language they wanted to use in their daily lives.

In early 1926, conscripts and reservists of the army from Tenedos were transported to Anatolia. Great panic was engendered, and Greek youths fearing oppression fled the island. Others, who tried to hide in the mountains, were soon discovered and moved to Anatolia.

Turkish law 1151 in 1927 specifically put administration of the islands in the hands of the Turkish government and not local populations, outlawed schooling in the Greek language and closed the Greek schools. According to the official Turkish census, in 1927 there were 2,500 Greeks and 1,247 Turks on the island.

The Greco-Turkish rapprochement of 1930, which marks a significant turning point in the relations of the two countries, helped Tenedos reap some benefits too. In September 1933, moreover, certain islanders who had emigrated to America were allowed to return to and settle in their native land. Responding to the Greek good will over the straits, Turkey permitted the regular election of a local Greek mayor and seven village elders as well as a number of local employees.

In the 1950s, tension between Greece and Turkey eased and law 1151/1927 was abolished and replaced by law no. 5713 in 1951, according to the law regular Greek language classes were added to the curriculum of the schools on Tenedos. Also, as restriction of travel to the island was relaxed, a growing number of Greek tourists from Istanbul and abroad visited Tenedos. These tourists did not only bring much needed additional revenues, but they also put an end to the twenty-seven-year long isolation of the islands from the outside world.

However, when tensions increased in 1963 over Cyprus, the Turkish government again invoked a ban against Greek language education, and appropriated community property held by Greeks on the island. In 1964 Turkey closed the Greek-speaking schools on the island again. Furthermore, with the 1964 Law On Land Expropriation (No 6830) the farm property of the Greeks on the island was taken away from their owners. These policies, better economic options elsewhere, presence of a larger Greek community in Greece, fear and pressure, resulted in an exodus of the Greek population from the isle. The migrants retain Turkish citizenship but their descendants are not entitled to it. Greeks who left the island in the 1960s, often sold their properties, at particularly low prices, to their Turkish neighbours, which reflected the situation of duress under which they had to leave.

In 1992, the Human Rights Watch report concluded that the Turkish government has denied the rights of the Greek community on Imbros and Tenedos in violation of the Lausanne Treaty and international human rights laws and agreements.

In recent years there has been some progress in the relations between the different religious groups on the islands. In 2005, a joint Greek and Turkish delegation visited Tenedos and later that year Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited the island. After that visit, the Turkish government funded the restoration of the bell tower of the Orthodox Church in Tenedos (built originally in 1869). In 1925 the Orthodox church became part of the Metropolis of Imbros and Tenedos. Cyril Dragounis has been its bishop since 2002. In 2009, the Foundation of the Bozcaada Koimisis Theotokou Greek Orthodox Church won a judgement in the European Court of Human Rights for recognition and financial compensation over their degraded cemetery.

=== Turkish rule ===

Turkey continued the old practice of exiling people to the island. The Democratic Party exiled Kemal Pilavoğlu, the leader of a religious sect, &quot;Ticani&quot;, to Tenedos for life, for sacrilege against Atatürk. Foreigners were prohibited from visiting the islands until the 1990s. However, in the mid-1990s, the Turkish government financially supported the expansion of wineries and tourist opportunities on the island. Today the island is a growing summer tourist location for wine enthusiasts and others.

Since 2011 an annual half marathon has been run on the island.

===Proverbs of ancient Greeks regarding the island===

Greeks used the proverb &quot;Tenedian human&quot; () in reference to those with frightening appearance, because when Tenes laid down laws at the island he stipulated that a man with an axe should stand behind the judge and strike the man being convicted after he had spoken in vain. 
In addition, they used the proverb &quot;Tenedian advocate&quot; (), meaning a harsh advocate. There are many explanations regarding this proverb. Some say because the Tenedians honor two axes in their dedications. Aristotle said because a Tenedian king used to try lawsuits with an axe, so that he could execute wrongdoers on the spot, or because there was a place in Tenedos called Asserina, where there was a small river in which crabs have shell which was like an axe, or because a certain king laid down a law that adulterers should both be beheaded, and he observed this in the case of his son. Others said because of what Tenes suffered at the hands of his stepmother, he used to judge homicide suits with an axe.

==Population==


In 1854, there were some 4,000 inhabitants on the island of Bozcaada, of which one-third were Turks. According to the Ottoman general census of 1893, the population of the island was divided as follows: 2,479 Greeks, 1,247 Turks, 103 Foreign Nationals and 6 Armenians. In 1912, when the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople conducted its own census, the population of the island was estimated to be: 5,420 Greeks and 1,200 Turks. In 1927, according to the official Turkish census, there were 2,500 Greeks and 1,247 Turks on the island.

By 2000, the official count of ethnic Greeks permanently residing on the island had dropped to 22. As of 2022, Bozcaada&#x27;s population was 3,120. During summer, many more visit the island, ballooning its population to over 10,000 people. Historically the Turkish &quot;mahalle&quot; (quarter) has been located to the south and the Greek one to the north. Each quarter has its own religious institutions, mosques on the Turkish side and churches on the Greek side. The Greek quarter was burned to the ground in the fire of 1874 and rebuilt, while the Turkish quarter has an older design. The houses are architecturally different in the two districts. The grid-planned Greek district has businesses, galleries and hotels. This district is dominated by the bell tower of the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God. On 26 July every year, the Greeks gather here to eat, dance and celebrate the feast day of St. Paraskevi.

The Turkish quarter has largely houses. The district, in its present version, dates to 1702, and contains the grave of a grand vizier, Halil Hamid Pasha. Pasha was executed on Tenedos after being exiled for scheming to replace sultan Abdülhamid I, with the &quot;șehzade&quot; (crown prince) Selim, the future Sultan. The grave is in the courtyard of the Alaybey Mosque, a historical monument. Another mosque, Köprülü Mehmet Paşa Mosque (also called Yali Mosque), is also a monument. The Turkish district, Alaybey, also has hammams and the Namazgah fountain.

The island has native islanders from families who have lived on the island for centuries, new wealthy immigrants from Istanbul, and wage labor immigrants from mainland Anatolia, especially Romani people in Turkey from Bayramiç.

==Economy==
Traditional economic activities are fishing and wine production. The remainder of arable land is covered by olive trees and wheat fields. Most of the agriculture is done on the central plains and gentle hills of the island. Red poppies of the island are used to produce small quantities of sharbat and jam. Sheep and goats are grazed at hilly northeastern and southeastern part of the island which is not suitable for agriculture. The number of farmers involved in grape cultivation has gone up from 210 to 397 in the recent years, though the farm area has gone down from to .

Tourism has been an important, but limited, economic activity since the 1970s but it developed rapidly from the 1990s onwards. The island&#x27;s main attraction is the castle last rebuilt in 1815, illuminated at night, and with a view out to the open sea. The island&#x27;s past is captured in a small museum, with a room dedicated to its Greek story. The town square boasts a &quot;morning market&quot; where fresh groceries and seafood are sold, along with the island&#x27;s specialty of tomato jam. Mainlanders from Istanbul run some bars, boutiques and guesthouses. In 2010, the island was named the world&#x27;s second most-beautiful island by Condé Nast&#x27;s Reader Choice award. The next year, the island topped the reader&#x27;s list in the same magazine for the top 10 islands in Europe. In 2012, Condé Nast again selected Bozcaada as one of the 8 best islands in the world on account of its remnants of ancient buildings, less-crowded beaches, and places to stay.

Fishing plays a role in the island&#x27;s economy, but similar to other Aegean islands, agriculture is a more significant economic activity. The local fishing industry is small, with the port authority counting 48 boats and 120 fishermen in 2011. Local fishing is year-round and seafood can be obtained in all seasons. The fish population has gone down over the years, resulting in a shrinking fishing industry, though increase in tourism and consequent demand for more seafood has benefited the industry. The sea off the island is one of the major routes by which fish in the Aegean sea migrate seasonally. During the migration period, boats from the outside come to the island for fishing.

In 2000, a wind farm of 17 turbines was erected at the western cape. It has a nominal power capacity of 10.2 MW energy, and produces 30 GWh of electricity every year. This is much more than what the island needs, and the excess is transferred to mainland Anatolia through an underground and partly undersea cable. Overhead cables and pylons were avoided for esthetic reasons, preserving the scenic view. The land has an average wind speed of 6.4 m/s and a mean energy density of 324 W/mat its meteorological station. This indicates significant wind energy generation potential.

A United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) project, the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies (ICHET) set up an experimental renewables-hydrogen energy facility at the Bozcaada Governor&#x27;s building on 7 October 2011. The project, supported by the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR), is the first of its kind in the country. The power plant produces energy via a 20 kW solar photovoltaic array, and uses a 50 kW electrolyzer to store this energy as hydrogen. A fuel cell and hydrogen engine can convert this stored energy back into electricity when needed, and the experimental system can supply up to 20 households for a day.

, the town&#x27;s hospital and governor&#x27;s mansion were the only two buildings in the world using hydrogen energy. A boat and a golf cart are also powered by the same system. At the governor&#x27;s place, energy is captured with a rooftop 20 Kw solar array and a 30 Kw wind mill. The electricity produced is used to electrolyze water into hydrogen. This gas is stored compressed, and can be used later to generate energy or as fuel in hydrogen-powered cars. In June 2011, Henry Puna, the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands traveled to Tenedos to investigate how the island uses hydrogen energy.

In 2012, the Turkish government opened a customs office on the island, possibly opening the way for future direct travel between Greek ports and the island.

==Wine production==
The island is windy throughout the year and this makes the climate dry and warm enough to grow grapes. In classical antiquity wine production was linked with the cult of Dionysus, while grapes were also depicted in the local currency. The local wine culture outlived the Ottoman period. Vineyards have existed on the island since antiquity and today occupy one-third of the total land of the island and 80% of its agricultural land, In the mid-1800s, the island exported 800,000 barrels of wine annually and was revered as the best wine in the Eastern Mediterranean. Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi wrote in the 16th century that the finest wines in the world were being produced in Tenedos. Today, the island is one of the major wine producing areas in Turkey and grows four local strains of grape: Çavuş, Karasakız (Kuntra), Altınbaş (Vasilaki), and Karalahna. However, in recent years traditional French varieties have increased in prominence, namely Cabernet Sauvignon.

Prior to 1923, wine production on the island was exclusively done by the Greek population; however, after this point, Turkish domestic wine production increased and Greeks on the island taught the Turkish population how to manufacture wine. By 1980, there were 13 wine production plants on the island. High taxes caused many of these to go out of business until 2001 when the state decreased taxes on wine and subsidized some of the producers on the island. In recent years, newer producers have relied upon Italian and French experts to improve production. In 2010, the island produced a record 5,000 tons of wine. Corvus has introduced modern wine making techniques to Tenedos. Grape harvest festivities are held the first week of September annually.

==Transportation==

The main transportation from mainland Turkey is by ferries from Geyikli and from the town of Çanakkale. The island is roughly from mainland Turkey. From the Geyikli pier, ferry travel is available for both passengers and automobiles, and takes about 35 minutes. A passenger-only ferry service from Çanakkale began running in 2009. Both run less often during the winter months. The island is seven hours by bus and then ferry from Istanbul. In 2012, Seabird Airlines began offering flights from Istanbul&#x27;s Golden Horn to the island.

==Culture==
The Turkish film &quot;Akıllı Köpek Max&quot; (Max the Smart Dog) was filmed in Bozcaada in 2012. Another Turkish film, &quot;Bi Küçük Eylül Meselesi&quot; (A Small September Affair) was filmed on the island in 2013.

The Australian author Dmetri Kakmi was born on Tenedos of Greek parents in 1961. His acclaimed memoir Mother Land about his childhood on the island was published in 2008 and reissued in a new edition in 2015.

<doc id="575978" wikidata="Q637949" url="?curid=575978" title="Alphonso Taft">
<text>Alphonso Taft (November 5, 1810 – May 21, 1891) was an American jurist, diplomat, and politician who served as United States Attorney General and Secretary of War under President Ulysses S. Grant. He was also the founder of the Taft political dynasty, and father of Congressman Charles Phelps Taft and President William Howard Taft.

As Secretary of War, Taft&#x27;s popular appointment by Grant did much to restore the integrity of the War Department. Taft reformed the War Department by allowing commanders at Indian forts to choose who could start and run post traderships, and by making reductions in wasteful military spending. While serving as Attorney General, he strongly held that African Americans must not be denied the right to vote through intimidation and violence. Attorney General Taft coauthored a bill to Congress, signed into law by President Grant, that created the Elections Commission that settled the controversial Hayes-Tilden presidential election.

Taft was appointed as minister to Austria-Hungary by Chester A. Arthur in 1882. He served until July 4, 1884, and was then transferred by President Arthur to Minister of Russia, and he served in St. Petersburg until August 1885. Taft had a reputation for serving political office with integrity and character. Taft was a rare and modern 19th century politician who supported black voting rights and who reduced government corruption while holding office.

==Early life==
Alphonso Taft was born in Townshend, Vermont, the only child of Peter Rawson Taft of the powerful Taft family, and Sylvia Howard, on November 5, 1810. He was descended from Robert Taft Sr. who had migrated to America from County Louth, Ireland. His mother Sylvia was either of Scottish or Irish descent. While the Taft family was of substance and education, they were not considered wealthy. Taft attended local schools until the age of sixteen. He then taught school to earn money to attend Amherst Academy. During his time at Amherst, he and Samuel Colt stole a cannon belonging to General Ebenezer Mattoon and shot it at their school. Taft entered Yale College in 1829 and he graduated four years later in 1833. Taft helped create the secret society known as Skull and Bones in 1832 with William Huntington Russell.

Upon graduation, again to earn money, Taft was an instructor at Ellington, Connecticut, from 1835 to 1837. He subsequently studied law at the Yale Law School and was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1838. While studying law Taft held a tutorship at Yale. Taft had no desire to remain in New England, and he stated to his father Peter in a letter written on July 22, 1837, that Vermont was a &quot;noble state to emigrate from.&quot; Taft did not want to practice law in New York because he believed people were under the corrupting influence of wealth. In 1839 Taft migrated to Cincinnati where he was a member of the Cincinnati City Council, and became one of the most influential citizens of Ohio. He was a member of the boards of trustees of the University of Cincinnati, Antioch College, and Yale College.

==Marriages, family, and estate==
Alphonso Taft was married twice. In 1841 he married Fanny Phelps (born 1823), daughter of Judge Charles Phelps, and they had five children, three of whom died in infancy:
*Charles Phelps Taft (December 21, 1843 – December 31, 1929)
*Peter Rawson Taft II (May 10, 1846 – June 3, 1889)
*Mary Taft (November 24, 1848 – November 29, 1848)
*Alphonso Taft (May 12, 1850 – March 2, 1851)
*Alphonso Taft (December 22, 1851 – June 22, 1852)

Fanny Taft died on June 2, 1852, twenty days before her last child&#x27;s death. On December 26, 1853, Taft married Louisa Maria (née Torrey) (born 1827), his fourth cousin twice removed, and the daughter of Samuel Davenport Torrey, of Millbury, Massachusetts. They also had five children, one of whom died in infancy:

*Samuel Davenport Taft (February 7, 1855 – April 8, 1856)
*William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930)
*Henry Waters Taft (May 27, 1859 – August 11, 1945)
*Horace Dutton Taft (December 28, 1861 – January 28, 1943)
*Frances Louise &quot;Fanny&quot; Taft (July 18, 1865 – January 4, 1950)

The estate of Alphonso Taft and his family, in Mount Auburn, one mile north of downtown Cincinnati, has been restored to its original appearance. It is open to the public and is now called the William Howard Taft National Historic Site.

== Cincinnati attorney and career ==
In 1845, Taft is credited with drafting what is still considered, the world&#x27;s longest lease, a 10,000 year lease to be exact for the Mercantile Library of Cincinnati. In 1845, the library burned down and its members raised $10,000 to contribute to the rebuilding effort. In exchange for the monetary contribution from its members, Alphonso Taft using his legal prowess, as well as his sense of humor negotiated the 10,000 year lease from which the library was able to lease their space, and it also included a stipulation that the lease could be renewed. Alphonso Taft formed a law firm with Thomas Marshall Key and William M. Dickson in April 1854. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1856, and also that year made an unsuccessful run for the United States House of Representatives against George H. Pendleton. Taft supported the Union during the Civil War. He was a judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati from 1866 to 1872 when he resigned to practice law with two of his sons. He was the first president of the Cincinnati Bar Association, serving in 1872.

In the court case &quot;Board of Education of Cincinnati vs. Minor&quot; (1872), Taft dissented against the decision made by the Superior Court of Cincinnati regarding the reading the Bible in public schools. Taft asserted that the school board was within its rights to stop the practice of reading the Bible in public schools, arguing that religious liberty demands that &quot;The government is neutral, and, while protecting all [religious sects], it prefers none, and it disparages none.&quot; Taft&#x27;s dissent helped to sway the Ohio Supreme Court, and they ruled in favor of the school board, overturning the Superior Court ruling. In his discourse, Taft specifically referenced Jewish groups opposed to the reading of the Bible in public schools. As taxpayers, Taft argued, Jews also had the right to take advantage of a public secular education. In addition, religion was a matter of the home and protected by the Bill of Rights. To suggest that the Bill of Rights only reflects Protestant values was inappropriate, according to Taft, as religious liberty was given to all religious denominations and Christianity &quot;is not to be regarded as sectarian under our constitution.&quot;

Many believe that Taft&#x27;s opinion was the cause of much opposition to him, and contributed to his 1875 loss of the Republican nomination for Governor of Ohio to Rutherford B. Hayes. However, the opinion that defeated his nomination was unanimously affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The independence of Taft&#x27;s opinion commanded widespread respect, a sentiment freely expressed when President Ulysses S. Grant in March 1876 made him Secretary of War and three months later Attorney General of the United States.

Taft was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in October 1876.

==Secretary of War==
When President Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War William W. Belknap resigned in 1876 over receiving profit money from the Fort Sill Indian tradership, Grant needed to find a replacement. Initially, Grant had Secretary George M. Robeson run both the War Department and the Navy Department. Robeson, however, had told Grant that the two Cabinet positions were difficult to manage by one person. Grant then asked Taft to be Secretary of War. With Belknap resigning in the shadow of scandal, Grant was under great pressure to find a reformer to replace him as Secretary of War. Taft had a good reputation as a lawyer and, importantly, was connected to business interests. After consultation, Taft accepted the position and was quickly confirmed by the Senate without objection, taking office on March 8, 1876. In light of what had come before, the press celebrated his appointment and confirmation.

Taft entered office with his &quot;accustomed zeal and good judgment&quot;. He made a series of reforms to the War Department to restore its reputation and entanglements caused by Belknap&#x27;s humiliating resignation. He reversed War Department policy by having commanders at U.S. military forts in the West, rather than the Secretary of War, choose who would run post trader ships. Additionally, he worked with his friend, former general and sitting Ohio congressman Henry B. Banning, to make the army more efficient. He likewise ordered his Bureau and Commandant Department heads to lower their military expenditures. The old ways of letting things go under Belknap and Robeson, it seemed, were over under Taft.

Like his predecessor Belknap, Taft was a large man, with a compact frame, who commanded military respect and admiration while he was Secretary of War.

==U.S. Attorney General==
Grant appointed Taft U.S. Attorney General after he had made a Cabinet shift by appointing Edwards Pierrepont Minister to England. Taft was replaced by J. Donald Cameron as Secretary of War. In October 1876, after the highly contested Hayes-Tilden presidential election, Attorney General Taft supported President Grant&#x27;s use of the military in South Carolina and Mississippi to suppress violence against African Americans in the South. Taft gave a lengthy speech in New York outlining the atrocities committed by Southerners against blacks in the South. In order to prevent the U.S. from fighting a second civil war, Taft supported a bill, signed into law by Grant, that peacefully settled the 1876 election with an Electoral Commission.

==Bid for office==
Taft was again an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Ohio in 1879, this time against Charles Foster.

==U.S. Minister==
Taft was appointed by President Chester A. Arthur as U.S. Minister to Austria-Hungary (1882–1884) and to Imperial Russia (1884–1885).

==Family dynasty==
Taft was a member of the Taft family political dynasty. His son, William Howard Taft, was the 27th president of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States, and was a member of Yale&#x27;s Skull and Bones like his founder father; another son, Charles Phelps Taft, supported the founding of Wolf&#x27;s Head Society at Yale; both his grandson and great-grandson, Robert A. Taft I (also Skull and Bones) and Robert Taft Jr., were U.S. Senators; his great-great-grandson, Robert A. Taft II, was the Governor of Ohio from 1999 until 2007. William Howard Taft III was ambassador to Ireland; William Howard Taft IV worked in several Republican administrations, most recently that of George W. Bush.

Alphonso Taft and his family were members of Cincinnati&#x27;s First Congregational-Unitarian Church; he served as one of the congregation&#x27;s trustees for many years, and was for a time the chairman of the board of trustees. Although government business kept him out of town and thus frequently away from the church in his later years, he remained in contact with the church&#x27;s minister on the occasions that he was able to return to Cincinnati. At a famous 1874 Taft family reunion at Elmshade, at Uxbridge, Mass., Alphonso delivered an impassioned speech on his family history and his father&#x27;s origins in this community, as recorded in his biography.

<text>Villeurbanne (; ) is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in eastern France.

It is situated northeast of Lyon, with which it forms the heart of the second-largest metropolitan area in France after that of Paris. Villeurbanne is the second-largest commune in the metropolitan area of Lyon and the 20th most populated in France, and the most populous commune that is neither a prefecture nor a sub-prefecture. In 2013, Villeurbanne was elected the city with the best administration of France, which attracts more and more people.

==History==

The current location of downtown Villeurbanne is known to have been inhabited as far back as 6000 BC. Its current name comes from a Gallo-Roman farming area, established at about the same time as Lyon (then &quot;Lugdunum&quot;) and known as the &quot;Villa Urbana&quot; (&quot;town house&quot;). It would then become &quot;Urbanum&quot;, then &quot;Villa Urbane&quot; and, ultimately, &quot;Villeurbanne&quot;.

Villeurbanne has belonged to the kingdom of France since 1349. It was then separated from La Guillotière (A former city lately incorporated into Lyon as the 3rd, 6th, 7th and 8th Arrondissement) by the river La Rize, a former branch of the Rhône River.

Until the 19th century, the city was merely a patchwork of distinct villages separated by fields and undeveloped land. These villages have mostly survived, and nowadays form the neighborhoods of Charpennes, Cusset, Croix-Luizet, Maisons-Neuves, etc.

With the industrial era, Villeurbanne&#x27;s economy soared: the textile industry was the first to bloom, followed by mechanical and chemical ones. The factories lured in numerous immigrants, most notably from Italy.

===20th century===
Transforming from a rural community to an industrial town, Villeurbanne underwent a tremendous demographic boom in the late 1920s. From 3,000 inhabitants in 1928, its population rocketed to 82,000 in 1931. Mayor Lazare Goujon (elected 1924) engaged the city in a vast public works initiative. Arguably the most visible heritage of this program is the , a housing complex made up of two Art Deco towers and annex smaller buildings, lining up along the Avenue Henri Barbusse. These structures built between 1924 and 1934 are the work of architect Môrice Leroux, with a contribution of Tony Garnier. They are one of the most notable Art Deco structures in France and the 19-story twin towers have become an emblem of the city.

The Hôtel de Ville was designed by Robert Giroud, a disciple of Tony Garnier and friend of Môrice Leroux.

<text>A divan or diwan (, &quot;dīvān&quot;; from Sumerian &quot;dub&quot;, clay tablet) was a high government ministry in various Islamic states, or its chief official (see &quot;dewan&quot;).

==Etymology==
The word, recorded in English since 1586, meaning &quot;Oriental council of a state&quot;, comes from Turkish &quot;divan&quot;, from Persian (&quot;dêvân&quot;).

It is first attested in Middle Persian spelled as &quot;dpywʾn&quot; and &quot;dywʾn&quot;, itself hearkening back, via Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian, ultimately to Sumerian &quot;dub&quot;, clay tablet. The word was borrowed into Armenian as well as &quot;divan&quot;; on linguistic grounds this is placed after the 3rd century, which helps establish the original Middle Persian (and eventually New Persian) form was &quot;dīvān&quot;, not &quot;dēvān&quot;, despite later legends that traced the origin of the word to the latter form. The variant pronunciation &quot;dēvān&quot; however did exist, and is the form surviving to this day in Tajiki Persian.

In Arabic, the term was first used for the army registers, then generalized to any register, and by metonymy applied to specific government departments. The sense of the word evolved to &quot;custom house&quot; and &quot;council chamber&quot;, then to &quot;long, cushioned seat&quot;, such as are found along the walls in Middle-Eastern council chambers. The latter is the sense that entered European languages as divan (furniture).

The modern French, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian words &quot;douane&quot;, &quot;aduana&quot;, and &quot;dogana&quot;, respectively (meaning &quot;customs house&quot;), also come from &quot;diwan&quot;.

==Creation and development under the early caliphates==
===Establishment and Umayyad period===

The first &quot;dīwān&quot; was created under Caliph Umar ( CE) in 15 A.H. (636/7 CE) or, more likely, 20 A.H. (641 CE). It comprised the names of the warriors of Medina who participated in the Muslim conquests and their families, and was intended to facilitate the payment of salary (&quot;ʿaṭāʾ&quot;, in coin or in rations) to them, according to their service and their relationship to Muhammad. This first army register (&quot;dīwān al-jund&quot;) was soon emulated in other provincial capitals like Basra, Kufa and Fustat. Al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba, a statesman from the Thaqif tribe who was versed in Persian, is credited with establishing Basra&#x27;s &quot;dīwān&quot; during his governorship (636–638), and the &quot;dīwān&quot; of the Caliphate&#x27;s other garrison centers followed its organization.

With the advent of the Umayyad Caliphate, the number of &quot;dīwāns&quot; increased. To the &quot;dīwān al-jund&quot;, the first Umayyad caliph, Mu&#x27;awiya (r. 661–680), added the bureau of the land tax (&quot;dīwān al-kharāj&quot;) in Damascus, which became the main &quot;dīwān&quot;, as well as the bureau of correspondence (&quot;dīwān al-rasāʾil&quot;), which drafted the caliph&#x27;s letters and official documents, and the bureau of the seal (&quot;dīwān al-khātam&quot;), which checked and kept copies of all correspondence before sealing and dispatching it. A number of more specialist departments were also established, probably by Mu&#x27;awiya: the &quot;dīwān al-barīd&quot; in charge of the postal service; the bureau of expenditure (&quot;dīwān al-nafaqāt&quot;), which most likely indicates the survival of a Byzantine institution; the &quot;dīwān al-ṣadaqa&quot; was a new foundation with the task of estimating the &quot;zakāt&quot; and &quot;ʿushr&quot; levies; the &quot;dīwān al-mustaghallāt&quot; administered state property in cities; the &quot;dīwān al-ṭirāz&quot; controlled the government workshops that made official banners, costumes and some furniture. Aside from the central government, there was a local branch of the &quot;dīwān al-kharāj&quot;, the &quot;dīwān al-jund&quot; and the &quot;dīwān al-rasāʾil&quot; in every province.

Under Caliph Abd al-Malik (), the practices of the various departments began to be standardized and Arabized: instead of the local languages (Greek in Syria, Coptic and Greek in Egypt, Persian in the former Sasanian lands) and the traditional practices of book-keeping, seals and time-keeping, only Arabic and the Islamic calendar were to be used henceforth. The process of Arabization was gradual: in Iraq, the transition was carried out by Salih ibn Abd al-Rahman under the auspices of the governor al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf in 697, in Syria by Sulayman ibn Sa&#x27;d al-Khushani in 700, in Egypt under Caliph al-Walid I&#x27;s governor Abdallah ibn Abd al-Malik in 706, and in Khurasan by Ishaq ibn Tulayq al-Nahshali on the orders of Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, governor of Iraq, in 741/42.

===Abbasid period===

Under the Abbasid Caliphate the administration, partly under the increasing influence of Iranian culture, became more elaborate and complex. As part of this process, the &quot;dīwāns&quot; increased in number and sophistication, reaching their apogee in the 9th–10th centuries. At the same time, the office of vizier (&quot;wazīr&quot;) was also created to coordinate government. The administrative history of the Abbasid &quot;dīwāns&quot; is complex, since many were short-lived, temporary establishments for specific needs, while at times the sections of larger &quot;dīwān&quot; might also be termed &quot;dīwāns&quot;, and often a single individual was placed in charge of more than one department.

Caliph al-Saffah (r. 749–754) established a department for the confiscated properties of the Umayyads after his victory in the Abbasid Revolution. This was probably the antecedent of the later &quot;dīwān al-ḍiyāʿ&quot;, administering the caliph&#x27;s personal domains. Similarly, under al-Mansur (r. 754–775) there was a bureau of confiscations (&quot;dīwān al-muṣādara&quot;), as well as a &quot;dīwān al-aḥshām&quot;, probably in charge of palace service personnel, and a bureau of petitions to the Caliph (&quot;dīwān al-riḳāʿ&quot;). Caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775–785) created a parallel &quot;dīwān al-zimām&quot; (control bureau) for every one of the existing &quot;dīwāns&quot;, as well as a central control bureau (&quot;zimām al-azimma&quot;). These acted as comptrollers as well as coordinators between the various bureaus, or between individual &quot;dīwāns&quot; and the vizier. In addition, a &quot;dīwān al-maẓālim&quot; was created, staffed by judges, to hear complaints against government officials. The remit of the &quot;dīwān al-kharāj&quot; now included all land taxes (&quot;kharāj&quot;, &quot;zakāt&quot;, and &quot;jizya&quot;, both in money and in kind), while another department, the &quot;dīwān al-ṣadaqa&quot;, dealt with assessing the &quot;zakāt&quot; of cattle. The correspondence of the &quot;dīwān al-kharāj&quot; was checked by another department, the &quot;dīwān al-khātam&quot;. As in Umayyad times, miniature copies of the &quot;dīwān al-kharāj&quot;, the &quot;dīwān al-jund&quot; and the &quot;dīwān al-rasāʾil&quot; existed in every province, but by the mid-9th century each province also maintained a branch of its &quot;dīwān al-kharāj&quot; in the capital.

The treasury department (&quot;bayt al-māl&quot; or &quot;dīwān al-sāmī&quot;) kept the records of revenue and expenditure, both in money and in kind, with specialized &quot;dīwāns&quot; for each category of the latter (e.g. cereals, cloth, etc.). Its secretary had to mark all orders of payment to make them valid, and it drew up monthly and yearly balance sheets. The &quot;dīwān al-jahbad̲ha&quot;, responsible for the treasury&#x27;s balance sheets, was eventually branched off from it, while the treasury domains were placed under the &quot;dīwān al-ḍiyāʿ&quot;, of which there appear at times to have been several. In addition, a department of confiscated property (&quot;dīwān al-musādarīn&quot;) and confiscated estates (&quot;dīwān al-ḍiyāʿ al-maqbūḍa&quot;) existed.

Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid (r. 892–902) grouped the branches of the provincial &quot;dīwāns&quot; present in the capital into a new department, the &quot;dīwān al-dār&quot; (bureau of the palace) or &quot;dīwān al-dār al-kabīr&quot; (great bureau of the palace), where &quot;al-dār&quot; probably meant the vizier&#x27;s palace. At the same time, the various &quot;zimām&quot; bureaux were combined into a single &quot;dīwān al-zimām&quot; which re-checked all assessments, payments and receipts against its own records and, according to the 11th-century scholar al-Mawardi, was the &quot;guardian of the rights of &quot;bayt al-māl&quot; [the treasury] and the people&quot;. The &quot;dīwān al-nafaḳāt&quot; played a similar role with regards to expenses by the individual &quot;dīwāns&quot;, but by the end of the 9th century its role was mostly restricted to the finances of the caliphal palace. Under al-Muktafi (r. 902–908) the &quot;dīwān al-dār&quot; was broken up into three departments, the bureaux of the eastern provinces (&quot;dīwān al-mashriq&quot;), of the western provinces (&quot;dīwān al-maghrib&quot;), and of the Iraq (&quot;dīwān al-sawād&quot;), although under al-Muqtadir (r. 908–932) the &quot;dīwān al-dār&quot; still existed, with the three territorial departments considered sections of the latter. In 913/4, the vizier Ali ibn Isa established a new department for charitable endowments (&quot;dīwān al-birr&quot;), whose revenue went to the upkeep of holy places, the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and on volunteers fighting in the holy war against the Byzantine Empire.

Under Caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861), a bureau of servants and pages (&quot;dīwān al-mawālī wa ’l-ghilmān&quot;), possibly an evolution of the &quot;dīwān al-aḥshām&quot;, existed for the huge number of slaves and other attendants of the palace. In addition, the &quot;dīwān al-khātam&quot;, now also known as the &quot;dīwān al-sirr&quot; (bureau of confidential affairs) grew in importance. Miskawayh also mentions the existence of a &quot; dīwān al-ḥaram&quot;, which supervised the women&#x27;s quarters of the palace.

==Later Islamic dynasties==

As the Abbasid Caliphate began to fragment in the mid 9th century, its administrative machinery was copied by the emergent successor dynasties, with the already extant local &quot;dīwān&quot; branches likely providing the base on which the new administrations were formed.

===Saffarids, Ziyarid, Sajids, Buyids and Samanids===

The administrative machinery of the Tahirid governors of Khurasan is almost unknown, except that their treasury was located in their capital of Nishapur. Ya&#x27;qub al-Saffar (r. 867–879), the founder of the Saffarid dynasty who supplanted the Tahirids, is known to have had a bureau of the army (&quot;dīwān al-ʿarḍ&quot;) for keeping the lists and supervising the payment of the troops, at his capital Zarang. Under his successor Amr ibn al-Layth (r. 879–901) there were two further treasuries, the &quot;māl-e khāṣṣa&quot;, and an unnamed bureau under the chief secretary corresponding to a chancery (&quot;dīwān al-rasāʾil&quot; or &quot;dīwān al-inshāʾ&quot;).

The Buyids, who took over Baghdad and the remains of the Abbasid Caliphate in 946, drew partly on the established Abbasid practice, but was adapted to suit the nature of the rather decentralized Buyid &quot;confederation&quot; of autonomous emirates. The Buyid bureaucracy was headed by three great departments: the &quot;dīwān al-wazīr&quot;, charged with finances, the &quot;dīwān al-rasāʾil&quot; as the state chancery, and the &quot;dīwān al-jaysh&quot; for the army. The Buyid regime was a military regime, its ruling caste composed of Turkish and Daylamite troops. As a result, the army department was of particular importance, and its head, the &quot;ʿariḍ al-jaysh&quot;, is frequently mentioned in the sources of the period. Indeed, at the turn of the 11th century, there were two &quot;ʿariḍs&quot;, one for the Turks and one for the Daylamites, hence the department was often called &quot;department of the two armies&quot; (&quot;dīwān al-jayshayn&quot;). A number of junior departments, like the &quot;dīwān al-zimām&quot;, the &quot;dīwān al-ḍiyāʿ&quot;, or the &quot;dīwān al-barīd&quot; were directly inherited from the Abbasid government. Under Adud al-Dawla (r. 978–983), however, the &quot;dīwān al-sawād&quot;, which oversaw the rich lands of lower Iraq, was moved from Baghdad to Shiraz. In addition, a &quot;dīwān al-khilāfa&quot; was established to oversee the affairs of the Abbasid caliphs, who continued to reside in Baghdad as puppets of the Buyid emirs.

===Seljuks===

The Great Seljuks tended to cherish their nomadic origins, with their sultans leading a court to their various capitals. Coupled with their frequent absence on campaign, the vizier assumed an even greater prominence, concentrating the direction of civil, military and religious affairs in his own bureau, the &quot;supreme dīwān&quot; (&quot;dīwān al-aʿlā&quot;). The &quot;dīwān al-aʿlā&quot; was further subdivided into a chancery (&quot;dīwān al-inshāʾ wa’l-ṭughrā&quot;, also called &quot;dīwān al-rasāʾil&quot;) under the &quot;ṭughrāʾī&quot; or &quot;munshī al-mamālik&quot;, an accounting department (&quot;dīwān al-zimām wa’l-istīfāʾ&quot;) under the &quot;mustawfī al-mamālik&quot;, a fiscal oversight office (&quot;dīwān al-ishrāf&quot; or &quot;dīwān al-muʿāmalāt&quot;) under the &quot;mushrif al-mamālik&quot;, and the army department (&quot;dīwān al-ʿarḍ&quot; or &quot;dīwān al-jaysh&quot;) under the &quot;ʿariḍ&quot; (further divided into the recruitment and supply bureau, &quot;dīwān al-rawātib&quot;, and the salary and land grants bureau, &quot;dīwān al-iqṭāʾ&quot;). A number of lesser departments is also attested, although they may not have existed at the same time: the office charged with the redress of grievances (&quot;dīwān al-maẓālim&quot;), the state treasury (&quot;bayt al-māl&quot;) and the sultan&#x27;s private treasury (&quot;bayt al-māl al-khaṣṣ&quot;), confiscations (&quot;dīwān al-muṣādara&quot;), the land tax office (&quot;dīwān al-kharāj&quot;) and the department of religious endowments or &quot;waqfs&quot; (&quot;dīwān al-awqāf&quot;). A postal department (&quot;dīwān al-barīd&quot;) also existed but fell into disuse. The system was apparently partly copied in provincial centres as well.

===Ottoman Tripolitania===

Following the Ottoman conquest of North Africa, the Maghreb was divided into three provinces, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. After 1565, administrative authority in Tripoli was vested in a Pasha directly appointed by the Sultan in Constantinople. The sultan provided the pasha with a corps of Janissaries, which was in turn divided into a number of companies under the command of a junior officer or &quot;Bey&quot;. The Janissaries quickly became the dominant force in Ottoman Libya. As a self-governing military guild answerable only to their own laws and protected by a &quot;Divan&quot; (in this context, a council of senior officers who advised the Pasha), the Janissaries soon reduced the Pasha to a largely ceremonial role.

==Government councils==
The &quot;Divan-ı Hümayun&quot; or Sublime Porte was for many years the council of ministers of the Ottoman Empire. It consisted of the Grand Vizier, who presided, and the other viziers, the &quot;kadi&#x27;askers&quot;, the &quot;nisanci&quot;, and the &quot;defterdars&quot;.

The Assemblies of the Danubian Principalities under Ottoman rule were also called &quot;divan&quot; (&quot;Divanuri&quot; in Romanian) (see Akkerman Convention, ad hoc Divan).

In Javanese and related languages, the cognate Dewan is the standard word for chamber, as in the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat or Chamber of People&#x27;s Representatives.

==Ministerial departments==

<text>Philippe Marie Jean Joseph Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon, known as Philippe de Villiers (; born 25 March 1949), is a French entrepreneur, politician and novelist. He is the founder of the Puy du Fou theme park in Vendée, which is centred around the history of France. Appointed Secretary of State for Culture in 1986 by President François Mitterrand, de Villiers entered the National Assembly the following year and the European Parliament in 1994.

After leaving the Republican Party (PR) to found the Movement for France (MPF), he was its nominee in the 1995 and 2007 presidential elections. He received 4.74% of the vote the first time, placing seventh; he won 2.23% of the vote twelve years later, putting him in sixth place. De Villiers has been internationally notable for his criticism of mass immigration and Islam in France, as well as his ardent support of the French way of life. His brother, General Pierre de Villiers, served as Chief of the Defence Staff from 2014 to 2017.

==Personal life==

De Villiers was born in Boulogne in the department of Vendée, Western France, the second of five children and eldest son of Jacques Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon (born in Nancy, 14 November 1913) and his wife Edwige d&#x27;Arexy (born in Nantes, 1 July 1925). His paternal grandfather, Louis Le Jolis de Villiers, born at Brucheville on 17 October 1874, was killed in action in World War I at Saint-Paul-en-Forêt on 10 September 1914. On 24 October 1904, he had married Jeanne de Saintignon (27 July 1880 – 25 August 1959), by whom he had five children, the youngest of whom was Philippe&#x27;s father, Jacques.

De Villiers received a master&#x27;s degree in Law in 1971, graduated from the Paris Institute of Political Studies in 1973 and from the École nationale d&#x27;administration in 1978. After his studies, De Villiers became a successful entrepreneur. He created the Puy du Fou, one of the most visited theme parks in France, as a living showcase for its history. The theme park includes a replica medieval city with the &#x27;Gallo-Roman Stadium&#x27;, a colosseum designed by De Villiers to stoke patriotic feeling by recreating Gallic rebellions against Imperial Rome. The Puy du Fou park received awards from the Themed Entertainment Association in 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2019.

He is a French aristocrat and a descendant of diplomat and historian Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur and Minister and Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. As of 2007 he is a Member of the European Parliament (Independence/Democracy Group). He is 1.85 meters tall.

He is married to Dominique du Buor de Villeneuve, born in Valenciennes on 4 October 1950 and has seven children: Caroline (born in Montaigu, 12 August 1976), Guillaume (born in La Roche-sur-Yon, 14 December 1977), Nicolas (born in La Roche-sur-Yon, 10 September 1979), Marie (born in Nantes, 5 October 1981), Laurent (born in La Roche-sur-Yon, 8 April 1984), Bérengère (born in La Roche-sur-Yon, 1 October 1988) and Blanche (born in Cholet, 21 June 1993).

==Career==
===1995 presidential bid===

From 1976 to 1978, De Villiers served as a senior civil servant in the Chirac administration. In 1981, he resigned his post as subprefect because he did not want to serve the government of the Socialist President François Mitterrand. In 1986 and 1987, he briefly served as Secretary of State for Culture () in the second government of Jacques Chirac, under Minister François Léotard. His appointment was initially viewed badly by &quot;Libération&quot; and several other press agencies, which referred to his &quot;ambiguous personality&quot;. However, Villiers supported Leotard&#x27;s mixed, non-ideological policy towards French culture.

In 1987, he was elected into local office as a member in Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s Republican Party. He became a rising star within the Union for French Democracy. During the public debate over the Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union, in 1992, he achieved lasting prominence in the media as an anti-Treaty activist. This set him apart from most prominent members of the mainstream political right. The French people narrowly ratified the Treaty in September 1992.

De Villiers led an anti-European integration list in 1994 receiving about 12 percent of the votes, placing it in third place behind the Gaullists and the Socialists. Villiers centered the campaign on opposition to the European Union along with a call to eliminate corruption in government. In November 1994, Villers left the Republican Party to form Movement for France. He ran for President of France in 1995 and received about 5 percent of the vote.

===2007 presidential bid===
Once a member of the Union for French Democracy, he then led the Movement for France, which enjoyed some success in elections for the European Parliament. The party&#x27;s share of the vote declined in the 2004 European Parliament election. Nevertheless, Villiers and two other members of his party were elected.

De Villiers ran for the French presidency in 2007, and based his campaign on his opposition to what he sees as the rampant Islamisation of France. In May 2006, polls showed that he had garnered the support of about 4% of the electorate, almost twice as high as he actually polled in the first round of the presidential election. An &quot;Ifop-Paris-Match&quot; poll conducted on 12 October 2006 gave him his highest ever popularity rating, with 37% saying they &quot;have an excellent or good opinion&quot; of Villiers, and 28% saying they could vote for him in 2007. This was not borne out in the results of the first round of voting, with him receiving less than 3% of the popular vote.

Following the first round of the 2007 presidential election, he called on voters to vote for Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) candidate Nicolas Sarkozy to counter the Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate Ségolène Royal and the left.

Villiers and Konstantin Malofeev are planning to build two Russian history related theme parks: one in Moscow and one in Yalta (Crimea); this is in spite of Malofeev being added to the European Union list of people and organizations sanctioned during the Russo-Ukrainian War (Malofeev is suspected of funding the pro-Russian rebels in Donbas during the Russo-Ukrainian War). In August 2014 Villiers travelled to Crimea to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin; while there, he defended the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea by saying the Crimean park will &quot;promote the history of Crimea as part of the long history of Russia&quot;. He also stated there &quot;I would gladly swap Hollande and Sarkozy for Putin&quot;.

== Political positions==

=== Criticism of Islam ===
De Villiers is known for his criticism of Islam in France. He has stated, &quot;I am the only politician who tells the French the truth about the Islamisation of France&quot; and, &quot;I do not think Islam is compatible with the French Republic&quot;. He advocates ending all construction of mosques, banning all Islamist organisations suspected of links to terrorism, and expelling extremist individuals from France.

De Villiers published &quot;Les mosquées de Roissy: nouvelles révélations sur l&#x27;islamisation en France&quot; (&quot;The Mosques of Roissy: New Revelations about Islamization in France&quot;) in 2006. In it he alleged, using internal documents from whistleblowers, that the Muslim Brotherhood had infiltrated security personnel at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris. The book led to revocation of seventy-two employees&#x27; security clearances and closure of six makeshift Muslim prayer rooms.

&quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; have labelled De Villiers as &quot;far right&quot; because of his views of Islam and of Muslim immigrants.

=== Political philosophy ===
Villiers is a nationalist, a traditionalist, and a leading eurosceptic. He has self-described as a &quot;rooted conservative&quot;. During his tenure under François Léotard, he said that he shared Léotard&#x27;s American-based &quot;libertarian liberalism&quot;. In 1995, &quot;The Economist&quot; referred to him as &quot;an ephemeral Catholic monarchist&quot;.

He advocates cutting taxes, expelling all illegal immigrants, and preventing Turkey from joining the EU. He is a vocal critic of the European Union&#x27;s relationship with France, accusing it of &quot;destroying their jobs, their security and their identity&quot; and saying that &quot;the Europe of Brussels is an anti-democratic dictatorship&quot;. He was a leader of the side advocating a &#x27;No&#x27; vote in the 2005 French referendum of the European Constitution. The &#x27;No&#x27; side won the vote, which the activists believed constituted a major victory for Euroscepticism in France. Villiers then launched a campaign to restore the franc, remarking that &quot;Everybody notes today that the adoption of the euro was a technical success but its economic, political and human toll is incontestable.&quot;

Villiers opposes immigration into France in general, but he has advocated that &quot;individual cases be treated with the greatest humanity.&quot; He also opposes expelling current immigrants residing in France or subjecting them to discrimination in housing, employment, or other spheres. Despite their differences on these and other issues, the National Front&#x27;s Jean Marie Le Pen has remarked that Villiers&#x27; ideas were &quot;lifted&quot; from him and that their &quot;votes should be added together&quot;.

Villiers coined the phrase &quot;Polish Plumber&quot; in a June 2005 political speech about the Bolkestein directive, referring to the perceived threat of cheap East European labour to French wages. The mythical figure became a central point of debate in France, and it later prompted an international controversy. He has also referred to the &quot;Latvian mason&quot; and the &quot;Estonian gardener.&quot;

American author Harvey Gerald Simmons has compared the &quot;Villiers phenomenon&quot; to Ross Perot&#x27;s support in the 1992 American Presidential election. He stated that De Villiers has a populist, anti-establishment image that puts him on the edges of the mainstream political right of France rather than in the far right.

<text>The Burden Iron Works was an iron works and industrial complex on the Hudson River and Wynantskill Creek in Troy, New York. It once housed the Burden Water Wheel, the most powerful vertical water wheel in history. It is widely believed that George Washington Gale Ferris Jr., inventor of the Ferris wheel, had occasion to observe the wheel while a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The iron works site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an archaeological site in 1977. The Burden Ironworks Office Building was previously listed in 1972.

==Henry Burden==
Henry Burden was born in Dunblane, Perthshire, Scotland, April 22, 1791, the son of a farmer. He studied engineering at the University of Edinburgh, and emigrated to America in 1819.

Burden started at the Townsend &amp; Corning Foundry, manufacturers of cast iron plows and other agricultural implements, located in Albany. The next year, he invented an improved plow, and a cultivator, which was said to have been the first to be put into practical operation in this country. He also made mechanical improvements on threshing machines and grist mills.

He moved to Troy in 1822, and worked as superintendent of the Troy Iron and Nail Factory. The factory was located on north side of the Wynantskill Creek in South Troy, about a half-mile northeast of today&#x27;s Troy–Menands Bridge. Burden&#x27;s inventions, which automated work that was previously done by hand, made the factory extremely profitable. Burden soon became the sole owner of the factory and renamed it H. Burden and Sons. The Burden Iron Works, as it came to be known, produced a variety of iron-based products.

==Iron Works== 

Henry Burden realized that Troy&#x27;s strategic location as a hub of rail and water transportation networks made it possible to produce and ship an enormous quantity of finished goods. Burden replaced the small wooden mill with a large millworks. The river adjacent to the works was shallow and full of bars, and the land along the river was low and frequently flooded. At great expense, Burden had the grounds filled in, and the river dredged, so that the company&#x27;s docks were accessible to large vessels. The property had nearly a mile of river frontage. The Hudson River Railroad ran east of it.

In order to find the necessary power to run his foundry, in 1851 Burden designed and constructed a 60-foot wheel. This was not the largest water wheel of its type, but likely the most powerful. A larger water wheel is at Laxey on the Isle of Man and at Greenock, Scotland, the latter supplied by Shaw&#x27;s Waterworks with water from an elevated reservoir. The Burden Wheel appears to have had more buckets. The Burden Water Wheel was sixty-two feet in diameter and twenty-two feet in breadth, was supplied by a small stream, the Wynantskill Creek. Burden originated a system of reservoirs along the Wynantskill Creek to hold the water in reserve and increase the water-supply to power the mills. Burden&#x27;s wheel weighed 250 tons and could produce 500 horsepower when spinning 2.5 times a minute. The water wheel itself was of what came to be termed the &quot;suspension&quot; type, with iron rods in tension replacing the usual arms. It was made almost entirely of iron, save for the drum or soling of the wheel and its buckets. This great wheel was continuously in service night and day for nearly one half of a century. Following its abandonment in the 1890s, it lay idle for another twenty years before its final collapse. A local poet had called it &#x27;the Niagara of Water-wheels&#x27; The American muralist Arthur Covey produced an etching of this water wheel titled &quot;The Great Wheel, South Troy&quot;.

The immense establishment comprised two works - the &#x27;upper works,&#x27; or water mills, on the Wynantskill, a short distance east of the Hudson River, and the new works, called the &#x27;lower works,&#x27; or steam mills, located on the &#x27;farm company&#x27; property and the Hoyle farm. The Upper Works contained a rolling mill and puddling forge, a horseshoe factory, a warehouse which could store 7,000 tons of horseshoes, a rivet factory, a rivet warehouse, the stables, a supply store, and the general business office. The Lower Works contained two massive blast furnaces of brick and stone, each sixty-five feet high; two casting houses, two stock houses, an engine room, a puddling forge, a rolling mill, a swaging shop, a punching shop, a horseshoe warehouse, more offices, a machine shop, a blacksmith shop, a foundry, a pattern shop, a tin and plumbing shop, an iron warehouse, and a supply store with a draughting room and laboratory. Coal dust and smoke from the furnaces spread over the Iron Works district of Troy.

Together the two sites contained sixty puddling furnaces, twenty heating furnaces, fourteen trains of rolls, three rotary squeezers, nine horseshoe machines, twelve rivet machines which each produced eighty rivets a minute, ten large and fifteen small steam engines, seventy boilers, and the great water-wheel. The puddling furnaces employed hundreds of men, stripped to the waist, wearing hob-nailed shoes, and covered in coal dust. Boys worked at the swaging furnaces, removing the heated horseshoes with tongs and placing them on the revolving dies of the swaging machine. Burden&#x27;s works manufactured horseshoes in a variety of patterns and sizes. They were packed for shipping 100 lbs. to a keg. A network of railroad tracks moved trainloads of iron ore, and sand among the blast furnaces and steam mills. The company owned its own locomotive.

The steam derricks, used for unloading coal, were designed by Burden&#x27;s son William. A wire cable stretched between, on which an iron carriage traveled three hundred feet from the dock to the coal heap, carrying a self-dumping bucket with the capacity to hold a ton of coal. A steam engine hoisted the filled bucket to the cable, along which it traveled to the point where the tilting apparatus overturned its contents upon the pile. Alongside the coal heaps were vast deposits of iron ore, mostly from the area of Lake Champlain. There were also piles of limestone, from the downstream city of Hudson, used as flux to help in the fusion of the ores.

The firm owned 50 horses and a number of wagons to move the ore, coal, sand, clay, and manufactured goods from the different mills. It also owned extensive iron mines with superior quality ore, and a number of limestone quarries to serve the furnaces.
==Today==

An exhibit on Greater Troy&#x27;s industrial history is housed in the former office of the Burden Iron Works. Constructed 1881-2, the distinguished brick Romanesque Revival building contains examples of objects manufactured in the city throughout the 19th century. The museum is operated by the Hudson Mohawk Industrial Gateway. The museum is open by appointment only.

<text>Benjamin Hornigold (c. 1680–1719) was an English pirate towards the end of the Golden Age of Piracy.

Born in England in the late 17th century, Hornigold began his pirate career in 1713, attacking merchant ships in the Bahamas. He helped to establish the &quot;Republic of Pirates&quot; in Nassau and by 1717 was the captain of one of the most heavily armed ships in the region, called the &quot;Ranger&quot;. It was at this time he appointed Edward Teach, best known in history books as &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, as his second-in-command. Mindful not to attack British-led ships during his career, his crew eventually grew tired of the tactic and Hornigold was voted out as captain. In December 1718, Hornigold accepted a King&#x27;s Pardon for his crimes and became a pirate hunter, pursuing his former allies on behalf of the Governor of the Bahamas, Woodes Rogers. He was killed when his ship was wrecked on a reef near New Spain during the hurricane season of 1719.

== Early career ==
Hornigold&#x27;s early life is unrecorded, although sometimes people claim he was born in the English county of Norfolk, where the surname Hornigold or Hornagold appears. If so, he might have first served at sea aboard ships whose home port was either King&#x27;s Lynn or Great Yarmouth. His first documented acts of piracy took place in the winter of 1713–1714, when he employed periaguas (sailing canoes) and the sloop &quot;Happy Return&quot;, alongside Daniel Stillwell, John Cockram, and John West to menace merchant vessels off the coast of New Providence and its capital Nassau, where he had established a &#x27;Privateers&#x27; or &#x27;Pirates&#x27; republic. Hornigold himself sailed a ship named the &quot;Marianne&quot;. After a mutiny in the summer of 1716, he and his supporters were left with a captured sloop. By 1717, Hornigold had at his command a thirty-gun sloop he named the &quot;Ranger&quot;, which was probably the most heavily armed ship in the region, and this allowed him to seize other vessels with impunity.

Hornigold&#x27;s second-in-command during this period was Edward Teach, who would later be better known as the pirate Blackbeard. When Hornigold took command of the &quot;Ranger&quot;, he delegated the captaincy of his earlier sloop to Teach. In the spring of 1717 the two pirate captains seized three merchant ships in quick succession, a Spanish one carrying 120 barrels of flour bound for Havana, another a Bermudian sloop with a cargo of spirits and the third a Portuguese ship travelling from Madeira with a cargo of white wine.

In March 1717, Hornigold attacked an armed merchant vessel sent to the Bahamas by the Governor of South Carolina to hunt for pirates. The merchantman escaped by running itself aground on Cat Cay, and its captain later reported that Hornigold&#x27;s fleet had increased to five vessels, with a combined crew of around 350 pirates. In April 1717 Hornigold is recorded as operating alongside Captain Napin (or Napping), looting several ships off Jamaica, Puerto Bello, and Cuba before being chased away by the warship &quot;HMS Winchelsea&quot;. Hornigold had earlier forced aboard a surgeon named John Howell but released him on Nassau; when French pirate Jean Bonadvis tried to force Howell aboard his ship later in April 1717, Hornigold accepted Howell back aboard to protect him. After parting ways with Napin in June or July they sailed together sporadically until October 1717.

Hornigold is recorded as having attacked a sloop off the coast of Honduras; one of the passengers of the captured vessel recounted, &quot;they did us no further injury than the taking most of our hats from us, having got drunk the night before, as they told us, and toss&#x27;d theirs overboard&quot;. In September 1717, Hornigold and Teach met Major Stede Bonnet and his ship &quot;Revenge&quot;. Bonnet, having been wounded in battle, ceded his command to Teach. In October, another sloop was added to the fleet.

==Overthrow and pardon==
Despite his apparent maritime supremacy, Hornigold remained careful not to attack British-flagged ships, apparently to maintain the legal defence that he was a privateer operating against England&#x27;s enemies in the War of the Spanish Succession. This scrupulous approach was not to the liking of his lieutenants, and in the summer of 1716 a vote was taken among the combined crews to attack any vessel they chose. Hornigold opposed the decision and was replaced as captain of &quot;Marianne&quot; by Samuel Bellamy, whose friend Paulsgrave Williams was elected quartermaster. Hornigold and his supporters were left with a captured sloop which was commanded by Teach after Hornigold acquired the &quot;Ranger&quot;. He continued piracy operations from Nassau until December 1717, when word arrived of a general pardon for pirates offered by the King. Hornigold sailed to Jamaica with the &quot;Ranger&quot; and one of the other sloops in January 1718 and received a pardon from the governor there. He later became a pirate hunter for the new governor of the Bahamas, Woodes Rogers.

===The King&#x27;s Pardon of 1717 and 1718===
On 5 September 1717, King George I Issued the Proclamation of 1717 &quot;For Suppressing Pirates in the West Indies&quot;. This document granted a pardon to all pirates who surrendered themselves to any colonial governor or governor under the domain of the British Empire safe passage and were guaranteed a &quot;clean slate&quot; of their record. However, word of this did not get out to the West Indies and so in December 1718 another proclamation, or more famously known as the King&#x27;s Pardon of 1718, was issued for the same purpose. In both of these documents, not only were pirates granted a clean slate on their record, but they were also offered a large sum of money for the capturing of other pirates who were guilty of piracy, murder, and treason against His Majesty. More specifically, for every captain who was captured, the person responsible would receive £100, , and for every lieutenant and boatswain a reward of £40 (£) was offered. Each level of member on a pirate ship had a reward placed on their heads from this point on.

==Pirate hunter and death==
Rogers commissioned Hornigold to hunt down any and all recusant pirates, including some ex-comrades such as his former lieutenant, Teach (Blackbeard). He stalked but could not apprehend Charles Vane, capturing Vane&#x27;s associate Nicholas Woodall instead, followed by John Auger, both of whom had accepted the same pardon as Hornigold, but later slid back into piracy. In December 1718 Governor Rogers wrote to the Board of Trade in London commending Hornigold&#x27;s efforts to remedy his reputation as a pirate by hunting his former allies.

At some point late 1719, Governor Rogers commissioned Captain Hornigold and a few other of Rogers&#x27; most trusted captains to help safeguard and facilitate the trade of valuable wares with the Spanish. During the voyage, Hornigold&#x27;s ship was caught in a hurricane somewhere between New Providence and New Spain, and was wrecked on an uncharted reef. The incident is referred to in the contemporary account &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot; by Captain Charles Johnson, which states, &quot;in one of which voyages ... Captain Hornigold, another of the famous pirates, was cast away upon rocks, a great way from land, and perished, but five of his men got into a canoe and were saved.&quot; The specific location of the reef remains unknown.

<text>The Harderbahn (HB) is one of two funiculars that operate from the town of Interlaken. The Harderbahn leads to the western end of the Harder in the north of Interlaken across the river Aare, in Switzerland.

This funicular, the longer of the two, runs in 10 minutes from the base station &quot;Interlaken Harderbahn&quot; ( above sea level) to a station near the viewpoint Harderkulm (). From the &quot;Harder Kulm&quot; top station (), a five-minute walk leads to the Harderkulm viewpoint and the Restaurant &quot;Harder Kulm&quot;, a distinctive pagoda structure with views from its terrace, over the towns of Interlaken and Unterseen, the Lakes of Thun and Brienz, the valley of the Lütschine and the summits of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau.

The line is owned by the &quot;Harderbahn AG&quot;, a subsidiary of the &quot;Jungfraubahn Holding AG&quot;, a holding company that also owns the Wengernalpbahn, Jungfraubahn, Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen–Mürren, and Firstbahn. Through that holding company it is part of the &quot;Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe&quot; marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Berner Oberland-Bahn and Schynige Platte-Bahn.

==History==

In 1890 Dr. Fritz Michel gained a concession to build an &quot;electrical cable railway&quot; on the Harder, to the north of the city of Interlaken, however financial backing for such a project was difficult to obtain and it was not until November 1905 that construction started and was to last for three years. In order not to disfigure the landscape the track was laid in a quadrant rather than a straight line, the usual format for such railways.

With the aid of Lausanne banker Ernest Chavannes and engineers Gaston Boiceau and Henri Muret the funicular opened on 15 May 1908. It has a length of and climbs from the lower station (&quot;Interlaken Harderbahn&quot;), situated near to Interlaken Ost train station (a five-minute walk), to the upper station (&quot;Harder Kulm&quot;) near the viewpoint. The journey takes ten minutes. A tourist attraction, an alpine wildlife park was opened in 1913 above the base station.

Modernisation of the funicular took place during the 1960s with a new engine and cable being installed in 1961, and new carriages coming to the line to commence operation on 14 May 1966. Until 1990 this had always been a summer only operation, but instead of closing at the end of September, the funicular continued through the winter. The funicular operates only a summer timetable, usually from mid-April to late October.

In 1997 the wire rope was replaced.

In 2008 the two passenger carriages were replaced.

==Operations==
The line, with a gauge of , is single track with a single passing point and is operated by two coaches. Power supply is by a 400 V three-phase system and the line uses the Stromsystem Drehstrom which controls the passing of the cars safely.

== Passenger Vehicles ==

Two new passenger cars, numbered 1 and 2, were delivered in 1966. these were constructed by specialist builders Carrossiere Gangloff AG of Bern with under frames, brakes etc., by the von Roll company. Each carry 62 passengers in four compartments. After over 40 years service it was decided that these would be in need of replacement prior to the centenary of the railway in 2008 and the order was placed. The need became essential following the damage to one of the cars from a mudslide caused by extreme weather on the night of 8-9 August 2007.

The new &quot;centenery&quot; coaches, in the line&#x27;s usual red livery, were delivered on 13 March 2008. These were lifted onto the line from the alpine wildlife park in readiness for the commencement of the season. The new coaches were built by Gongloff Cabins AG of Bern and hold 65 persons in three sections. The doors are power operated and the downhill-facing section has an area of staged seating which is accessed through the compartment above, where the driver controls are located. The vehicles, numbered as with the previous set, now also carry names and crests; No.1 is named &quot;Interlaken&quot;, No.2 &quot;Unterseen&quot;. They have glass roof panels which allow uninterrupted views of the mountains and the valley below.

<doc id="576033" wikidata="Q202622" url="?curid=576033" title="G-14">
<text>The G-14 was an organisation of European football clubs that existed between 1998 and 2008. It consisted of 14 European top class teams initially, later expanded to 18. It was disbanded in 2008 and was replaced by the European Club Association representing over 100 clubs, in a deal reached with UEFA and FIFA.

==Composition==
The G-14 clubs were spread across seven countries, and had won around 250 national league titles (although some of the member teams, Bayer Leverkusen for example, had actually never won top league title throughout their history). Three came from the top division of Italy; two from each of Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and England; and one came from Portugal. G-14 members had won the European Cup/Champions League 41 times out of 51 seasons.

The 2004 Champions League final was the first in that competition since 1992 in which one of the finalists was not a G-14 member; the 2004 final featured member FC Porto and non-member AS Monaco, with Porto winning the final. There have been only four Champions League or European Cup finals where both teams were non-members of G-14 (1970, 1979, 1980, 2021).

==History==
The G-14 was founded on 14 October in 1998 by 14 leading clubs to provide a unified voice in negotiations with UEFA and FIFA. New members could join by invitation only. 

Italian company Media Partners had planned a European breakaway league for the G-14 teams, forcing UEFA to expand the Champions League from 16 to 32 clubs for the 1999–2000 season.

In August 2002, four more clubs joined, taking the membership to 18, although the organisation retained its original name.

The idea of a breakaway league similar to the basketball ULEB Euroleague re-emerged in December 2003 when a group of Spanish businessmen, headed by entrepreneur Carlos Garcia Pardo, said that they are aiming to establish a 16-team competition called the &quot;European Golden Cup&quot; as a rival to UEFA Champions League.

During that time the G-14 group were reportedly unhappy that UEFA has opted to cut the second phase of the Champions League from the 2003–04 season: a move that reduced each club&#x27;s number of potential European matches by four. As a result, G-14 were reported to be considering for a European superleague to begin in the season 2006–07, when the latest television deal for the Champions League would end. 

As the leading clubs in European Football, their power on the world stage was best demonstrated during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where they provided 22% of participating players. This supported their assertion that national associations should pay players&#x27; wages whilst on international duty and provide compensation in the case of injuries. In April 2004, G-14 initiated a preliminary investigation into FIFA by the Swiss Competition Commission, when they complained of FIFA&#x27;s requiring their players to be available for FIFA international competitions without compensating the clubs. FIFA president Sepp Blatter refused to negotiate with the G-14 on the matter.

On 5 September 2005, the G-14 clubs decided to take FIFA to court over paying players for internationals after the Belgian club Charleroi lost Abdelmajid Oulmers in November for eight months when he was injured playing for Morocco.

Prior to the 2006 World Cup, the G-14 members demanded a &quot;fair percentage&quot; of receipts from tournaments, such as the World Cup, to compensate for the clubs releasing players to compete in these tournaments.

The last president of the group was Olympique Lyonnais chairman Jean-Michel Aulas, who replaced David Dein, who stepped down after six months of a two-year presidency after leaving Arsenal. Aulas was elected president on 16 May 2007, after securing unanimous agreement from member clubs to the principle of expanding the G-14&#x27;s membership. Aulas announced his intention to consider inviting a further 16 teams to join, stating that he wanted the G14 &quot;to expand geographically and be strengthened by other clubs&quot;. In October 2007, 22 additional European clubs were invited to participate in talks towards expansion.

On 28 May 2007, at an extraordinary meeting of the UEFA Congress in Zürich, UEFA President Michel Platini called upon G-14 to disband, declaring that they were &quot;elitist&quot; and that club grievances could be aired through a new UEFA body, the Professional Football Strategy Council.

On 15 January 2008, the G-14 and UEFA came to an agreement. FIFA and UEFA would pay compensation for international injuries and selection after a World Cup or European Championship and, in return, the G-14 agreed to disband on 15 February 2008. However a new European Club Association, created in that year by a merge between the G-14 and the European Club Forum, a task force created by the confederation in 2002 and composed by 103 clubs from then 53 nations affiliated to UEFA (at least one team from each country), including all G-14 clubs, was set up in its place.

<text>Roger Christie (born June 15, 1949) is an American ordained minister in the Religion of Jesus Church, which regards marijuana as a &quot;sacramental herb.&quot; In 2000, he founded the THC Ministry, which offered cannabis as a part of its services. On July 8, 2010, Christie and 13 other individuals associated with the THC Ministry were indicted by a Federal grand jury in Honolulu on marijuana possession and trafficking charges. On Sept. 27, 2013, Christie pleaded guilty to marijuana trafficking and two counts of failing to file income tax returns. On April 28, 2014, Christie was sentenced to a term of five years in federal prison, with credit for time already served at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center.

==Biography==
Roger Christie was born on June 15, 1949, in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Raised and schooled in the New Jersey countryside in the 1950s and 1960s, he graduated from high school in 1967.

After two years of college studies and flight training school in Miami, Florida he received an associate&#x27;s degree in Science and a Commercial Pilot certificate.

In 1970 he enlisted in the US Army and was trained as a G2 Intelligence Analyst at Fort Holabird, Maryland, a US Army &quot;spy school&quot;, but became disenchanted by the military and political missions in Vietnam and elsewhere. Christie refused his orders to serve in the Vietnam War and received an honorable discharge as a conscientious objector. His success in this process inspired him to pursue legal options to overturn United States drug policy, a fight which has led him to numerous court battles and arrests.

In 1986, he became a resident of Big Island, Hawaii. He was a co-founder of the Hawai&#x27;i Hemp Council in 1990 and, with Aaron Anderson (Ernest Allan Anderson), and Dwight Kondo, founded the Hawaiian Hemp Company. By 1991, he had one of the first retail hemp stores in the world. In 1996, Christie ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Hawaii County Council. In June, 2000, he was ordained as a minister by the Religion of Jesus Church through the Universal Life Church. He received his license to perform marriages in the State of Hawaii as a &quot;Cannabis Sacrament&quot; Minister and founded the THC Ministry. In 2004 he failed in an election bid for Mayor of Hawaii County.

===THC Ministry===

Roger Christie ran the THC Ministry (aka Hawaii Cannabis Ministry) in Hilo, Hawai&#x27;i for ten years. According to the Ministry&#x27;s website, &quot;We use Cannabis religiously and you can, too.&quot; Roger believes that spiritual and/or religious use of Cannabis hemp is worthy of First Amendment recognition and protections. He is on a life mission to achieve the goal of Equal Justice Under Law for Cannabis sacrament for the THC Ministry and for We the people. Home brewing of beer and wine with no limit on alcohol content is legal for every household in all 50 states. Roger&#x27;s goal includes the acceptance of home growing of safe and natural Cannabis in a similar way, using the concepts of Equal Justice Under Law, the First Amendment for religious freedom and the separation of church and state.

The THC Ministry blessing is: &quot;God, that&#x27;s great! Please show me the blessings in this situation ... and hurry! I am safe, I am loved and all is well.&quot;

The THC Ministry spiritual practices include: confession, forgiveness, gratitude and love. Example: &quot;I apologize for my part in _________ . Please forgive me. Thank you. I love you.&quot; It&#x27;s a karma cleaning technique to redeem oneself and to be able to move forward in greater integrity.

For a suggested donation, a person can become a &quot;Practitioner&quot; and receive a plaque designating their home and garden as a Sanctuary, a place of refuge for cultivating and using Cannabis in private as a sincere practice. The Sanctuary Kit for Practitioners also contains an &quot;affidavit of religious use&quot;, two self-laminating ID cards, and seven &quot;Sacramental Plant Tags&quot;. For $250, the donor would get a &quot;Cannabis Sanctuary Kit&quot; which also included the &quot;THC Ministry Cannabis Religion Guide&quot;. According to Christie, in the past &quot;We had Cannabis that people could donate for if they are &#x27;blue card&#x27; (medical marijuana permit) holders or sincere members of the ministry.&quot;

According to the FBI, an estimated 90% of the customers were Ministry members, while the remaining 10% had state medical marijuana cards.

In order to join the Ministry, prospective members in Hilo were asked to sit through a one-hour orientation session with Roger Christie. Roger Christie said he also scheduled membership sessions with passengers on visiting cruise ships who were in Hilo for one day, and one could also join by ordering a Ministry &quot;sanctuary kit&quot; by mail for a $250 &quot;donation.&quot; The kit includes a Letter of Good Standing which can be used by Ministers in many states to get a license to marry people from their state government specifically as a &quot;Cannabis sacrament&quot; Minister, legal precedents, Roger&#x27;s considerable activist history and track record of accomplishment in helping to end the war on marijuana and to repeal prohibition. Roger is the first person known in U.S. history to have been ordained, and then licensed by a state government as a Cannabis sacrament Minister. New members have to sign an affidavit stating that their use of Cannabis is for personal, private Sacramental use only. Once oriented and welcomed into the THC Ministry a new member has a built-in religious defense to arrest and prosecution for sincere, private, non-commercial use of Cannabis hemp for life. The goal is to have a stronger &quot;affirmative defense&quot; for all sincere members. &quot;Reasonable doubt&quot; is, in theory, all that&#x27;s needed to succeed in a jury trial. Good manners, respect, sincerity and the legitimacy of membership in the THC Ministry provides that reasonable doubt.

The discovery of Cannabis hemp being the &#x27;fragrant cane&#x27;, Kaneh Bosom in Hebrew, in the Bible recipe of Exodus 30:23 for holy anointing oil was made by researcher and author Chris Bennett. Roger is credited with making and returning the holy anointing oil of Moses and the christening oil of Jesus to use in the THC Ministry. The words Messiah, Christ and Mahdi all translate to &quot;anointed&quot;. Christian is &quot;an anointed one&quot;. Jesus Christ translates to &quot;I am anointed.&quot; Anti-Christ translates to &quot;against anointing&quot;. Roger likes to say, &quot;We believe anointing is a literal thing. Anoint your crown with holy oil and hear the angels sing!&quot;

In 2009, the ministry was open three days a week from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. During this three-hour period, there were up to 70 members served. The Christies and their staff welcomed people from all walks of life. Each member, patient or visitor was required to wash their hands with hemp soap upon entering and to have good manners and respect while visiting the offices in the Moses Building in Hilo.

Roger Christie provided ministry services and Cannabis sacraments to members and medical patients, alike. Services included counseling, fellowship, weddings, funerals and more. Cannabis sacraments included holy anointing oil (See Exodus 30:23, and Mark 6:13), Cannabis tinctures made with French cognacs, and a non-alcoholic tincture made with vegetable glycerine and Cannabis flowers. &quot;There&#x27;s a Bud in Every Bottle&quot; is the motto. There were often &quot;Aloha bags&quot; of Cannabis trimmings given for free to those in need. &quot;We liked to say &quot;yes&quot; to Cannabis culture people who were used to hearing &quot;no&quot; too often in life. &quot;Our goal every day was to see everyone leave the ministry with a smile.&quot;

Rev. Roger Christie and the THC Ministry sued the U.S. government for declaratory relief and a permanent injunction in 2004 in order to get full legal recognition and protections from the federal government. He dismissed the case a few months later due to a conflict with his lawyer, Michael Glenn of Honolulu. Before the dismissal, however the defendants U.S. government filed a 37-page Motion to Dismiss. Roger has both the original injunction and the government&#x27;s 37 pages of legal &quot;chess moves&quot; to use to refile the case at an appropriate time. &quot;God, that&#x27;s great.&quot;

===Investigation===

In 2008, an undercover law enforcement officer was introduced to Roger Christie, and on three separate occasions at the ministry, Christie sold quantities of marijuana to him (the largest being one-half pound).

Thereafter, a court-authorized wiretap on three telephone lines used by Roger Christie from April to July 2009 resulted in the interception and recording of numerous telephone conversations involving Roger and Sherryanne Christie, ministry employees, and other persons. According to Christie, investigators monitored 17,000 phone calls during a two-year period.

On March 20, 2010, Federal agents raided the downtown Hilo sanctuary of Christie&#x27;s Hawaii Cannabis Ministry, assisted by local police. Christie said authorities spent about seven hours searching his home and ministry, starting around 6 a.m. He said the Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Postal Inspector and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service were involved in the search.

A three-count sealed indictment in June, 2010 charged Christie with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 100 marijuana plants, manufacturing marijuana and possession with the intent to distribute 240 marijuana plants.

===Arrest and incarceration===

Christie was arrested on Thursday July 8, 2010, along with 13 others from the Big Island, and charged with possession and sale of cannabis. According to court documents, authorities confiscated approximately 30 ounces (845 grams) of processed marijuana in the Wainaku apartment and more than $34,000 cash from the apartment and a bank safe deposit box. The money and the apartment face possible federal forfeiture. Christie&#x27;s arrest culminated a two-year investigation by federal and county law enforcement during which they seized 2,296 marijuana plants, nine weapons, 33 pounds of processed marijuana, and four properties from Christie and his co-defendants. Federal authorities said this was a huge pot-growing and selling organization masquerading as a religious group. Agents seized about 3 thousand plants with a street value of nearly $5 million.

After his arrest, Christie was taken to Oahu and incarcerated at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center. All other detainees were speedily released on bail or signature bond before trial. But Hawaii Federal District Court Judge Alan Kay ruled that Christie must remain in federal custody until his trial.

The prosecution argued that Christie should not be released on bail because he is a danger to the community. The court accepted this argument because marijuana was found again in a new search of Christie&#x27;s home in June 2010, leading the court to conclude that Christie would continue to violate the law while out on bail. As quoted in the Star-Advertiser on Feb. 24, Judge Alan Kay remarked: &quot;You would think the light would come on when the first search of his residence was made.&quot; Judge Kay&#x27;s ruling was upheld by 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.

On Jan. 17, 2013, a federal grand jury in Honolulu returned an updated indictment against Christie and seven co-defendants. The indictment includes additional charges for three sales of marijuana to an undercover officer during 2008 and two charges of his failure to file income tax returns for 2008 and 2009,&quot; Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Kawahara, the lead prosecutor, said.

===Political support===

On March 21, 2013, The Hawaii Senate Committee on Public Safety, Intergovernmental and Military Affairs heard and passed Senate Concurrent Resolutions SCR75 and SR42, &quot;urging the federal government to release Roger Christie pending trial.&quot;

On April 3, 2013, Roger Christie was visited by Senator Russell Ruderman and Senator Will Espero at the Federal Detention Center (FDC) in Honolulu. The purpose of this visit was to discuss Christie&#x27;s incarceration, health, and rights as a United States citizen under the United States Constitution. The terms of this visit specified that no media be present. Christie was denied contact with reporters from National Geographic, Newsweek, Honolulu Civil Beat, and others Senator Ruderman stated, &quot;I have known Roger for over 25 years. He is one of the most peaceful persons I know. To anyone who knows him, the claim that he is a danger to the community is absurd.&quot; Senator Espero commented. &quot;This visit was very enlightening. I still feel that Christie should be released pending a trial.&quot;

On April 10, 2013, the Hawaii Senate Judiciary and Labor Committee heard concurrent resolutions SCR75 and SR42, &quot;urging the federal government to release Roger Christie pending trial.&quot; Hundreds of testimonies supporting the measures were received from the public. 


The committee also heard testimony from Tracy Ryan, the Vice Chair of the Hawaii Libertarian Party, who said that Roger Christie was the victim of a &quot;frightening&quot;, &quot;railroading system&quot; in which federal prosecutors have provided &quot;a lot of good lawyerly reasons... to... say that the constitution of the United States doesn&#x27;t apply to the federal system.&quot;

During the proceedings, Senator Sam Slom and Senator Russell Ruderman both spoke in support of passing the resolutions onto the senate for a full hearing. Sen. Clayton Hee, the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, acknowledged that there were &quot;many testimonies in support&quot; of the resolutions. Nevertheless, Senator Hee deferred the resolutions.

Another 2013 Hawaii Senate Resolution, SR12, called on President Obama to &quot;initiate a formal investigation into the conduct of federal law enforcement personnel in regard to the violation of the constitutional rights of Hawaii County Resident, the Reverend Roger Christie.&quot; SR12 was never scheduled for a hearing.

===Guilty plea===

Christie faced up to 40 years in a federal penitentiary if convicted at trial. He was represented by a public defender. While Christie was awaiting trial, six co-defendants made plea deals with the prosecution to cooperate with authorities.

On September 27, 2013, Christie made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty in federal court to conspiring to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute 100 or more marijuana plants. His wife, Sherryanne Christie, pleaded guilty to a similar charge but involving 50 plants or more. As part of a plea agreement, the Christies agreed to forfeit more than $21,000 in proceeds from the operation of the THC Cannabis Ministry, which operated in Hilo from 2000 until July 8, 2010, when they and 12 others were arrested. Roger Christie also agreed under duress to forfeit a condominium apartment on Kauila Street in Hilo which was a gift from his late Mother.

On April 28, 2014, U.S. District Judge Leslie Kobayashi sentenced Roger Christie to a term of five years in federal prison, with credit for the almost four years he had been incarcerated, permitting him to be released after serving 50 months in the Federal Detention Center Honolulu with no bail and no trial, no outside, no sunshine and no media contact allowed. In addition, he was sentenced to supervised release — the federal equivalent of probation — for four years after serving his prison term. The conditions of the supervised release include refraining from use of marijuana or other controlled substances or from being in the presence of using marijuana. He was subject to drug testing and always tested negative. He was allowed to appeal his sentence, but was denied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. His wife and co-defendant, Sherryanne &quot;Share&quot; Christie was sentenced to a term of 27-months. She was allowed to remain free on bail pending appeal of her sentence which was denied.
The prosecution resulted from the combined efforts from 2008 to 2010 of the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigations; Homeland Security Investigations; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the U.S. Marshals Service; the National Park Service; the Sheriff&#x27;s Office, Department of Public Safety; the Hawaii Police Department; and the Honolulu Police Department. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael K. Kawahara.

During the proceedings U.S. District Court Judge Leslie Kobayashi denied Roger&#x27;s motion that &quot;marihuana&quot; was misclassified as a Schedule 1 most dangerous substance with &quot;no recognized medical use in treatment in the U.S.A.&quot; despite medical Cannabis being legal in Hawai&#x27;i since June 2000 and in many other jurisdictions. A hopeful ruling did come when Judge Kobayashi ruled that Roger and his wife Share were &quot;sincere&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; Cannabis Ministers, but soon afterwards she denied their religious defense because she ruled that the U.S. government had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in keeping Cannabis illegal, AND that the government used the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; to deny their religious freedom. Roger and Share&#x27;s intention to have &quot;the last marijuana trial&quot; (See: www.the-last-marijuana-trial.com) was denied, and most of their evidence and witnesses were never seen or heard by the Judge or a jury.

On September 4, 2014, Roger Christie was transferred to the Mahoney Hale halfway house in Honolulu before being allowed to return to Puna on the Big Island on supervised release on November 14. 
May 2020 Roger completed his four-year federal probation with no violations. He was denied early release of probation by U.S. District Court Judge Leslie Kobayashi.

On October 11, 2016 Share Christie self-surrendered to a federal prison camp in Phoenix, Arizona to serve a 27-month sentence with an added three year probation. She was transferred back to the Federal Detention Center Honolulu in April 2017 where she was held until released to the Orion Halfway House in Los Angeles on August 7, 2018. Share was allowed to live with her parents on September 21, 2018 where she chose to stay until coming home to Hilo on January 15, 2020. 
Her probation officially ends on September 21, 2021. She was denied early termination of her probation by Judge Kobayashi in January 2020. She recently filed another motion for early termination of probation, this time doing it pro se, without a lawyer. The U.S. government strongly opposed her early release, again. She&#x27;s expecting an answer from the judge in June 2020.

Roger wrote a chapter in the book called Cannabis and Spirituality by Stephen Gray. He, his wife Share and others are featured in the book called God On High by Professor of Religion Laurie Cozad.

Roger is planning to restart the THC Ministry in June 2020 mostly online, but without the distribution of Cannabis sacrament until he &quot;wins a federal injunction, or better&quot;. Ministry membership, Letters of Good Standing, Sanctuary Kits, hemp prayer shawls, I.D. cards and other THC Ministry gear will be available once again to sincere spiritual users of Cannabis.

<doc id="576048" wikidata="Q11542484" url="?curid=576048" title="Knock Yokoyama">
<text>was a Japanese politician and comedian.

Born Isamu Yamada (山田勇 &quot;Yamada Isamu&quot;) in Asahikawa (Hokkaido), he adopted his current stage name while directing the &quot;Manga Trio&quot; manzai troupe from 1959 to 1968. Following his comedy years, he went into the construction industry and served as a director at several major construction firms in the Kansai region.

He became governor of Osaka prefecture in 1995, running as an independent and joining the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after his election. He enjoyed great popularity as governor, mostly due to his existing fame as a comedian.

In 2000, a 21-year-old campaign volunteer accused Yokoyama of sexual harassment, claiming that the governor groped her for 30 minutes in the back of a campaign truck. Yokoyama denied the charges, but the Osaka District Court found him liable for ¥11 million in damages, following a highly publicized trial in which the plaintiff testified from behind an opaque screen to avoid revealing her identity. Following the judgment, Yokoyama resigned: he was replaced by a female LDP bureaucrat, Fusae Ohta.

<text>Affair in Trinidad is a 1952 American film noir directed by Vincent Sherman and starring Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. It was produced by Hayworth&#x27;s Beckworth Corporation and released by Columbia Pictures.

It is notable as Hayworth&#x27;s &quot;comeback&quot; film after four years away from Columbia, as a reteaming of the stars of &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946) and for a fiery opening number in which Hayworth dances barefoot to calypso music. Hayworth&#x27;s singing voice is dubbed by Jo Ann Greer, who later also sang for her in &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson&quot; and &quot;Pal Joey&quot;. The film&#x27;s gross take at the box office exceeded &quot;Gilda&quot;&#x27;s by $1 million.

==Plot==
Chris Emery works as a nightclub singer and dancer in the British colony of Trinidad and Tobago. One night after her performance she receives news from Inspector Smythe and Anderson, a member of the American consulate, that her husband Neil has been found dead. She is comforted by Neil&#x27;s friend Max Fabian.

Initially, the police conclude that Neil committed suicide based on his gunshot wound and the discovery of a pistol at the crime scene, but on further investigation, they believe that he was murdered. Smythe and Anderson take Chris into their confidence and inform her that Neil&#x27;s boat was seen outside Fabian&#x27;s property at the time of Neil&#x27;s murder. Chris learns that Fabian is a crook who has built his fortune by trading information and aiding in treason. Thus, Neil could have been murdered because of his involvement in Fabian&#x27;s latest project to allow Nazis to launch rockets from Trinidad to attack the United States. Chris agrees to exploit Fabian&#x27;s love for her to gather information for the police.

Neil&#x27;s brother Steve Emery arrives in Trinidad at the request of his late brother, who had written to him about a prospective job. Steve is shocked to learn that Neil committed suicide shortly after writing to him and sets out to investigate matters on his own. After the inquest, Chris and Steve spend time together and she begins to fall in love with him, but she cannot reveal her motive behind getting friendly with Fabian.

At a party at Fabian&#x27;s estate, Steve recognizes Walters as a man who sat next to him on his flight to Trinidad and became agitated at the mention of his brother&#x27;s name. Since Walters&#x27; portion of research has been completed, Fabian judges him a liability and has him killed by a hit-and-run driver. This increases the authorities&#x27; suspicion of him.

As Chris inches closer to discovering the truth about Fabian, Steve gathers proof of Fabian&#x27;s involvement in Neil&#x27;s death, leading to a climactic showdown. During the struggle for a gun, Fabian is accidentally shot in the stomach. Sensing his wound might prove fatal, he orders his accomplices to take the secrets and leave him behind. But local authorities have surrounded the estate and they are either killed or captured. Steve finishes Fabian off in a climactic gunfight; and with Chris cleared, they leave for Chicago.

==Cast==
==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther panned the film as &quot;as apparent and monotonous as a phonograph record on which the needle is stuck before it has traveled half the distance of the hour and forty minutes that it runs.&quot; Crowther was especially critical of Hayworth&#x27;s performance: &quot;[T]he demurely returning Miss Hayworth proves no bargain after an absence of four years. In that time, we had probably forgotten what a mediocre actress she is, and now the bald fact—politely winked at in the past—hits one right between the eyes. Tawny she is and sometimes handsome in a highly shellacked and tailored way, but her acting is vastly unexpressive of anything but the postures of a doll. And the dancing she does in this picture makes her look both vulgar and grotesque.&quot;

The film earned an estimated $2.7 million at the North American box office in 1952.

The film was nominated for Best Costume Design, Black and White at the 25th Academy Awards.

<doc id="576061" wikidata="Q1033073" url="?curid=576061" title="Candombe">
<text>Candombe is a style of music and dance that originated in Uruguay among the descendants of liberated African slaves. In 2009, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) inscribed &quot;candombe&quot; in its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

To a lesser extent, &quot;candombe&quot; is practiced in Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. In Argentina, it can be found in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Paraná, and Corrientes. In Paraguay, this tradition continues in Camba Cuá and in Fernando de la Mora near Asunción. In Brazil, &quot;candombe&quot; retains its religious character and can be found in the states of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.

This Uruguayan music style is based on three different drums: chico, repique, and piano drums. It is usually played in February during carnival in Montevideo at dance parades called &quot;llamadas&quot; and &quot;desfile inaugural del carnaval&quot;.

== Origins ==

=== Common origins ===

According to George Reid Andrews, a historian of black communities in Latin America, after the middle of the 19th century younger black people began to abandon the &quot;candombe&quot; in favor of practicing European dances such as the waltz, schottische, and mazurka. Following this new twist, other Uruguayans began to imitate the steps and movements. Calling themselves Los Negros, upper class porteños in the 1860s and 1870s performed blackface and formed one of the carnival processions each year.

African-Uruguayans organized candombe dances every Sunday and on special holidays such as New Year&#x27;s Eve, Christmas, Saint Baltasar, Rosary Virgin and Saint Benito. They would set a fire to heat the drums and play candombe music, especially during the night in certain neighborhoods such as Barrio Sur and Palermo in Montevideo.

The typical characters on the parade represent the old white masters during slavery in old Montevideo city. It was a mockery to their lifestyle with a rebel spirit for freedom and a way to remember the African origins.

In 1913, an anonymous dance historian identified only as &quot;Viejo Tanguero&quot; (&quot;Old Tangoer&quot;) wrote about the 1877 creation of a dance referred to as a &quot;tango&quot; but featuring ideas from the &quot;candombe&quot;. This dance, which later became known as &quot;soft tango,&quot; was created by African Argentines.

Writing in 1883, dance scholar and folklorist Ventura Lynch described the influence of Afro-Argentine dancers on the &quot;compadritos&quot; (&quot;tough guys&quot;) who apparently frequented Afro-Argentine dance venues. Lynch wrote, &quot;the milonga is danced only by the &quot;compadritos&quot; of the city, who have created it as a mockery of the dances the blacks hold in their own places&quot;. Lynch&#x27;s report was interpreted by Robert Farris Thompson in &quot;Tango: The Art of Love&quot; as meaning that city &quot;compadritos&quot; danced milonga, not rural gauchos. Thompson notes that the population of city toughs dancing milonga would have included blacks and mulattoes, and that it would not have been danced as a mockery by all the dancers.

=== In Argentina ===

The seeds of candombe originated in present-day Angola, where it was taken to South America during the 17th and 18th centuries by people who had been sold as slaves in the kingdom of Kongo, Anziqua, Nyong, Quang and others, mainly by Portuguese slave traders. The same cultural carriers of candombe colonized Brazil (especially in the area of Salvador de Bahia), Cuba, and the Río de la Plata with its capital Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The different histories and experiences in these regions branched out from the common origin, giving rise to different rhythms.

The African influence was not foreign to Argentina, where the candombe also has been developed with specific characteristics. A population of black African slaves had been present in Buenos Aires since around 1580. However, miscegenation with an increasingly white population (as Argentina received up to 6 million European immigrants) and structural racism (such as state-sponsored &quot;blanqueamiento&quot; policies) led to the progressive invisibilization of the Afro-Argentine population.

In Buenos Aires, during the two governments of Juan Manuel de Rosas, it was common for “&quot;afroporteños&quot;” (black people of Buenos Aires) to perform candombe in public, even encouraged and visited by Rosas and his daughter, Manuela. Rosas was defeated at the battle of Caseros in 1852, and Buenos Aires began a profound and rapid cultural shift which saw a bigger emphasis on European culture. In this context, afroporteños replicated their ancestral cultural patterns increasingly into their private life. For this reason, onwards from 1862, the press, intellectuals and politicians began to assert the misconception of Afro-Argentine disappearance that has remained in the imagination of ordinary people from Argentina.

Many researchers agree that the Candombe, through the development of the Milonga, is an essential component in the genesis of the tango. This musical rhythm influenced, especially the &quot;Sureña Milonga&quot;. In fact, tango, milonga and candombe form a musical triptych from the same African roots, but with different developments.

Initially, the practice of Candombe was practiced exclusively by black people, who had designed special places called “Tangós”. This word originated sometime in the 19th century the word &quot;Tango&quot;, but at that time not yet with its present meaning. Today, candombe is still practiced by Afro-Argentine and non-black populations across Argentina. In Corrientes Province, candombe is part of the religious feast of San Baltasar, a folk patron saint for Black Argentines.

=== In Uruguay ===
The word &quot;candombe&quot; comes from a Kikongo word meaning &quot;pertaining to blacks,&quot; and was originally used in Buenos Aires to refer to dancing societies formed by members of the African diaspora and their descendants. It came to refer to the dance style in general, and the term was adopted in Uruguay as well. In Uruguay, &quot;candombe&quot; fused multiple African dance traditions into a complex choreography. Movements are energetic, and steps are improvised to suit.

== Present ==

=== Argentina ===

Lately, some artists have incorporated this genre to their compositions, and have also created groups and NGOs of Afro-descendants, as the Misibamba Association, Afro-Argentines of Buenos Aires Community. However, it is important to note that the Uruguayan Candombe is the most practiced in Argentina, both due to immigration from Uruguay and to the seductiveness of the rhythm that captivates the Argentines. For this reason they learn the music, dance and characters and recreate something similar. Uruguayan Candombe is played much in the neighborhoods of San Telmo, Montserrat and La Boca.

While the Argentine variety had less local diffusion (compared with the diffusion that occurred in Uruguay), mainly by the decrease of population of black African origin, its mixing with white immigrants and the prohibition of the carnival during the last dictatorship. The Afroargentine Candombe is only played by the Afro-Argentines in the privacy of their homes, mainly located in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

Recently, due to a change in strategy by the Afro-Argentines to move from concealment to visibility, there are increased efforts to perform it in public places, onstage and in street parades. Among the groups who play Afroargentine Candombe are: “Tambores del Litoral” (union of “Balikumba” from Santa Fe, and “Candombes del Litoral” from Parana, Entre Ríos), “Bakongo” (these, have their own web page), the “Comparsa Negros Argentinos” and &quot;Grupo Bum Ke Bum (both from Asociación Misibamba). The latter two are in Gran Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires City and its surroundings).

=== Uruguay ===

In the late 1960s and early 1970s candombe was mixed with elements from 60s pop music and bossa nova to create a new genre called candombe beat. The origin of this genre was largely said to be the work of Eduardo Mateo, a Uruguayan singer, songwriter and musician together with other musicians such as Jorge Galemire. This style was later adopted by Jaime Roos and also heavily influenced Jorge Drexler. Contemporary musicians like Diego Janssen and Miguel del Aguila are experimenting with fusing candombe with classical genres, jazz, blues and milonga.

== Instruments and musical features ==

=== Uruguayan candombe ===


Inscribed in 2009 on the Representative UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List, the candombe is a source of pride and a symbol of the identity of communities of African descent in Montevideo, embraced by younger generations and favouring group cohesion, while expressing the communities’ needs and feelings with regard to their ancestors.

The music of &quot;candombe&quot; is performed by a group of drummers called a cuerda. The barrel-shaped drums, or tamboriles, have specific names according to their size and function:

* chico, small, high timbre, serving as the rhythmic pendulum
* repique, medium, embellishes candombe&#x27;s rhythm with improvised phrases
* piano, largest size, its function similar to that of the upright or electric bass

An even larger drum, called &quot;bajo&quot; or &quot;bombo&quot; (very large, very low timbre, accent on the fourth beat), was once common but is now declining in use. A &quot;cuerda&quot; at a minimum needs three drummers, one on each part. A full cuerda will have 50–100 drummers, commonly with rows of seven or five drummers, mixing the three types of drums. A typical row of five can be piano-chico-repique-chico-piano, with the row behind having repique-chico-piano-chico-repique and so on to the last row.

Tamboriles are made of wood with animal skins that are rope-tuned or fire-tuned minutes before the performance. They are worn at the waist with the aid of a shoulder strap called a &quot;talig&quot; or &quot;talí&quot; and played with one stick and one hand.

A key rhythmic figure in &quot;candombe&quot; is the clave (in 3–2 form). It is played on the side of the drum, a procedure known as &quot;hacer madera&quot; (literally, &quot;making wood&quot;).

====Master candombe drummers ====

Among the most important and traditional Montevidean rhythms are: Cuareim, Ansina and Cordon. There are several master drummers who have kept Candombe alive uninterrupted for two hundred years. Some of highlights are: in Ansina school: Wáshington Ocampo, Héctor Suárez, Pedro &quot;Perico&quot; Gularte, Eduardo &quot;Cacho&quot; Giménez, Julio Giménez, Raúl &quot;Pocho&quot; Magariños, Rubén Quirós, Alfredo Ferreira, &quot;Tito&quot; Gradín, Raúl &quot;Maga&quot; Magariños, Luis &quot;Mocambo&quot; Quirós, Fernando &quot;Hurón&quot; Silva, Eduardo &quot;Malumba&quot; Gimenez, Alvaro Salas, Daniel Gradín, Sergio Ortuño y José Luis Giménez.

=== Argentine Candombe ===

The Afro-Argentine Candombe is played with two types of drums, played exclusively by men. Those drums are: “llamador” (also called &quot;base&quot;, &quot;tumba&quot;, &quot;quinto&quot; or &quot;tumba base&quot;), and &quot;repicador&quot; (also called &quot;contestador&quot;, &quot;repiqueteador&quot; or &quot;requinto&quot;). The first is a bass drum, and the second is a sharp drum. There are two models of each of the drums: one made in hollowed trunk, and the other made with staves.

The first type are hung with a strap on the shoulder and are played in a street parade. The latter are higher than those, and played for granted. Both types of drums, are played only with both hands. Sometimes others drums are played: the &quot;macú&quot; and the &quot;sopipa&quot;. Both are made from hollowed tree trunk, the first is performed lying on the floor, as it is the largest and deepest drum; and the &quot;Sopipa&quot; which is small and acute, is played hung on the shoulder or held between the knees.

Among the idiophones that always accompany the drums are the &quot;taba&quot; and &quot;mazacalla&quot;, being able to add: the &quot;quijada&quot;, the &quot;quisanche&quot;, and the &quot;chinesco”. The Argentine Candombe is a vocal-instrumental practice, all the same to be played sitting or street parade. There is a large repertoire of songs in African languages archaic, in Spanish or in a combination of both. They are usually structured in the form of dialogue and are interpreted solo, responsorial, antiphonal or in group. Although singing is usually a feminine practice, men may be involved. Where there is more than one voice, they are always in unison.

== Uruguayan Candombe performance ==

A full &quot;Candombe&quot; group, collectively known as a Comparsa Lubola (composed of blackened white people, traditionally with burnt corks) or Candombera (composed of black people), constitutes the &quot;cuerda&quot;, a group of female dancers known as mulatas, and several stock characters, each with their own specific dances. The stock characters include:
* La Mama Vieja: the Old Mother.
* El Gramillero: the Herb doctor. an ancient black man, dressed in top hat and frock coat, carrying a bag of herbs.
* El Escobero: the Broomsman, He has to be an expert &quot;candombero&quot; and graceful dancer, who performs extraordinary feats and of juggling and balance with his broom.

Candombe is performed regularly in the streets of old Montevideo&#x27;s south neighbourhood in January and February, during Uruguay&#x27;s Carnival period, and also in the rest of the country. All the &quot;comparsas&quot;, of which there are 80 or 90 in existence, participate in a massive Carnival parade called Las Llamadas (&quot;calls&quot;) and vie with each other in official competitions in the &quot;Teatro de Verano&quot; theatre. During Las Llamadas, members of the comparsa often wear costumes that reflect the music&#x27;s historical roots in the slave trade, such as sun hats and black face-paint. The monetary prizes are modest; more important aspects include enjoyment, the fostering of a sense of pride and the winning of respect from peers. 
Intense performances can cause damage to red blood cells, which manifests as rust-colored urine immediately after drumming.

<text>Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow (; 22 August 1860 – 24 August 1940) was a German electrical engineer and inventor. He invented the Nipkow disk, which laid the foundation of television, since his disk was a fundamental component in the first televisions. Hundreds of stations experimented with television broadcasting using his disk in the 1920s and 1930s, until it was superseded by all-electronic systems in the 1940s.

Nipkow has been called the &quot;father of television&quot;, together with other early figures of television history like Karl Ferdinand Braun.

The first regular television service in the world, Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow, was named in his honour.

==Beginnings==
Nipkow was born in Lauenburg (now Lębork) in the Prussian province of Pomerania, now part of Poland. While at school in neighbouring Neustadt (now Wejherowo), in the province of West Prussia, Nipkow experimented in telephony and the transmission of moving pictures. After graduation, he went to Berlin in order to study science. He studied physiological optics with Hermann von Helmholtz, and electro-physics with Adolf Slaby.

== Nipkow disk ==
While still a student he conceived an &quot;electric telescope&quot;, mainly known for the idea of using a spiral-perforated disk (Nipkow disk), to divide a picture into a linear sequence of points. Accounts of its invention state that the idea came to him while sitting alone at home with an oil lamp on Christmas Eve, 1883. Alexander Bain had transmitted images telegraphically in the 1840s but the Nipkow disk improved the encoding process.

He applied to the imperial patent office in Berlin for a patent covering an &quot;electric telescope&quot; for the &quot;electric reproduction of illuminating objects&quot;, in the category &quot;electric apparatuses&quot;. This was granted on 15 January 1885, retroactive to 6 January 1884. It is not known whether Nipkow ever attempted a practical realization of this disk, but one may assume that he himself never constructed one. The patent lapsed after 15 years owing to lack of interest. Nipkow took up a position as a designer at an institute in Berlin-Buchloh and did not continue work on the broadcasting of pictures.

== First TV systems ==
The first television broadcasts used an optical-mechanical picture scanning method, the method that Nipkow had helped create with his disk; he could claim credit for the invention. Nipkow recounted his first sight of television at a Berlin radio show in 1928: &quot;The televisions stood in dark cells. Hundreds stood and waited patiently for the moment at which they would see television for the first time. I waited among them, growing ever more nervous. Now for the first time, I would see what I had devised 45 years ago. Finally, I reached the front row; a dark cloth was pushed to the side, and I saw before me a flickering image, not easy to discern.&quot; The system demonstrated was from the company Telefunken.

From the early 1930s, total electronic picture scanning, based on the work of Manfred von Ardenne, became increasingly prevalent, and Nipkow&#x27;s invention was no longer essential to the further development of television.

== &quot;Paul Nipkow&quot; Transmitter ==
The world&#x27;s first regular television service, started in Berlin in 1935, was named Fernsehsender &quot;Paul Nipkow&quot; after Nipkow – the &quot;spiritual father&quot; of the core element of first-generation television technology. He became honorary president of the &quot;television council&quot; of the &quot;Imperial Broadcasting Chamber&quot;. Nipkow&#x27;s glory was used by Hitler and the Nazi government as a tool of National Socialist scientific propaganda. Nipkow died in Berlin in 1940 two days after his 80th birthday and had an official ceremony organised by the Nazi government.

<text>Ptolemy IX Soter II (, &quot;Ptolemaĩos Sōtḗr&quot; &#x27;Ptolemy the Saviour&#x27;), commonly nicknamed Lathyros (Λάθυρος, &quot;Láthuros&quot; &#x27;chickpea&#x27;), was twice King of Ptolemaic Egypt. He was the son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. He reigned as Ptolemy Philometor Soter in joint rule with his grandmother Cleopatra II and mother Cleopatra III from 116 to 107 BC, and then again as Ptolemy Soter from 88 to 81 BC.

Ptolemy IX became the heir apparent after the murder of his half-brother Ptolemy Memphites in 130 BC, during a civil war between Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II. On his father&#x27;s death in 116 BC, he became co-regent with Cleopatra II (until 115 BC) and with Cleopatra III. He eventually quarrelled with his mother and in 107 BC, she deposed him and replaced him with his younger brother, Ptolemy X. However, Ptolemy IX succeeded in seizing control of Cyprus. From there he invaded Judaea, but was prevented by Ptolemy X from invading Egypt (103–102 BC). In 88 BC, the Alexandrians expelled Ptolemy X and restored Ptolemy IX to the throne. He reigned alone until 81 BC, when he appointed his daughter Berenice III as co-regent shortly before his own death. She succeeded him as ruler.

==Background and early life==

When the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy V died in 180 BC, he left three children: Ptolemy VI, Cleopatra II, and Ptolemy VIII. All three ruled together from 169 BC until 164 BC, when Ptolemy VIII expelled his brother from power. In 163 BC, he was expelled in turn and forced to withdraw to Cyrene. However, when Ptolemy VI died in 145 BC, Ptolemy VIII was invited back to Egypt to serve as king, marrying his sister Cleopatra II, also sister and widow of Ptolemy VI. The relationship between Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II rapidly deteriorated, especially when Ptolemy VIII took Cleopatra III, daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, as a second wife. The conflict eventually led to a civil war with Cleopatra II on one side and Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III on the other (132-126 BC). Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III were victorious, but reconciled with Cleopatra II and restored her as co-regent in 124 BC.

Ptolemy IX was the son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. The exact date of his birth is a bit unclear. As pharaoh, his Horus name was &quot;Distinguished through his birth together with the living Apis; twin in his birthplace with the son of Isis&quot; which seems to indicate that he was born in the same year as an Apis bull, i.e. 143/2 BC. This would put his birth two years before his parents&#x27; marriage, which took place in 141 BC. Some historians, like Günther Hölbl, consider this insuperable and propose to place his birth in 140 or 139 BC instead.

Initially, Ptolemy IX was not the heir to the throne – that was Ptolemy Memphites, the son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, who was roughly the same age as him. In 134/3 BC, Ptolemy IX served as the annual priest of Alexander the Great, the year after Ptolemy Memphites had done the same. However, during the civil war, in 130 BC, Cleopatra II attempted to have Ptolemy Memphites crowned as her co-ruler, so Ptolemy VIII had him murdered, leaving Ptolemy IX as the heir.

Around 117 BC, Ptolemy IX was sent to Cyprus, reportedly at his mother&#x27;s request, where he served as governor of the island (&quot;strategos, nauarchos, archiereus, archikynegos&quot;). Shortly before this he had married his sister Cleopatra IV, who probably gave birth to two sons while the couple was on Cyprus: the future Ptolemy XII in 117 BC and Ptolemy, future king of Cyprus, .

==First reign (116–107 BC)==
===Will of Ptolemy VIII===

On 28 June 116, Ptolemy VIII died. According to Justin, Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s will left Cleopatra III in charge of Egypt, with the right to choose either Ptolemy IX or his younger brother Ptolemy X as her co-regent. Cyrene was left to Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s illegitimate son, Ptolemy Apion. Justin further claims that Cleopatra III wanted to choose Ptolemy X, but the people of Alexandria rioted and forced her to choose Ptolemy IX. Pausanias implies that Cleopatra III&#x27;s request to send Ptolemy IX to Cyprus in 117 BC had been intended to get him out of the way in order to enable Ptolemy X&#x27;s succession.

Some historians have found this account plausible. However, Chris Bennett argues that it is a false story that was invented by Cleopatra III at a later date. He points out that Justin&#x27;s story assumes that Cleopatra III was the only living queen at the time of Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s death. Documentary evidence shows that Cleopatra II was still alive in 116 BC, which makes it unlikely that Cleopatra III would have been allowed sole power to decide who would be king.

At any rate, Cleopatra II, Cleopatra III, and Ptolemy IX (in that order) are listed together as co-rulers in surviving papyrus documents from October 116 BC. Ptolemy IX received the epithet &quot;Philometor Soter&quot; (Mother-loving Saviour). This was the same epithet that Cleopatra II and taken on during her civil war with Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III, which suggests that she played a controlling role in the new regime. Ptolemy X was sent to Cyprus to serve as governor of Cyprus soon after Ptolemy IX&#x27;s accession.

===Divorce, remarriage, and intervention in Seleucid civil war===
Cleopatra II died some time before April 115 BC and at this point Cleopatra III became the dominant force in the government. Ptolemy IX was forced to divorce his sister-wife Cleopatra IV, who went off and married her cousin, the Seleucid king Antiochus IX (r. 115–95 BC), whose mother Cleopatra Thea was Cleopatra III&#x27;s sister. Antiochus IX was waging a war against his half-brother Antiochus VIII (r. 125–96 BC), who was married to Cleopatra IV&#x27;s elder sister Tryphaena. On the way to meet Antiochus IX, Cleopatra IV stopped in Cyprus, where she recruited an army and seized control of the Cypriot fleet, in order to aid Antiochus IX. Perhaps as a result of this, in 114/113 BC, Ptolemy X proclaimed himself &#x27;King of Cyprus&#x27;, openly declaring his opposition to Ptolemy IX.

Meanwhile, Ptolemy IX married his younger sister, Cleopatra Selene, with whom he soon had a daughter, Berenice III. Cleopatra Selene was not made co-regent with her new husband, as would have been normal. Instead, in documents from this period, the royal couple were Cleopatra III and Ptolemy IX, who were integrated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult as the &quot;Theoi Philometores Soteres&quot; (The Mother-loving Saviour Gods).

Ptolemy IX supported Antiochus IX in his conflict with Antiochus VIII. In 114 BC, Cleopatra IV had been captured and murdered by Antiochus VIII&#x27;s wife Tryphaena, who was murdered in turn by Antiochus IX in 111 BC. In 109 BC, Ptolemy IX sent Antiochus IX fresh troops to aid him in a campaign against the Jewish ruler Hyrcanus I of the Hasmonean dynasty.

===Expulsion from Alexandria===
In autumn 107 BC, a new conflict broke out between Cleopatra III and Ptolemy IX. Pausanias claims that Cleopatra III wounded a number of her own eunuch servants and displayed them to the people as evidence that her son had attempted to have her assassinated, causing the Alexandrians to riot and expel Ptolemy IX from the city. While this was taking place, Ptolemy X had left Cyprus and sailed to Pelusium. Cleopatra III then had him brought to Alexandria and placed on the throne as her new co-regent. Ptolemy IX had left his two sons behind when he fled Alexandria. He also abandoned Cleopatra Selene, who now seems to have been married to Ptolemy X.

==King of Cyprus (107–88 BC)==
After his expulsion from Alexandria, Ptolemy IX went to the isle of Cyprus. There forces loyal to Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X rebuffed him, forcing him to retreat to Seleucia in Pieria. From there he mounted another invasion of Cyprus in 106 BC, which succeeded in conquering the island. He initially maintained control of Cyrene, but it seems to have come under the control of his half brother Ptolemy Apion some time after 105 BC. Apion protected his position by publishing a will which left all his territories to Rome in the event that he died without heirs, a method which was often used by Hellenistic kings to prevent rivals from attempting to depose or assassinate them. However, he actually died without heirs in 96 BC, meaning that Rome inherited the territory.

In 103 BC, the new Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus led an army to conquer Ptolemais Akko. The city appealed to Ptolemy IX for help and he sailed over and caused Jannaeus to lift his siege. He then invaded Galilee, defeated Jannaeus in a battle at Asophon near the River Jordan, and despoiled Judaea with impunity. Fearing that Ptolemy IX was planning to use Judaea as a springboard for an invasion of Egypt, Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X invaded Judaea themselves. Ptolemy X invaded Phoenicia by sea and then marched inland to Damascus, while Cleopatra III besieged Ptolemais Akko. Ptolemy IX attempted to slip past them and into Egypt, but Ptolemy X managed to rush back and stop him. Ptolemy IX spent the winter encamped at Gaza, before deciding to sail back to Cyprus in early 102 BC. Nothing further is known about his activities until 88 BC.

==Second reign (88–81 BC)==
===Restoration===

The army and people of Alexandria turned against Ptolemy X in spring 88 BC and expelled him from Egypt. The Alexandrians then recalled Ptolemy IX to the throne. Ptolemy IX was formally re-crowned as Pharaoh at Memphis in November. In his first reign, Ptolemy had borne the epithet &quot;Philometor Soter&quot; (Mother-loving saviour), but on his return he dropped the &quot;Philometor&quot;, since it recalled his mother. The cults and memory of Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X seem to have been officially suppressed.

When Ptolemy IX returned to Egypt, the south of the country had been under the control of Egyptian rebels since 91 BC. Ptolemy sent a large force south in November 88 BC, under the command of the general Hierax. Thebes was quickly recaptured and severely sacked. Ptolemaic control was restored as far south as Philae, but Lower Nubia, which had come under the control of the kingdom of Meroe during the revolt, was not reclaimed.

===Roman claims and First Mithridatic War===
After his expulsion from Alexandria, Ptolemy X made an attempt to invade Cyprus and recapture control, but was killed in the attempt. Before his death, however, he had taken out a large loan from the Roman Republic, in return for which he produced a will which left his kingdom to the Romans. Although they chose not to take advantage of this, the possibility of Roman intervention hung over Ptolemy IX for the rest of his reign and forced him to adopt a highly deferential posture with the Romans.

In 86 BC, a Roman fleet commanded by Lucullus arrived in Alexandria seeking financial and military support against Mithridates VI of Pontus, with whom the Romans were fighting the First Mithridatic War (89-84 BC). Ptolemy hosted Lucullus magnificently, but did not offer him any material support. This was probably partially due to the confused political situation – the Roman war effort was being led by Sulla, but he had been declared an outlaw by the government in Rome led by Lucius Cornelius Cinna. Moreover, Mithridates VI had managed to capture Ptolemy&#x27;s sons, who had been on Cos since 103 BC.

===Death and succession===
On 5 August 81 BC, Ptolemy IX promoted his daughter Berenice III, who had previously been the wife and co-regent of Ptolemy X, to the status of co-regent. Some sources claim that Ptolemy IX had made Berenice III his co-regent at the start of his second reign in 88 BC, but all documentary evidence shows that he reigned alone until 81BC. Ptolemy died shortly thereafter, probably in December of the same year, leaving her alone on the throne. After a few months of sole rule, her cousin Ptolemy XI was placed on the throne as her co-regent, murdered her, was murdered himself, and was replaced by Ptolemy XII, another child of Ptolemy IX.

==Regime==
In August 115 BC, Ptolemy IX travelled down the Nile to Elephantine in order to celebrate the festival there in honour of the Great God of the Nile – a traditional Pharaonic duty which was meant to give thanks for the inundation and ensure the success of the next. The fact that Ptolemy IX carried this ritual out personally, rather than letting a local priest carry it out in his stead, shows the extent to which Ptolemy embraced the Pharaonic role.

It is possible that construction of certain buildings occurred during the first reign of Ptolemy IX. This would have included work on the Dendera Temple complex and on the temple in Edfu.

===Relationship with Rome===
A Roman embassy led by the senator Lucius Memmius, arrived in Egypt in 112 BC. As part of his visit, he was given a tour of the Fayyum region. Papyrus letters survive that instruct all local officials to treat him with the greatest respect and provide him with the most luxurious accommodation. The visit is a sign of the extent to which the Ptolemies now sought to conciliate the Roman Republic. It is also an early example of Roman tourism in Egypt, which would become a major phenomenon in the Roman imperial period. A set of four graffiti at Philae provide evidence for another set of early Roman tourists. Dated to 116 BC, they are the earliest known examples of the Latin language to be found in Egypt.

==Marriages and issue==

Ptolemy IX is only known to have married twice, first to Cleopatra IV from until he was forced to divorce her in 115 BC, and secondly to Cleopatra Selene from 115 BC, until he abandoned her during his flight from Alexandria in 107 BC.

At least three children are attested for Ptolemy IX. The birth dates and parentage of his two sons Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus are disputed. According to Justin, Cleopatra Selene and Ptolemy IX had two children. The historian John Whitehorne noted that the existence of those two children is doubted and they might have died at a young age.

Ptolemy XII is referred to by Cicero and other ancient sources as an illegitimate son; Pompeius Trogus called him a &quot;nothos&quot; (bastard), while Pausanias wrote that Berenice III was Ptolemy IX&#x27;s only legitimate offspring. This has discouraged the identification of Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus with the two sons mentioned by Justin. Michael Grant suggested that Ptolemy XII&#x27;s mother was a Syrian or a partly Greek concubine while Günther Hölbl suggested that she was a member of the Egyptian elite. However, John Pentland Mahaffy and Christopher Bennett argue that they were considered illegitimate simply because their mother had not been a co-regnant queen. They propose Cleopatra IV as the mother, in which case Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus would have been born in 117 and 116 BC respectively. Bennett further proposes that Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus are identical with the two sons mentioned by Justin.

The mother of Ptolemy IX&#x27;s daughter, Berenice III is not certain either. Cleopatra IV and Cleopatra Selene are candidates, with the former favoured by modern scholarship. Bennett noted that Berenice III&#x27;s legitimacy was never questioned by ancient historians, and the illegitimacy of Ptolemy IX and Cleopatra IV&#x27;s marriage makes it more probable that Berenice III was the result of a legitimate marriage, that is between her father and Cleopatra Selene.

<doc id="576092" wikidata="Q1417601" url="?curid=576092" title="Jon Spencer Blues Explosion">
<text>The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was an American three-piece rock band from New York City, formed in 1991. The group consisted of Judah Bauer on guitar, backing vocals, harmonica and occasional lead vocals, Russell Simins on drums and Jon Spencer on vocals, guitar and theremin. Their musical style is largely rooted in rock and roll although it draws influences from punk, blues, garage, rockabilly, soul, noise rock, rhythm and blues and hip hop. 

The band released nine official studio albums, collaborative records with Dub Narcotic Sound System and R.L. Burnside as well as numerous live, singles, out-take albums, compilations, remix albums and, in 2010, a series of expanded reissues. Throughout the course of their career, this experimental sound and occasionally unconventional recording techniques has allowed the band to work with such artists as Elliott Smith, Beck, Solomon Burke, Steve Albini, Martina Topley-Bird, and Mike D of the Beastie Boys.

==History==
===Formation===
Originally from Hanover, New Hampshire, US, Jon Spencer attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island where he was part of the noise rock band Shithaus, with Tod Ashley (Cop Shoot Cop, Firewater), before moving to Washington, D.C. in 1985 where he formed the band Pussy Galore with Julia Cafritz, relocating to New York in May 1986. Spencer played and recorded with Gibson Bros., Boss Hog and The Honeymoon Killers prior to the formation of the Blues Explosion.

Judah Bauer, from Appleton, Wisconsin, had been in an early line-up of The Spitters, and with Russell Simins, from Queens, New York, recorded as part of Crowbar Massage.

It was with Jerry Teel&#x27;s Honeymoon Killers that Bauer, Simins and Spencer would all perform and record and from which they would go on to form The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

Russell and I would rehearse with Honeymoon Killers and the rehearsal would be over and Russell and I would keep playing, eventually inviting Simins&#x27; friend Bauer to join in. 

The sound of The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was informed by previous bands with influence taken from working with the Gibson Bros. which was already evident in the last Pussy Galore album. &quot;That final Pussy Galore album exuded a very Gibson Brothers-bent version of what was to come with Spencer&#x27;s next, more successful venture the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.&quot;

 &quot;...after five years of Pussy Galore I was able to connect to rock ’n’ roll in some way that I wasn&#x27;t able to before,&quot; he remembers those formative days. &quot;I was pissed off about a lot of things...so much shitty rock ’n’ roll that angered me, and Pussy Galore was kicking against that. With the Blues Explosion, there was some of that, but now I was into celebrating it.&quot; – Jon Spencer 

They were signed to the large independent label Matador Records between 1993 and 2002 in the US, Crypt Records between 1992 and 1994 in Germany and Mute Records between 1996 and 2005 in the UK although they have released material on a number of different labels including the 2010 reissues on Shout Factory in the US and Shove Records in the UK.

===First albums (1991–1992)===
The band had been playing together for six months when they had their first recording session with Kramer at Noise NY, New York in July 1991 and recorded fourteen songs over the course of three hours, &quot;only doing second takes here and there, we didn&#x27;t even go to the mixing board&quot;. This session was issued in its entirety as the first album by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, &quot;A Reverse Willie Horton&quot;. This was an unofficial album issued by &quot;Pubic Pop Can&quot;, at some point between late 1991 and early 1992, in an edition of 500 or 1000 copies (the figure varies between sources). It has been suggested that the source of the bootleg was a dubbed copy of a cassette that Jon Spencer let somebody copy during a tour with the Gibson Bros. in August 1991.

The front cover image on the album is a negative of Clarence Thomas, his wife, and George Bush at Thomas&#x27; swearing in ceremony for the Supreme Court on October 19, 1991, with the title and artist written in a typewriter style font. The rear sleeve features hand-written titles and label information over the top of a photograph of a topless woman. Both front and rear artwork are pasted onto a plain black sleeve. The title refers to the convicted felon William R. Horton who was used extensively for political advertisements during the 1988 presidential campaign.

The second session was recorded by Steve Albini at the Waterfront, Hoboken, New Jersey, in November/December 1991. Tracks from both the Kramer and Albini sessions were then officially issued on the Caroline (US) / Hut (UK) release &quot;The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion&quot;; in larger amounts by Crypt Records as &quot;Crypt Style&quot;; and in an alternate version of &quot;Crypt Style&quot; by 1 + 2 Records (Japan), including the track &quot;Colty&quot; which was unavailable elsewhere until the 2010 Shout! Factory release of &quot;Year One&quot; which compiled every released track from both sessions with the exception of an alternate take of &quot;Feeling of Love&quot; (released on &quot;Dirty Shirt Rock N Roll: The First Ten Years&quot;).

The band made a music video for the song &quot;Rachel&quot; directed by Jim Spring and Jens Jurgensen which was later issued by Matador Records on the 1997 &quot;Live Promo Video&quot;.

The first album by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was the only one to be issued by Caroline Records.

In 1992, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion inked a deal with Caroline Records and requested a very specific signing bonus-- the then-new 10xCD Jerry Lee Lewis box set. As band lore has it, Caroline never sprang for the set, and the Blues Explosion&#x27;s tenure there was short-lived and acrimonious.

The first single release was &quot;Shirt Jac&quot; on In The Red Records (1992) also from the second recording session with Steve Albini. This was the first of the &quot;Explosion Juke Box Series&quot; singles inspired by &quot;a similar series of Charlie Feathers released in the 70s&quot; (the third single in the series, &quot;Get With It&quot;, was actually an arrangement of a Feathers single from 1956).

The b-side &quot;Latch On&quot; is a Jon Spencer arrangement of a rockabilly song despite the fact that The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording has very little in common with the most well-known recordings of this track (released by Ron Hargrave and The Cochran Brothers). The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion version is more than likely a cover of the Cochran Brothers version of this song as both tracks feature the words &quot;you are really gone&quot; which do not appear in the lyrics sung by Ron Hargrave.

===&quot;Extra Width&quot; (1993–1994)===
When the band signed with Matador Records they &quot;asked for the 9xCD Stax-Volt Complete Singles 1959–1968...Matador made good with Stax, and the band enjoyed a decade-long partnership with the label&quot;.

In late 1992 Jon Spencer Blues Explosion embarked on a long tour in the US supporting the Jesus Lizard. Frank Kozik designed posters for shows at Emo&#x27;s, Austin, Texas and Kennel Club, San Francisco.

Recording sessions for the &quot;Extra Width&quot;, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion&#x27;s second studio album, took place in Memphis at Doug Easleys studio on November 23/24 and December 3, 1992 during the Jesus Lizard tour and at Waterworks Recording in New York with Jim Waters where all further overdubs and mixing was done. The album graphic design copies a package of panty hose purchased in Memphis, Tennessee. The original panty hose packaging can be seen in a band photo used on &quot;Mo&#x27; Width&quot; and the later reissues of &quot;Extra Width&quot;.

It is said that during this time Jon Spencer&#x27;s stage persona evolved and he established what is now synonymous with a Blues Explosion live performance.

&quot;Extra Width&quot; was released in June 1993. &quot;Afro&quot; was later released as a 7&quot; only single in the UK in 1994 and had a music video directed by Tom Surgal. This was the only single to be released from the album and featured b-side &quot;Relax-Her&quot; which is labelled as &quot;Incidental&quot; on the test pressing and introduced as such on the recording.

On September 11, 1993 The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion appeared at Blast First event The Lost Weekend at London Astoria 2 with The Afghan Whigs, God Machine and Hair &amp; Skin Trading Company. The accompanying Lost Weekend compilation album was limited to 3000 copies and included the song &quot;Afro&quot;. 2000 copies were given to attendees of the two-day event and the remaining 1000 were sold via (now defunct) UK music weekly &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for £1.50 each.

Their first TV appearance was on Channel 4 UK TV show &quot;The Word&quot; (Season 4, Episode 12) in February 1994, performing &quot;Afro&quot; and &quot;History of Sex&quot;. Afterwards presenter Mark Lamarr said &quot;they&#x27;re the best live band I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

Also in early 1994 In The Red Records released &quot;Train No. 3&quot; and &quot;Train No. 1&quot; as the third installment of the &quot;Explosion Juke Box Series&quot; (&quot;Train No. 2&quot; appeared &quot;Extra Width&quot;).

&quot;Mo&#x27; Width&quot; was issued in July 1994 by Au Go Go Records and made-up of out-takes from the &quot;Extra Width&quot;-era featuring covers of &quot;There Stands The Glass&quot; (Webb Pierce), &quot;Beat of The Traps&quot; (Teri Rodd &amp; MSR Singers) and &quot;Ole Man Trouble&quot; (Otis Redding), an alternate mix of &quot;Afro&quot; with a much more prominent organ solo and &quot;Rob K&quot; features Rob Kennedy from The Workdogs and the song was later titled &quot;Rob K is President&quot; on the Mute Records 2000 reissue.

During an interview with Dutch magazine &quot;Oor&quot;, Jon Spencer said that the release of &quot;Mo&#x27; Width&quot; was delayed until two months before the release as the next studio album.

===&quot;Orange&quot; (1994–1995)===
&quot;Orange&quot; was recorded at Waterworks, NYC with Jim Waters and released in October 1994. The original vinyl Matador Records was as a silver-coloured picture disc and first issue of the Crypt Records edition had orange-coloured sleeves rather than the usual silver.

&quot;Bellbottoms&quot; opens the album and features a string section arrangement by Kurt Hoffman. The song was also issued by Matador Records as a white vinyl 7&quot; only single in the UK and had a music video directed by Tom Surgal. There were also music videos for &quot;Dang&quot; directed by Steve Hanft, &quot;Flavor&quot;, directed by Evan Bernard and featuring appearances by Beck (who also appears on the song) and Mike D of the Beastie Boys.

In August 1994, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion played a number of tour dates in Australia and New Zealand with Beck. In September 1994, they played in the Netherlands at Vera, Groningen on the 18th and recorded a live set for VPRO radio on the 25th. The VPRO session was issued as an unofficial 10&quot; bootleg which included otherwise unreleased songs &quot;Curfew Blues&quot; and &quot;Wriggle and Move&quot; and the &quot;Intro&quot; is edited together in the same way as &quot;Tour Diary&quot; on &quot;Experimental Remixes&quot; and at least two segments appear on both releases. &quot;Curfew Blues&quot; was later released on &quot;Jukebox Explosion Rockin&#x27; Mid-90s Punkers&quot; and the 2010 reissue of &quot;Orange&quot; includes two VPRO session tracks &quot;Very Rare&quot; and &quot;Woman Love&quot; (title sometimes given as &quot;Frustrate&quot;).

In October 1994, the Blues Explosion made their first attempt to record a live album at DPC, Tucson, Arizona, but the performance was plagued with technical problems and was stopped when an audience member threw a stink bomb. Some of the songs were later released on the 2010 reissue of &quot;Controversial Negro&quot;. In December 1994, they performed live on The Jon Stewart TV Show at MTV Studios in New York City. &quot;Get With It&quot; from this show was released on the 1997 &quot;Live Promo Video&quot; by Matador Records.

The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion played UK shows in March 1995 with the Beastie Boys (including Brixton Academy, London where they would headline in April 2002 on the Plastic Fang tour) and in May they toured the US with The Roots and Beastie Boys.

&quot;Experimental Remixes&quot; EP was released in May 1995 featuring various tracks from &quot;Orange&quot; reworked by artists including UNKLE, Beck, Mario Caldato Jr., Mike D, Dub Narcotic Sound System, Moby and GZA (featuring Killah Priest). By September 1996, &quot;Orange&quot; had sold 70,000 copies.

In 2000, &quot;Experimental Remixes&quot; was reissued with new remixes on CD and double vinyl and &quot;Orange&quot; was reissued on CD with an enhanced section featuring &quot;Dang&quot;, &quot;Flavor&quot; and &quot;Bellbottoms&quot; music videos and on the vinyl edition was packaged with a poster. The album was reissued again in 2010 by Shout! Factory (US) / Shove Records (UK) as a double CD set this time combining &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Experimental Remixes&quot; and several rare, live and previously unreleased tracks.

===&quot;Now I Got Worry&quot; (1996–1997)===
On the afternoon of February 6, 1996, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recorded the album &quot;A Ass Pocket of Whiskey&quot; with R.L. Burnside and Kenny Brown at Lunati Farms in Holly Springs, Mississippi. A further two tracks, &quot;Alice Mae&quot; and &quot;Highway 7&quot;, also recorded at Lunati Farms in February 1996, would be released on the 1997 R.L. Burnside album &quot;Mr Wizard&quot;. Both albums featured cover artwork by Derek Hess.

The musical arrangements used on the tracks &quot;2 Brothers&quot; and &quot;Tojo Told Hitler&quot; from &quot;A Ass Pocket of Whiskey&quot; would evolve into The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion song &quot;Cool Vee&quot; which was released as a b-side to &quot;2Kindsa Love&quot;. &quot;Have You Ever Been Lonely?&quot; is a jam based on &quot;Vacuum of Loneliness&quot; originally released on the 1992 self-titled album.

&quot;It was pretty intimidating to go down [to Mississippi] and record with R.L. since he&#x27;s such an idol of mine,&quot; says Spencer, who toured with the guitarist/singer in 1995. &quot;You definitely get the feeling you&#x27;re playing for him, rather than with him. It was pretty much the same with Rufus Thomas.&quot;

&quot;Now I Got Worry&quot; was produced by Jon Spencer and Jim Waters and recorded at Easley Studio, Memphis; G-Son, Los Angeles; and Waterworks West, Tucson. These sessions were mostly between February 5 and 13, 1996 (the same time as the recording with R.L. Burnside). The album was released by Matador Records and Mute Records in October 1996 (reaching number 50 in the UK album chart) and features appearances by Thermos Malling of Doo Rag (credited with &quot;Bang&quot; on &quot;2Kindsa Love&quot;), Rufus Thomas and Money Mark and a cover version of &quot;Fuck Shit Up&quot; originally by Dub Narcotic Sound System with Judah Bauer on lead vocals. The Korean edition did not include &quot;Fuck Shit Up&quot; and the Japanese release featured &quot;Get With It&quot; and &quot;Cool Vee&quot; as bonus tracks.

During this time, Matador releases were distributed by Capitol in an article about this Marc Burton, buyer for Minneapolis’ Electric Fetus, said &quot;I think with the extra exposure he’ll get through wider distribution, Spencer could hit as big as Beck did.&quot;

Capitol / Matador released a promo-only 7” single of five different radio promo spots.

R.L. Burnside would also join The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for the &quot;Now I Got Worry&quot; tour dates in the UK, Europe and the US in October and November 1996. On October 23, 1996 Lola da Musica, VPRO TV filmed both artists in a pre-show jam session at De Melkweg, Amsterdam. &quot;Boogie Chillun&quot; was later released officially on the &quot;Live Promo Video&quot;.

On October 29, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recorded a short live set for MTV Studios in London, consisting of &quot;Now I Got Worry&quot; songs and &quot;Water Main&quot; and &quot;Vacuum of Loneliness&quot;. &quot;Love All of Me&quot; and the band introduction were officially released on the &quot;Live Promo Video&quot;.

&quot;2Kindsa Love&quot; was the first UK single released from &quot;Now I Got Worry&quot; by Mute Records issued on pink vinyl 7&quot; and CD in November 1996 with music video directed by Mike Mills it reached 122 in the UK charts.

&quot;Wail&quot; was released in the UK by Mute Records on May 10, 1997 as a CD and two 7&quot; singles (grey and green vinyl). The incorrectly spelled &quot;John Spencer Blues Explosion&quot; cover artwork was written in Tipp-Ex on an escalator hand-rail at Tottenham Court Road underground station in London (there was also a second part a bit further down the which just said &quot;Damn&quot;). Each of the covers features a slightly different photo by William Bankhead of the same text.

The music video for &quot;Wail&quot; was directed by Weird Al Yankovic, reaching number 66 in the UK singles chart.

In Melbourne, Australia, on September 6, 1997 The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion performed &quot;2Kindsa Love&quot; / &quot;Flavor&quot; on ABC&#x27;s national, weekly morning youth program, &quot;Recovery&quot;. Jon Spencer can be seen running through the audience, around the set and destroying the &quot;Blues Explosion&quot; back drop. Jon Spencer was asked about this particular performance in a June 2010 issue of the UK music weekly &quot;NME&quot;:
&quot;Which song were you playing with Jon Spencer Blues Explosion when you trashed a TV studio in Melbourne in &#x27;97?&quot;
&quot;We may have started with another song and went into &#x27;Flavour&#x27;. It wasn&#x27;t planned, it just kinda hit me. It may have just been exhaustion. You reach a point on tour and you get a bit punch-drunk. That show is broadcast live in the morning! They were all really nice about it though!&quot; 

In 2010, a new version of this album was released by Shout! Factory / Shove! Records expanded to include b-sides, rare tracks and the previously unreleased &quot;Roosevelt Hotel Blues&quot; featuring Beck and Money Mark.

In May 1997, &quot;Controversial Negro&quot; was released. This was a promotional only live album issued on vinyl in the US, CD in the UK and it was officially released in Japan on CD with five additional tracks. The title for this album comes from the Public Enemy song &quot;Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; from their 1990 album &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;. Towards the end of the track someone asks Flava Flav the following question: &quot;Now we&#x27;re considering you for a part in our new production, how do you feel about playing a controversial Negro?&quot;. The artwork used on the promotional version along with the title &quot;Controversial Negro&quot; was originally intended for &quot;Now I Got Worry&quot;.

In June 1997, they performed at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in New York City and a live version of &quot;Blues X Man&quot; was released on the accompanying triple CD album (which also featured Russell Simins performing with Cibo Matto).

===&quot;Acme&quot; (1997–1999)===
In March 1997 the band recorded a track at Dub Narcotic Studios, Olympia track for the K Records released the compilation &quot;Selector Dub Narcotic&quot; (released May 1998). The song titled &quot;Blues Explosion Attack&quot; name checked Calvin Johnson, Doo Rag, Subsonics, Speedball Baby, Demolition Doll Rods, R.L. Burnside, Dub Narcotic Sound System and Sleater Kinney who had supported the Blues Explosion at their Moore Theatre gig the previous day (The song would later be re-written and re-recorded for the album &quot;Acme&quot;).

Work on &quot;Acme&quot; began in October 1997, when the band entered the studio with Dan Nakamura, a.k.a. Dan the Automator for &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, a cover of the Dr. John hit used on the soundtrack to &quot;Scream 2&quot;.

Spencer said: &quot;The reason we did that Scream 2 soundtrack was to try working with a producer. We were definitely into the Dr. Octagon record – it&#x27;s a great record, and also a bizarre kinda record. So besides &#x27;Right Place.&#x27; we recorded some other songs.&quot;&quot;

The next stop was Steve Albini&#x27;s studio, Electrical Audio, where the Blues Explosion cut some tracks in the days following their 1998 New Year&#x27;s Eve Chicago performance. &quot;Steve&#x27;s we cut everything live, like we always do,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted to use Steve because I knew he would do a good job and the tapes would sound great, and we could send them to anybody because we had a great starting point and couldn&#x27;t really go wrong&quot;

Whilst in Chicago they also met Andre Williams who was playing locally. He recorded guest vocals for the track &quot;Lapdance&quot; (which wasn&#x27;t released until the &quot;Acme Plus&quot; / &quot;Extra Acme&quot; albums issued the following year).

The singer explained:
&quot;Acme&quot; was released in October 1998. In the US the first single to be released from the album was &quot;Talk About The Blues&quot;. This song was recorded during a session with Calvin Johnson at Dub Narcotic, Olympia, Washington. Most of the other tracks recorded at this time would be released in 1999 as the collaborative album &quot;Sideways Soul: Dub Narcotic Sound System Meets The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in a Dancehall Style!&quot;.

The music video, directed by Evan Bernard, features Winona Ryder, Giovanni Ribisi and John C. Reilly as the Blues Explosion with Judah, Russell and Jon acting. The singer told MTV Online: &quot;I think that people are really going to be surprised when they see the acting on the part of the Blues Explosion. When people get a load of some of the heavy, dramatic, really very intense scenes that we pulled out from our souls, I think people are really going to be blown away...&quot;.

Throughout the life of the band the use of the word &quot;blues&quot; in the band name has caused a great deal of debate. The lyrics of &quot;Talk About The Blues&quot; address this issue referring directly to MTV and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and features the line &quot;I do not play no blues, I play rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; (which itself was a reference to the Mississippi Fred McDowell album &quot;I Do Not Play No Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;).

&quot;Talk About The Blues&quot; was a reaction a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of &quot;Now I Got Worry&quot; and Q&amp;A with Jon Spencer.

I wrote the song right after we did the interview, inspired by that and also some of the criticism we’ve received over the past couple years. If we tried to record some song that was a response to criticism as it happened, that would be too heavy-handed. The lyrics stayed true to the original off-the-cuff feel, what you call a rant. But it&#x27;s not such a big deal, you know. A lot of that stuff just doesn&#x27;t merit a response. 

&quot;Magical Colors&quot; reached number 92 in the UK singles chart in November 1998. The Terry Richardson directed video is a compilation of still photographs.

&quot;Talk About The Blues&quot; reached number 120 in the UK singles chart in March 1999.

Non-&quot;Acme&quot; track &quot;New Year (Destroyer)&quot; was released as a split-single with Barry Adamson as the fourth single in the &quot;Slut Smalls&quot; series. &quot;Heavy&quot; was the final single to be released from &quot;Acme&quot; in August 1999: it reached number 106 in the UK singles chart.

In 1998, they appeared on the Canal+ show &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot; performing &quot;High Gear&quot; and &quot;Talk About The Blues&quot;. During the nine and a half minute performance Jon Spencer made full use of the television studio, running through the audience, standing on the desk and was carried back to the stage by one of the bemused presenters. Whilst on the desk Jon referred to and shook the hand of Jackie Chan who was given a copy of the album &quot;Acme&quot;.

On the morning of July 22, 1999, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion tour van was broken into in the loading dock of The Sheraton in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The window was smashed and a mess of gear was stolen, including mics, amps, rack equipment, and the original 1962 Vanguard Model Theremin. The theremin was never recovered.

===&quot;Sideways Soul&quot; (1999–2001)===
In September 1999 they released the collaborative album &quot;Sideways Soul&quot; under the name &quot;Dub Narcotic Sound System Meets The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in a Dancehall Style&quot;. The nine-track album was recorded at Dub Narcotic Studios, Olympia and featured a line-up of Jon Spencer on guitar, vocals and organ, Judah Bauer on guitar, Russell Simins on drums, Jeff Smith on organ and Calvin Johnson on vocals and melodica (&quot;Talk About The Blues&quot; was also recorded during these sessions).

The &quot;Acme&quot; outtakes and remixes were issued as &quot;Acme +&quot; (UK), &quot;Xtra Acme USA&quot; (US) and &quot;Extra Acme&quot; (CD) / &quot;Ura Acme&quot; (LP) / &quot;Extra Acme&quot; (Promo Only LP) (Japan), all of which had slightly different track listings. Like &quot;Acme&quot; the album features different production, mixing, remixing credits and guest appearances including Steve Albini, Nick Sansano, Jack Dangers, David Holmes, Tim Goldsworthy, Calvin Johnson, Moby, Andre Williams, Jill Cunniff, Cody Dickinson, Luther Dickinson and Jim Dickinson.

The Shout Factory! / Shove Records 2010 expanded reissue of &quot;Acme&quot; included a 22-track version of &quot;Acme Plus&quot; as the second disc. In February 2000, a 12&quot; single, &quot;Andre Williams Blues Explosion&quot;, featured remixes of the Andre Williams collaboration Lap Dance by Jim Waters/Scott Benzel and Jim Thirlwell.

===&quot;Plastic Fang&quot; (2002–2003)===
The album &quot;Plastic Fang&quot; was produced by Steve Jordan and recorded at Oorong, the Magic Shop and The Hit Factory. Released in April 2002, it featured art and design by Chip Kidd with the limited CD and vinyl editions being issued in a &#x27;Fang Pack&#x27;. The original artwork for this album was culled from comics.

Various editions of this album featured different track listings but there were guest appearances by Dr. John, Elliott Smith, Bernie Worrell, Willie Weeks and Bashiri Johnson.

&quot;She Said&quot; was the first single taken from the album, this had a music video directed by Floria Sigismondi. On February 8, the group filmed a second live performance video at the 100 Club on Oxford Street, London for &quot;She Said&quot; (directed by Barney Clay). This single would be, to date, their highest UK single chart entry at number 58. In April, they appeared on the BBC TV show Later with Jools Holland featuring Jools playing piano during &quot;Sweet n Sour&quot;.

The single &quot;Sweet N Sour&quot; came out in July with a video directed by Stylewar it reached number 66 in the UK singles chart. Another single &quot;Shakin&#x27; Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Tonight&quot; followed in November, reaching number 126.

On January 31, 2003 the band performed with Solomon Burke at Royal Festival Hall, London as &quot;Solomon Burke Meets Jon Spencer Blues Explosion&quot;.

===&quot;Damage&quot; (2004–2006)===
&quot;Damage&quot; was the only album to be released on Sanctuary Records and for this release the band were temporarily known as just the &quot;Blues Explosion&quot;. The shortened name lasted less than two years.

The album was recorded between December 2003 and April 2004 at Empire View Studios, New York City. Globe Studios, NYC and Elegant Too Studios with production and mixing credits including Dan The Automator, DJ Shadow, Steve Jordan, Free Association (David Holmes), Jay Braun, Alan Moulder, Danny Madorsky, Chris Maxwell and Phil Hernandez (Elegant Too) as well as the Blues Explosion, Jon Spencer and Russell Simins. During this time, the band also recorded the Guitar Wolf cover version &quot;Kawasaki ZII750 Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; at Empire View Recording Studio with Danny Madorsky for the tribute album &quot;I Love Guitar Wolf...Very Much&quot;. As a side note, the band Guitar Wolf once recorded an homage to the creator of the power chord, Mr. Link Wray.

&quot;Damage&quot; was released in September 2004 and features appearances from artists including Chuck D (&quot;Hot Gossip&quot;), Martina Topley-Bird (&quot;Spoiled&quot; / &quot;You Been My Baby&quot;), James Chance and DJ Shadow (&quot;Fed Up and Low Down&quot;) and Simon Chardiet, who would later perform with the Heavy Trash live band (&quot;Rattling&quot;). The single &quot;Burn It Off&quot; was issued with music video directed by Stylewar. It number 77 in the charts. In November, &quot;Hot Gossip&quot;, the second single reached 119 in the official UK charts and had a music video directed by David Raccuglia. Issued as a red vinyl 7&quot; only single featuring Elliott Smith on the B-side &quot;Meet Me in the City&quot; previously released on the tribute album &quot;Sunday Nights The Songs of Junior Kimbrough&quot;. &quot;Crunchy&quot; was the third and final single released in April 2005, reaching number 89 in the UK charts. The sleeves for all the &quot;Damage&quot;-era released featured photography by Ashkan Sahihi and design by Chip Kidd. In Japan, there were two slightly different promotional &quot;Radio Session&quot; CDs featuring live recordings of the album tracks &quot;Help These Blues&quot;, &quot;Spoiled&quot;, &quot;Rattling&quot;, &quot;Hot Gossip&quot; and a cover of the Suicide song &quot;Rocket USA&quot;, which is unavailable elsewhere.

In September 28/29, Russell Simins and Judah Bauer would join Tom Waits and Larry Taylor for a performance on the David Letterman TV show playing &quot;Make It Rain&quot; from the album &quot;Real Gone&quot;.

This particular event caused a furore behind the scenes when Mike Edison wrote a &quot;crazed conspiracy rant&quot; about Jon Spencer being replaced with Tom Waits for the Blues Explosion website. This was part of a bigger plan to get the a picture of Tom with Russell and Judah and send it out with a tongue-in-cheek press release (&quot;Tom Waits Blues Explosion&quot;) to see if the story would get picked up by the mainstream press but before the event took place a record company publicist took the text direct from the Blues Explosion website and sent it out as a legitimate press release and very nearly led to the show being called off.

Between August 2004 and May 2005, the band toured Europe/the UK, the US, Japan (eight dates with The Kills), Australia, the UK again (supporting The Hives) and Turkey. At this time in the UK, &#x27;garage rock&#x27; and bands such as The Hives, The Strokes, White Stripes were popular and it was often noted that The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion never got the recognition many writers felt they deserved.

It must rankle a little. Jon Spencer has been wrangling his brand of the blues – extrovert, down-and-dirty, pinched by punk and acknowledging a debt to Little Richard and Carl Perkins as much as Hasil Adkins and Son House – for around 14 years now. And have he and his band enjoyed even a taste of White Stripes-like acclaim? Have they flick

Of &quot;Crunchy&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; said it was &quot;packing the kind of irresistible groove that would shoot straight to the number one for 14 years in any right-thinking world.&quot;

A mock-up newspaper (front page only) titled &quot;The Daily Explosion&quot; and DVD featuring the music videos for &quot;Burn It Off&quot; and &quot;Hot Gossip&quot; was available at US gigs in November 2004.

In 2005 an EP &quot;Snack Cracker&quot; was released in Japan. This compiled many of the UK single B-sides album with &quot;Hot Gossip&quot; and &quot;Burn It Off&quot; videos, a Jay Braun remix of &quot;Hot Gossip&quot; and a live recording of &quot;Rattling&quot; featuring Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.

The Blues Explosion recorded the theme tune for Anthony Bourdain series &quot;No Reservations&quot; broadcast on The Travel Channel in 2005. The track lasts approximately 60 seconds; about 20 seconds of this is used during the programmes intro sequence and the menu screen on the subsequent DVD release.

On September 21, 2005, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion appeared at Ko Ko, London performing as part of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; shows organised by ATP where artists played albums in their entirety. The band played &quot;Orange&quot; followed by a set of non-&quot;Orange&quot; songs. During this time, there was a message sent out to the Blues Explosion mailing list outlining a number of future projects and releases including news of a &quot;Live Recordings&quot; album recorded during the &quot;Damage&quot; tour (possibly just the Japanese shows) which has, to date, never been released.

Towards the end of 2005, the band went on hiatus. The members worked on numerous different projects with different artists.

===Compilations and hiatus (2007–2011)===
In October 2008, they released a compilation of rare and unreleased tracks including all tracks from the five Explosion Jukebox Series singles (&quot;Shirt Jac&quot;, &quot;Son of Sam&quot;, &quot;Train No. 3&quot;, &quot;Get with It&quot; and &quot;Ghetto Mom&quot;). The album artwork parodied the original &quot;Back from the Grave&quot; 1983 compilation with drawings of Judah, Russell and Jon replacing the original characters. Both sleeves were created by Mort Todd. The band also started playing live again in June 2008 with a secret show at Bowery Electric followed by New York City Bicycle Film Festival and a short Jukebox Explosion European tour during August and September 2008.

In 2009, it was announced that The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion would release the 22 track retrospective compilation &quot;Dirty Shirt Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: The First Ten Years&quot; followed by expanded reissues of the previous albums &quot;Extra Width&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Acme&quot;, &quot;Now I Got Worry&quot;, &quot;Controversial Negro&quot; and tracks from the early releases (the original Kramer and Steve Albini recordings) &quot;Year One&quot;.

On April 16, 2010, they played a one-off show at Brooklyn Bowl and announced more shows taking place from July 2010 including Pitchfork Music Festival, Chicago, the Matador @ 21 Festival at The Pearl, Las Vegas and a number of US and Canadian shows.

The track &quot;Bellbottoms&quot; from the album &quot;Orange&quot; was featured at number 180 in a chart titled &quot;The Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s&quot; published by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; on August 30, 2010

In October, Yahoo! Music interviewed Jon Spencer, and the band performed acoustic versions of &quot;Burn It Off&quot;, &quot;Wail&quot; and &quot;Blues X Man&quot;. On October 15, 2010, videos of the songs and interview were published on the &quot;Maximum Performance&quot; blog along with a short article.

During 2010, the band started playing more regularly in Europe, US and Australia. They made their first UK appearance at London (Heaven) since the Don&#x27;t Look Back performance of &quot;Orange&quot; at Koko in September 2005.

During the live shows, the band played some previously unreleased songs including a cover of &quot;My War&quot; by Black Flag. And the band look set to continue playing live with further European live shows in mid-2011 including Primavera Festival in May.

Whilst touring in Australia, they recorded a cover version of &quot;Black Betty&quot; at Linear Recording for a commercial created by Volkswagen of America&#x27;s agency Deutsch L.A. Inc. broadcast during Super Bowl Sunday on American television (February 6, 2011).

===&quot;Meat + Bone&quot; (2012)===
The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England.

They released their new album &quot;Meat + Bone&quot; in September. It was very well received by the likes of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;The Quietus&quot;, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;.

===&quot;Freedom Tower&quot; and split (2015−2018)===
After extensive touring to promote &quot;Meat+Bone&quot;, the band returned to the studio in early 2015 to start work on their next album. The album, titled &quot;Freedom Tower - No Wave Dance Party 2015&quot; was released on March 24, 2015. The band toured in support of the record, playing their final show in Nuremberg on March 18, 2016.

On May 26, 2017 the film &quot;War Machine&quot;, starring Brad Pitt, was released on Netflix and their song &quot;Confused&quot; is played in an opening scene featuring Pitt walking through the airport. Its played again at the end of the film when Russell Crowe&#x27;s character is walking through the airport. Fittingly the lyric &quot;..C&#x27;mon Russell!..&quot; is sung during Crowe&#x27;s scene. The song is also heard in one of Netflix&#x27;s trailers for the film, Trailer #2 

In a 2018 interview, Spencer confirmed that the Blues Explosion had split permanently, offering as an explanation:

...everything got nipped in the bud when Judah [Bauer] got sick. He had developed a respiratory problem. He&#x27;s doing better now, but he can&#x27;t be going out on a rock and roll tour. Other things happened also. It wasn&#x27;t just Judah&#x27;s illness. For multiple reasons, it was, &#x27;OK, this is probably over, this is done.&#x27;

<doc id="576095" wikidata="Q1052799" url="?curid=576095" title="The Minstrel Boy">
<text>&quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; is an Irish song written by Irish poet Thomas Moore (1779–1852) and published as part of his &quot;Irish Melodies&quot;.
Moore himself came to be nicknamed &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot;, and indeed it is the title of Leonard Strong&#x27;s 1937 biography of Moore.

It is Roud Folk Song Index no. 13867.

== Publication, sources and popularity ==
The song was published in 1813 as part of Moore&#x27;s &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; project, which spanned the years 1808 to 1834.

The record of the melody to which the song is set, The Moreen, begins in 1813 with Moore&#x27;s publication of it, which is the sole source of the statement that it is a traditional Irish air.
There is no prior record, and no source for it has been firmly traced by the several scholars who have looked into the sources for Moore&#x27;s work.
Charles Villiers Stanford published a &quot;restored&quot; collection of Irish songs in 1895, asserting a source for the tune; but scholars Veronica Ní Chinnéide in the 20th century and Una Hunt in the 21st century think Stanford to have not properly researched things, with corrections to several of his attributions having followed in 1898 in Alfred Moffatt&#x27;s &quot;Minstrelsy of Ireland&quot;.
Moore, according to Hunt&#x27;s research, had greater access to manuscripts and to printed sources than previous researchers had believed.

Similarly according to Hunt&#x27;s research, Aloys Fleischmann mistakenly claimed as sources several works that in fact post-date Moore&#x27;s own publication.
The tune appears in George Thomson&#x27;s collection of Scottish and Irish airs in 1816, under Moore&#x27;s title, leading to the suspicion, albeit no documentary evidence for which has been found, that Thomson sent the tune to Moore.

The &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; were overall immensely popular in Ireland and Great Britain when they were published, reaching a diverse audience, and &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; was one of the most famous songs from that collection.
After his death, large numbers of special editions of what were later re-titled &quot;Moore&#x27;s Melodies&quot; were sold at premium prices, with lavish illustrations, expensive green leather bindings, and embossed images of shamrocks and golden harps.
These were also sold in North America, to which Moore&#x27;s popularity also extended.

==Theme and lyrics==
Like with several other of the &quot;Irish Melodies&quot;, &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; is melancholy and nostalgic.
Its central icon is the image of a harp, which is a romantic symbol for Ireland, torn asunder; but, in contrast to the Irish political songs of some of Moore&#x27;s contemporaries, with no promise of restoration implied for the future.
A &quot;warrior bard&quot; is forced into silence by slavery.

Some of Moore&#x27;s more subtle expressions of his politics in his songs were lost on early American audiences, who favoured the overt themes of freedom and liberty in &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot;, much in tune with the contemporary romantic notions of democracy that were also popular, and skipped over its references to slavery.
Moore himself, who had travelled through the United States and Canada the previous decade, had a low opinion of the slavery still (then) employed in the former, expressing in 1806 his disappointment and his casting aside all &quot;hope for the future energy and greatness of America&quot;.

Matthew Campbell, professor of Modern Literature and editor of &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Contemporary Irish Poetry&quot; (2003), contends that the images of harp, sword, and &quot;Land of song&quot; are &quot;over-egging a double cultural and political symbolism&quot; and that the &quot;histrionic&quot; song&#x27;s &quot;bathos&quot; contrasts with the &quot;delicacy&quot; of &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;.
In a contrasting view, George Bernard Shaw called the lyrics &quot;visionary&quot; in his preface to &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;.

The original lyrics are as follows:
 translated the whole of the &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; into Spanish and published them in 1863 in New York as the &quot;Melodías irlandesas de Tomás Moore&quot;.
His translations were informed by his own Cuban nationalism, and &quot;El trovador&quot; (the translation of &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot;) is equally as vehement in tone as Moore&#x27;s original, translating &quot;proud soul&quot; to &quot;espíritu patriota&quot; (patriotic spirit) and retaining references to &quot;esclavos&quot; (slaves), which was in fact a directly relevant political topic in Cuba, slavery not being abolished there until some two decades later.
The last four lines of de Mendive&#x27;s translation are, for comparison:
A concentrated, single verse version exists:
During the American Civil War a third verse was written by an unknown author, and is sometimes included in renditions of the song:
== Influences on other works and composers ==
=== Britten ===
Benjamin Britten referenced &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; in his opera &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; several times, starting with the principal characters Lechmere and Owen not using exactly the original melody, but a slightly distorted version of it, in scene 1.
In the analysis of music history professor J. Harper-Scott, Britten&#x27;s assumption would have been that the opera&#x27;s audience would either know the theme being referenced, or at least recognize its type.

Lechmere&#x27;s recital diverges from the original after the first arpeggio and progressively drops in pitch by semitones and tones at various points thereafter, ending a perfect fourth below where the original would have been.
Owen&#x27;s recital is even more divergent, and not only progressively drops in pitch from the original as well to a major third below, but even omits notes.
Lechemere uses the original words from Moore&#x27;s song, given in quotation marks in the score for the opera; but, in contrast, in the final scene of the first act, the character Sir Philip uses the tune and adheres more closely to the original than Owen does, but applies it instead to the final two words of &quot;for right and England&quot;.

The tune is also used, distorted, at various other points throughout the opera, including Lechemere&#x27;s conversation with Kate where he sings &quot;But Kate, does he reject you?&quot; to a less distorted version of the original melody.

=== Stanford and Sousa ===
Charles Villiers Stanford made overt political commentary on contemporary politics in Ireland in his music, including, amongst other places, the quotation of the first verse of &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; as preface to his score of his &quot;Fourth Irish Rhapsody&quot;.

John Philip Sousa, as director of the United States Marine Band, incorporated elements into the &quot;Mother Hubbard March&quot; (1885).

=== Joyce, Yeats, parodies, and burlesque ===
James Joyce parodied the song in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as &quot;The Leinstrel boy to the wall has gone&quot;.
In Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; the character Henry Flower being described as &quot;Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door, his wild harp slung behind him.&quot; is in part a direct quotation from the song, alluding to the character (Leopold Bloom under an alias) being like a minstrel who sings of lost loves.
Joyce referenced many of Moore&#x27;s works in his own work, but he also showed them a little disrespect, in which he was not alone; W. B. Yeats did so as well.

William Brough wrote a parody of the lyrics in his 1857 Victorian burlesque &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; (named for Moore&#x27;s &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot;): 

=== Mozart and Bizet ===
The tune bears a remarkable resemblance to the theme of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Flute Quartet K. 298 (written circa 1787), and to a lesser degree the Entr&#x27;acte to Act 3 from Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; (written in 1875). It is not certain whether the traditional tune influenced Mozart, nor is it certain whether either source may have inspired Bizet&#x27;s use in the Entr&#x27;acte.

==Notable performances and recordings==

Over the centuries since publication there have been numerous renditions of the &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; and of &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; in particular.
These include, in no particular order, popular recordings and performances by Irish tenor John McCormack, American actor/singer Paul Robeson, Irish folk singer Tom Clancy, Irish singer Shane MacGowan, and British singer Joe Strummer with his band The Mescaleros.
Strummer&#x27;s version was arranged by Hans Zimmer and used in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;.
The others are in various collections of &quot;Irish&quot;/&quot;Favourite&quot; songs by the respective performers.

Other performances of note have been:
* John Pope Hennessy during his time in Hong Kong had the 27th Inniskillings Regiment play &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; at formal occasions, including receptions at Government House.

<doc id="576098" wikidata="Q180552" url="?curid=576098" title="Mangalarga Marchador">
<text>The Mangalarga Marchador is a Brazilian breed of riding horse. It is the national horse breed of Brazil, where there are more than half a million of them; it is among the most numerous breeds of riding horse in the world. It derives from cross-breeding of Portuguese Alter Real horses with local Criollo stock. It displays four gaits: the walk, the canter, and two ambling gaits, the &quot;marcha batida&quot; and the &quot;marcha picada&quot;; it does not trot.

==History==

===Origin===
Francisco Gabriel Junqueira, Baron of Alfenas, began breeding his imported Lusitano to the mares on his farm (primarily Barbs, along with other breeds brought to Brazil when it was colonized). The result was a smooth-gaited, attractive horse which the baron called &quot;Sublime&quot;.

Junqueira sold some of the &quot;Sublimes&quot; to a friend who had a farm in Paty do Alferes, Rio de Janeiro. The farm&#x27;s name was &quot;Mangalarga&quot;, and the owner rode &quot;Sublimes&quot; to and from Rio de Janeiro. In Rio, people noticed the smooth-gaited, attractive Sublimes and began calling them Mangalargas. Breeders and researchers note that until at least 1910, most ranchers involved in the breed&#x27;s development (especially Junqueira Family members) followed the baron&#x27;s recommendations to fix the breed&#x27;s marching gait, hardiness, endurance, health and temperament.

===Breed split===
In 1934, the Mangalarga Breeders Association was created. Its founders wanted to establish a clear direction for breeding and define the breed&#x27;s function and desired characteristics (particularly the intended gait). They had largely achieved objectives dating back to 1812–1816, when a number of breeders moved from Minas Gerais (where the breed originated) to São Paulo. They had introduced bloodlines from several non-gaited horse breeds, including the (Arabian, Anglo-Arabian, Thoroughbred, Lusitano and the American Saddlebred. These crosses were intended to adapt the Mangalarga to the local topography, with a minimal loss of gait smoothness. This blood remains in only a few female lines of the Mangalarga Marchador.

Friction developed between those who wanted to maintain the breed&#x27;s original objectives and those defending the new type. The Mangalarga Breeders Association closed its stud book in 1943, nine years after its foundation. A group of breeders who disagreed with this decision met in 1948 and founded the &quot;Association Mangalarga Marchador&quot;, which became the &quot;ABCCMM&quot;. Although separate breed organizations exist for the Mangalarga and the Mangalarga Marchador and the breeds have different bloodlines and conformation, their roots are similar.

To unite differing factions and create a new stud book, the breeders turned to Geraldo Carneiro. Carneiro, a veterinarian and zoologist, was a friend and neighbor of the governor of Minas Gerais and future Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek and helped found a new breed association to preserve the original Marchador horse. The breeders met in Caxambu (where a Mangalarga Marchador museum is located); among those present were Joaquim Fernandes Braga (superintendent of the Minas Gerais Animal Production Department and Secretary of Agriculture, Industry, Trade and Labor) and personnel from the federal Ministry of Agriculture.

In 2017 the breed numbered close to 540,000 head in Brazil. About 350 are registered with a breed association in the United States.. The Brazilian breed association is the ABCCMM. In North America, the Mangalarga Marchador breed association is the [http://www.namarchador.org USMMA, a nucleo of the ABCCMM.

The Mangalarga Marchador breed exists internationally, with horses found in many countries. Europe and the United States have the most numbers outside of its native country, Brazil.
== Characteristics ==
The Mangalarga Marchador is a medium-sized breed with a silky coat, prominent withers, deep chest, a proportionately-long back, muscular hindquarters, a sloping croup and hard hoofs. Not all coat colours are accepted for registration - appaloosa for example is not. For stallions the ideal height is , with a range for registration from to . The ideal height for mares is , ranging from to .

Its head is triangular in shape with a straight profile, large nostrils, ears pointing slightly inwards and large, expressive eyes. Stallions have a slight crest on their neck.

===Gaits===

The breed is smooth-gaited, with two natural intermediate speed ambling gaits, called &quot;marcha&quot;; the &quot;marcha batida,&quot; where the feet move diagonally, in a manner similar to a fox trot, and the &quot;marcha picada,&quot; a four-beat lateral gait, similar to a stepping pace or singlefoot. The &quot;picada&quot;, which means &quot;light touch&quot; in Portuguese, is usually the smoother of the two, because the lateral movement creates little vertical momentum, and is similar to the &quot;paso llano&quot; of the Peruvian Paso. Conversely, &quot;batida&quot; means &quot;to hit&quot;, and that gait is similar to the &quot;trocha&quot; gait of the Paso Fino.

On level ground at a normal speed, the Mangalarga Marchador will overstep slightly; in other words, the hind hoofprints will cover (or slightly pass) the front hoofprints. The &quot;marcha&quot; is said by breed aficionados to be comfortable to ride. The Mangalarga Marchador does not trot or pace, moving from the &quot;marcha&quot; into a canter.

<doc id="576108" wikidata="Q35889" url="?curid=576108" title="Parametric equation">
<text>In mathematics, a parametric equation expresses several quantities, such as the coordinates of a point, as functions of one or several variables called parameters. 

In the case of a single parameter, parametric equations are commonly used to express the trajectory of a moving point, in which case, the parameter is often, but not necessarily, time, and the point describes a curve, called a parametric curve. In the case of two parameters, the point describes a surface, called a parametric surface. In all cases, the equations are collectively called a parametric representation, or parametric system, or parameterization (also spelled parametrization, parametrisation) of the object.

For example, the equations
formula_1
form a parametric representation of the unit circle, where is the parameter: A point is on the unit circle if and only if there is a value of such that these two equations generate that point. Sometimes the parametric equations for the individual scalar output variables are combined into a single parametric equation in vectors:

formula_2

Parametric representations are generally nonunique (see the &quot;Examples in two dimensions&quot; section below), so the same quantities may be expressed by a number of different parameterizations.

In addition to curves and surfaces, parametric equations can describe manifolds and algebraic varieties of higher dimension, with the number of parameters being equal to the dimension of the manifold or variety, and the number of equations being equal to the dimension of the space in which the manifold or variety is considered (for curves the dimension is &quot;one&quot; and &quot;one&quot; parameter is used, for surfaces dimension &quot;two&quot; and &quot;two&quot; parameters, etc.).

Parametric equations are commonly used in kinematics, where the trajectory of an object is represented by equations depending on time as the parameter. Because of this application, a single parameter is often labeled ; however, parameters can represent other physical quantities (such as geometric variables) or can be selected arbitrarily for convenience. Parameterizations are non-unique; more than one set of parametric equations can specify the same curve.

==Implicitization==
Converting a set of parametric equations to a single implicit equation involves eliminating the variable from the simultaneous equations formula_3 This process is called . If one of these equations can be solved for , the expression obtained can be substituted into the other equation to obtain an equation involving and only: Solving formula_4 to obtain formula_5 and using this in formula_6 gives the explicit equation formula_7 while more complicated cases will give an implicit equation of the form formula_8

If the parametrization is given by rational functions
formula_9

where , , and are set-wise coprime polynomials, a resultant computation allows one to implicitize. More precisely, the implicit equation is the resultant with respect to of and .

In higher dimensions (either more than two coordinates or more than one parameter), the implicitization of rational parametric equations may by done with Gröbner basis computation; see .

To take the example of the circle of radius , the parametric equations
formula_10

can be implicitized in terms of and by way of the Pythagorean trigonometric identity. With

formula_11
and
formula_12
we get 
formula_13
and thus
formula_14

which is the standard equation of a circle centered at the origin.

==Parametric plane curves==
===Parabola===

The simplest equation for a parabola,
formula_15

can be (trivially) parameterized by using a free parameter , and setting
formula_16

===Explicit equations===
More generally, any curve given by an explicit equation
formula_17

can be (trivially) parameterized by using a free parameter , and setting
formula_18

===Circle===

A more sophisticated example is the following. Consider the unit circle which is described by the ordinary (Cartesian) equation
formula_19

This equation can be parameterized as follows: 
formula_20

With the Cartesian equation it is easier to check whether a point lies on the circle or not. With the parametric version it is easier to obtain points on a plot.

In some contexts, parametric equations involving only rational functions (that is fractions of two polynomials) are preferred, if they exist. In the case of the circle, such a &quot;&quot; is 
formula_21

With this pair of parametric equations, the point is not represented by a real value of , but by the limit of and when tends to infinity.

===Ellipse===

An ellipse in canonical position (center at origin, major axis along the -axis) with semi-axes and can be represented parametrically as
formula_22

An ellipse in general position can be expressed as
formula_23

as the parameter varies from to . Here is the center of the ellipse, and is the angle between the -axis and the major axis of the ellipse.

Both parameterizations may be made rational by using the tangent half-angle formula and setting formula_24

=== Lissajous curve ===

A Lissajous curve is similar to an ellipse, but the and sinusoids are not in phase. In canonical position, a Lissajous curve is given by
formula_25
where and are constants describing the number of lobes of the figure.

===Hyperbola===
An east-west opening hyperbola can be represented parametrically by

formula_26

or, rationally

formula_27

A north-south opening hyperbola can be represented parametrically as

formula_28

or, rationally

formula_29

In all these formulae are the center coordinates of the hyperbola, is the length of the semi-major axis, and is the length of the semi-minor axis. Note that in the rational forms of these formulae, the points and , respectively, are not represented by a real value of , but are the limit of and as tends to infinity.

===Hypotrochoid===
A hypotrochoid is a curve traced by a point attached to a circle of radius rolling around the inside of a fixed circle of radius , where the point is at a distance from the center of the interior circle. 

The parametric equations for the hypotrochoids are:

formula_30

Some examples:
==Parametric space curves==

===Helix===
Parametric equations are convenient for describing curves in higher-dimensional spaces. For example:

formula_31

describes a three-dimensional curve, the helix, with a radius of and rising by units per turn. The equations are identical in the plane to those for a circle.
Such expressions as the one above are commonly written as

formula_32

where is a three-dimensional vector.

===Parametric surfaces===

A torus with major radius and minor radius may be defined parametrically as

formula_33

where the two parameters and both vary between and .

As varies from to the point on the surface moves about a short circle passing through the hole in the torus. As varies from to the point on the surface moves about a long circle around the hole in the torus.

===Straight line===
The parametric equation of the line through the point formula_34 and parallel to the vector formula_35 is

formula_36

==Applications==

===Kinematics===
In kinematics, objects&#x27; paths through space are commonly described as parametric curves, with each spatial coordinate depending explicitly on an independent parameter (usually time). Used in this way, the set of parametric equations for the object&#x27;s coordinates collectively constitute a vector-valued function for position. Such parametric curves can then be integrated and differentiated termwise. Thus, if a particle&#x27;s position is described parametrically as 
formula_37

then its velocity can be found as 
formula_38

and its acceleration as
formula_39

===Computer-aided design===
Another important use of parametric equations is in the field of computer-aided design (CAD). For example, consider the following three representations, all of which are commonly used to describe planar curves.

Each representation has advantages and drawbacks for CAD applications.

The explicit representation may be very complicated, or even may not exist. Moreover, it does not behave well under geometric transformations, and in particular under rotations. On the other hand, as a parametric equation and an implicit equation may easily be deduced from an explicit representation, when a simple explicit representation exists, it has the advantages of both other representations.

Implicit representations may make it difficult to generate points on the curve, and even to decide whether there are real points. On the other hand, they are well suited for deciding whether a given point is on a curve, or whether it is inside or outside of a closed curve.

Such decisions may be difficult with a parametric representation, but parametric representations are best suited for generating points on a curve, and for plotting it.

===Integer geometry===
Numerous problems in integer geometry can be solved using parametric equations. A classical such solution is Euclid&#x27;s parametrization of right triangles such that the lengths of their sides and their hypotenuse are coprime integers. As and are not both even (otherwise and would not be coprime), one may exchange them to have even, and the parameterization is then

formula_40

where the parameters and are positive coprime integers that are not both odd.

By multiplying and by an arbitrary positive integer, one gets a parametrization of all right triangles whose three sides have integer lengths.

== Underdetermined linear systems ==
A system of linear equations in unknowns is underdetermined if it has more than one solution. This occurs when the matrix of the system and its augmented matrix have the same rank and . In this case, one can select unknowns as parameters and represent all solutions as a parametric equation where all unknowns are expressed as linear combinations of the selected ones. That is, if the unknowns are formula_41 one can reorder them for expressing the solutions as

formula_42

Such a parametric equation is called a of the solution of the system.

The standard method for computing a parametric form of the solution is to use Gaussian elimination for computing a reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix. Then the unknowns that can be used as parameters are the ones that correspond to columns not containing any leading entry (that is the left most non zero entry in a row or the matrix), and the parametric form can be straightforwardly deduced.

<doc id="576114" wikidata="Q4466947" url="?curid=576114" title="Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.">
<text>Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret. is a middle-grade novel by American writer Judy Blume, published in 1970. Its protagonist, Margaret Simon, is a sixth-grader who grows up without a religious affiliation because of her parents&#x27; interfaith marriage. This contemporary realistic novel was popular with middle-grade readers in the 1970s for its relatable portrayal of a young girl confronting early-adolescent anxieties, such as menstruation, brassieres and boys. The recipient of national honors and book awards, the novel has been challenged for its frank discussion of sexual and religious topics.

The book was adapted into a 2023 film of the same name starring Abby Ryder Fortson, Rachel McAdams, and Kathy Bates.

==Background==
Blume said that she felt a connection with the character Margaret, which allowed the story to come &quot;pouring out.&quot; Blume wrote that while the story was not autobiographical, &quot;the character of Margaret, both physically and emotionally, is pretty close to the girl I was.&quot; Growing up, Blume said while her family was very different from the one portrayed in the book, she felt that, &quot;like Margaret, I had a very personal relationship with God that had little to do with organized religion.&quot;

Blume made a post-publication edit to subsequent editions of the book to reflect changing menstrual products.

==Plot==
When she is 11 years old, Margaret Simon&#x27;s family moves from New York City to the New Jersey suburbs. Her mother is Christian and her father is Jewish, but Margaret was raised without an affiliation to either faith. She frequently prays to God, beginning her prayers with, &quot;Are you there God? It&#x27;s me, Margaret.&quot;

Margaret feels uncomfortable with her lack of religious affiliation. For a school assignment, she studies religious beliefs, hoping to resolve her faith-based issues. Her study includes attending different places of worship to learn about religious practices. Her Jewish grandmother, Sylvia Simon, takes Margaret to Rosh Hashanah services and hopes her granddaughter will embrace Judaism.

Margaret befriends Nancy, a neighbor who is the same age. Nancy seems confident and knowledgeable about many subjects, including sex. Nancy, Margaret, and their friends Gretchen and Janie form a secret club called the Pre-Teen Sensations. The Pre-Teen Sensations discuss boys, brassieres and menstruation. The girls anxiously await their first period, preparing by buying belted sanitary napkins. They also perform exercises to increase their bust sizes while chanting: &quot;We must, we must, we must increase our bust!&quot;

Gretchen has her first menstrual period, which causes Margaret to worry that she is abnormal because she has not started menstruating. Margaret envies her classmate, Laura Danker, who started menstruating and wears a brassiere. According to Nancy, Laura dates an older boy. The Pre-Teen Sensations gossip about Laura letting boys touch her breasts. Margaret feels guilty when she learns that Laura is a devout Catholic and is hurt by the rumors. Margaret is attracted to a popular boy in her class named Philip Leroy. They kiss while playing &quot;two minutes in the closet&quot; during a party. Nancy lies to the Pre-Teen Sensations that she had her first menstrual period when away on vacation. Margaret discovers the truth when they are at a restaurant, and Nancy gets her actual first menstrual period.

Margaret&#x27;s family plans to spend the spring vacation with Sylvia in Florida. The day before the family&#x27;s vacation, Margaret&#x27;s conservative Christian grandparents, Mary and Paul Hutchins, visit. Because they disapprove of their daughter&#x27;s interfaith marriage, Mary and Paul have been estranged from Margaret&#x27;s mother for fourteen years. Margaret&#x27;s mother cancels the Florida vacation, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s not the end of the world&quot; and that they can always go to Florida another time. Margaret is upset but tries to be polite to her grandparents. When her grandparents mention religion, a heated argument ensues, during which Margaret angrily declares that she does not need religion or God.

Margaret then stops talking to God. By the end of her school project, she still has not resolved her religious identity. However, she has learned about herself and has become more comfortable with her lack of affiliation. On the last day of school, Margaret gets her first menstrual period. Relieved, she resumes her relationship with God, saying, &quot;I know you&#x27;re there God. I know you wouldn&#x27;t have missed this for anything! Thank you, God. Thanks an awful lot...&quot;

Scholastic selected the novel for its &quot;100 Greatest Books for Kids/100 Must-Read Books&quot;.

==Censorship in the United States==
Beginning in the 1970s, &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot; has been frequently challenged because of its frank talk about menstruation and its depiction of a child being allowed to decide for herself what religion she would prefer to adhere to. The American Library Association&#x27;s (ALA) list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of the 1990s ranked the book at number sixty. The novel ranked 99 on ALA&#x27;s list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of the 2000s. The book dropped from the ALA list for 2010 through 2020.

==Subsequent book==
Blume&#x27;s success with &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot; inspired her to write &quot;Then Again, Maybe I Won&#x27;t&quot;, a novel focused on similar themes from a boy&#x27;s perspective. The narrator of &quot;Then Again, Maybe I Won&#x27;t&quot; is Tony Miglione, a twelve-year-old boy who is also dealing with puberty.

==Popular culture==
The book has been referenced in a number of media including Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel &quot;Damned&quot;, television shows such as &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;,&quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; television show and the television series &quot;Lost&quot;.

The book is also referenced in the film &quot;Deadpool&quot;, &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;, Chelsea Handler&#x27;s book, &quot;Are You There, Vodka? It&#x27;s Me, Chelsea&quot;, in 2008., and Ellen Coyne&#x27;s &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Ellen&quot;, in 2020.

Other television references have included &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers.&quot;

&quot;Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants&quot;, by Dav Pilkey, references the book in a chapter title, after George and Harold&#x27;s names are legally changed to Fluffy Toiletnose and Cheeseball Wafflefanny: &quot;Are You There, God? It&#x27;s Us, Fluffy and Cheeseball.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

In October 2018, a film adaptation of the book was in the early stages of development by James L. Brooks and Kelly Fremon Craig. In 2020, Lionsgate won the rights to adapt the film at auction, allocating it a budget of $30 million. In April 2021, Lionsgate started filming in Charlotte, North Carolina. Production concluded on July 1, 2021. Judy Blume was one of the film&#x27;s producers, and she claims it is better than the book. The film was released on April 28, 2023, to widespread critical acclaim.

<text>The Koppelpoort is a medieval gate in the Dutch city of Amersfoort, province of Utrecht. Completed around 1425, it combines land and water-gates, and is part of the second city wall of Amersfoort, which was constructed between 1380 and 1450.

==History==
The gate was built between 1380 and 1425 as part of the second city wall. The whole wall was completed around 1450. The gate was attacked in 1427 during the siege of the city. This attack was repelled.

The gate was opened and closed every day by the appointed &quot;raddraaiers&quot;, &quot;wheel-turners&quot;. A minimum of twelve wheel-turners were collected morning and evening by several guards. It was an extremely dangerous task; if they did not begin walking simultaneously, then one could fall, dragging the rest along with often fatal results. Before the gate could come down, it had to be raised, to pull out the iron pins that held it in place. Only then could it come down. While the gate was going down, walking in the wheel grew ever easier and faster, and many people stumbled and broke their limbs. The Koppelpoort was also never breached.

The Koppelpoort was given its current appearance during the restoration by Pierre Cuypers in 1885 and 1886. Among other things, Cuypers removed a step between the two gates and replaced it with a slope.

From 1969 to 1993 a puppet theater was situated in the gate.

The latest restoration was completed in 1996. It was carried out very cautiously, and with respect for the old building materials. For this the town of Amersfoort received the Europa Nostra Award.

<text>The International Balzan Prize Foundation awards four annual monetary prizes to people or organizations who have made outstanding achievements in the fields of humanities, natural sciences, culture, as well as for endeavours for peace and the brotherhood of man.

==History==
The assets behind the foundation were established by the Italian Eugenio Balzan (1874–1953), a part-owner of who had invested his assets in Switzerland and in 1933 had left Italy in protest against fascism. He left a substantial inheritance to his daughter Angela Lina Balzan (1892–1956), who at the time was suffering an incurable disease. Before her death, she left instructions for the foundation and since then it has two headquarters, the Prize administered from Milan, the Fund from Zurich.

The first award was in fact one million Swiss francs to the Nobel Foundation in 1961. After 1962, a gap of 16 years followed when prizes recommenced with an award of half a million Swiss francs to Mother Teresa. Award ceremonies alternate between Bern and the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, and frequently winners have later won a Nobel Prize.

==Procedure==
All awards are decided by a single committee. The Balzan Prize committee comprises twenty members of the prestigious learned societies of Europe.

Each year the foundation chooses the fields eligible for the next year&#x27;s prizes, and determines the prize amount. These are generally announced in May, with the winners announced the September the following year.

==Rewards and assets==
Since 2001 the prize money has increased to 1 million Swiss Francs per prize, on condition that half the money is used for projects involving young researchers.

As of 2017, the amount of each of the four Balzan Prizes is now 750,000 Swiss francs (approx. €760,000; $750,000; £660,000).

==Categories==

Four prizes have been awarded annually since 1978. The award fields vary each year and can be related to either a specific or an interdisciplinary field. The prizes go beyond the traditional subjects both in the humanities (literature, the moral sciences and the arts) and in the sciences (medicine and the physical, mathematical and natural sciences), with an emphasis on innovative research.

In different fields the prize is considered a significant prize, for example in sociology.

Every 3 to 7 years the foundation also awards the &quot;Prize for humanity, peace and brotherhood among peoples&quot;. It was last awarded in 2014 to Vivre en Famille.

<doc id="576122" wikidata="Q333685" url="?curid=576122" title="David Renton">
<text>David Lockhart-Mure Renton, Baron Renton, (12 August 1908 – 24 May 2007) was a British politician who served for over 60 years in Parliament, 34 in the House of Commons and then 28 in the House of Lords.

Renton was Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire from 1945 to 1979, initially as a Liberal National and then in accordance with the party&#x27;s successive mergers with the Conservatives, as a &quot;National Liberal and Conservative&quot;, then in 1968 he was one of the final three National Liberal MPs who opted to wind up the party and become a full part of the Conservatives. He became a life peer in 1979, and was the oldest member of the House of Lords from 2004 until his death.

==Early life==
Renton was born in Dartford, the son of a surgeon and a nurse. He was educated at Stubbington, Oundle, and University College, Oxford, of which he was made an honorary fellow in 1990. Going up to read medicine, he switched to law. He was president of the Oxford University Liberal Club. He played Rugby fives for the University of Oxford and also played cricket and rugby union for his college. He then entered the Inns of Court to study law.

==Early career==
Renton was called to the bar from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1933. He practised as a barrister on the South-east Circuit, with a mixed caseload of civil and criminal law. He was elected as a member of the General Council of the Bar in 1939, and was Treasurer of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1979, the year he retired from the House of Commons.

Renton joined the Territorial Army in 1938 and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers. He transferred to the Royal Artillery in 1940, and volunteered to serve overseas in 1942. He was posted to the Middle East for three years. Promoted to Major, he served as a legal adviser at GHQ Cairo, before becoming president of the British Military Court of Tripolitania, based in Tripoli, in 1944.

==Career==
He returned to England in 1945, and was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdonshire in the 1945 general election, as a Liberal National. During his time in the Commons the party merged with the Conservatives at constituency level (and changed their name to &quot;National Liberal&quot;, with Renton using the label &quot;National Liberal and Conservative&quot; in elections from 1950 onwards). In 1968 he was one of the final three National Liberal MPs who opted to wind up the party and become a full part of the Conservatives. He continued to practise law throughout his political career, and became a QC in 1954. He befriended Margaret Roberts (later Thatcher) when she was a student at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1950. He became a bencher in 1962, and served as Treasurer in 1979. He was Recorder of Rochester from 1963 to 1968 and Recorder of Guildford from 1968 to 1973. He was vice-chairman of the Council of Legal Education from 1968 to 1973, and served as a member of the Senate of Inns of Court.

Renton joined the British delegation to draft the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950. He became a junior minister in the governments of Sir Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan in the 1950s, serving as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Fuel and Power under Aubrey Jones from 1955 to 1957, and then at the Minister of Power from 1957 to 1958, where he assisted to pass the Clean Air Act. He moved to the Home Office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State from 1958 to 1961 and then as Minister of State from 1961 to 1962. Serving under Home Secretary Rab Butler, he pushed through acts including the Life Peerages Act 1958, the Street Offences Act 1958 and the Commonwealth Immigration Act 1962. He was sacked in the Night of the Long Knives in July 1962, but received the consolation of being sworn of the Privy Council. He later sat on a number of House of Commons committees. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1964, and won an RSPCA bronze medal the same year for rescuing horses and pigs from a fire hear his home.

He supported Britain joining the European Community, but later supported the Save the Pound campaign. In 1971, he was a member of the &quot;Kilbrandon Commission&quot;, the Royal Commission on the Constitution which rejected complete self-government for Scotland and Wales, suggesting instead a limited form of devolution. At the invitation of Ted Heath, he chaired the Committee on Preparation of Legislation which reviewed the methods for drafting Acts of Parliament. The Renton Report was published in 1975, recommending drafting which was more based on principles than specific details to address every possible situation.

He served as Deputy Lieutenant for Huntingdonshire in 1962, for Huntingdon and Peterborough in 1964, and for Cambridgeshire in 1974.

He stood down from his Huntingdonshire seat at the 1979 general election, and was created a life peer on 11 July 1979, taking his seat in the House of Lords as Baron Renton, &quot;of Huntingdon in the County of Cambridgeshire&quot;. His successor as MP for Huntingdonshire was the future Conservative Prime Minister John Major. He was a deputy speaker in the House of Lords from 1982 to 1988.

===Later career===
He was elected president of the Association of Conservative Peers in 1998, unopposed, and became life president in 2003. Renton was the oldest peer in the House of Lords from 4 April 2004 until his death.

He played cricket for the Lords and Commons Cricket Club until he was 66, and hunted until he was 70. He continued to shoot until he was 91, when a heart valve was replaced.

He was a leader in the movement to preserve the traditions of the House of Lords, including lifelong membership for members of the Peerage. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2005, Renton maintained that &quot;the genius of the upper house is that it includes world-renowned experts in law, science and the arts who would never run for election&quot;, and that &quot;Democracy has its limitations.&quot; His memoirs, &quot;The Spice of Life&quot;, were published in 2006.

==Personal life==
In July 2003, just short of his 95th birthday, he passed his driving test for the first time. He was a regular driver since 1934, at a time when there was no formal driving test in the United Kingdom, although he stopped driving some time before he died. In passing his driving test, he became the oldest person to pass the driving test in the United Kingdom.

He married in 1947 Claire Cicely &quot;Paddy&quot; Duncan, a sister of Marjorie Grimston, Countess of Verulam. They had three daughters. His wife died of cancer in 1986. His youngest daughter, Davina, inherited Rett syndrome which left her severely mentally and physically disabled. She died in October 2006. He was chairman of Mencap from 1978, and president from 1982 to 1988. He and his wife established the charity Demand (Design and Manufacture for Disability) to provide adapted furniture to the disabled.

===Death===
He died in Abbots Ripton in Cambridgeshire. He was survived by two daughters, Caroline and Clare.

<doc id="576135" wikidata="Q3313316" url="?curid=576135" title="Mike Garcia (baseball, born 1923)">
<text>Edward Miguel &quot;Mike&quot; Garcia (November 17, 1923 – January 13, 1986), nicknamed &quot;Big Bear&quot; and &quot;Mexican Mike&quot;, was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). Garcia was born in San Gabriel, California, and grew up in Orosi, Tulare County.

Garcia entered minor league baseball at the age of 18. After one season, he joined the U.S. Army and served for three years. Following his honorable discharge, he returned to baseball. He was promoted to MLB in 1948. He played 12 of his 14 major league seasons for the Cleveland Indians.

From 1949 to 1954, Garcia joined Bob Lemon, Early Wynn, and Bob Feller on the Indians&#x27; &quot;Big Four&quot; pitching staff. Historians consider the &quot;Big Four&quot; to be one of the greatest starting pitching rotations in baseball history. During those six seasons with the &quot;Big Four&quot;, Garcia compiled a record of 104 wins against 57 losses. He had two 20-win seasons and led the American League (AL) in earned run average (ERA) and shutouts twice each.

Garcia&#x27;s best season came in 1954 when the Indians won a league record 111 games. Baseball historian Stephen Lombardi said that Garcia may have been the best AL pitcher that year. Garcia remained with the Indians until 1959, but never duplicated the success he had achieved in 1954. In his last five seasons with Cleveland, he finished with losing records three times. After leaving the Indians, Garcia spent a season with the Chicago White Sox and a season with the Washington Senators.

Garcia retired from baseball in 1961. He developed diabetes within a few years and suffered from kidney disease and heart problems until his death. Garcia died outside Cleveland at the age of 62 and was buried in his home state of California. He was the only member of the &quot;Big Four&quot; not elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, but he has been included on a list of the 100 Greatest Indians and has been inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame. Baseball experts and former teammates have commented on Garcia&#x27;s overpowering pitching, his fine control and his low ERA.

==Early life==
Garcia was born in San Gabriel, California, and was of both Indigenous Gabrieleño and Mexican heritage. He grew up on a ranch in Orosi, California, where his father, Merced Garcia, moved the family when Mike was 2. Mike&#x27;s family had close ties to that of Atlanta Braves infielder Marty Perez, and the two referred to each other as cousins.

Mike&#x27;s father raised horses, and Mike aspired to race them. He participated in one race and was thrown from the horse. Garcia played four years of high school baseball, the first three years at Orosi High School and the last at Visalia High School.

Garcia was pitching in semipro baseball when Cleveland Indians scout Willis Butler noticed him in Tulare, California. In 1942, Butler signed him as an amateur free agent to the organization&#x27;s Class D farm team, the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League. Garcia earned a 10–10 win–loss record with Appleton. He spent the next three years as a signalman in the United States Army during World War II, serving in Europe as a member of the Signal Corps.

Garcia was discharged from the Army at the age of 22 and returned to the Cleveland organization. He played for the Class C Bakersfield Indians of the California League. With Bakersfield, Garcia&#x27;s ERA and strikeouts led the league and he earned 22 wins. In 1947 he joined the Cleveland Indians during spring training, but he was assigned to the Class A Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League by Cleveland coach Bill McKechnie. He finished the season with 17 wins and a 3.24 ERA. In 1948, he pitched for the Double-A Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League and earned 19 wins.

==Major league career==

===Early career===
Garcia debuted with the Indians on October 8, 1948, just before the Indians played in the 1948 World Series. He allowed three hits and no runs in two innings, and he struck out one batter. The Indians won the World Series in six games. It was the franchise&#x27;s second World Series victory, but Garcia did not make a World Series appearance.

Nicknamed &quot;The Big Bear&quot; by teammate Joe Gordon for his large frame, Garcia was listed at , 200 lb (91 kg) during his career. Garcia said that his actual playing weight was between 215 and 220 lb (97–100 kg). Garcia also acquired the nickname &quot;Mexican Mike&quot; in the press. However, Garcia&#x27;s minority status was not a novelty. The Indians had signed Larry Doby, the first black player in the American League, in 1947. The 1951 team added manager Al López and Latino players Minnie Miñoso and Jesse Flores to a squad that already included Garcia and Mexican player Bobby Ávila. Early on, Garcia was paired to room with Avila, who had just signed with the team and did not speak English. Garcia served as a translator for Avila well beyond their first season together.

Garcia returned to the Indians in 1949. A newspaper article predicted that Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen. Garcia saw action as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year, starting 20 of his 41 regular season appearances. He finished his rookie season with a 14–5 record, a league-leading 2.36 ERA, 94 strikeouts and five shutouts. Fellow pitcher Bob Feller said, &quot;From the beginning, Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher. For a big guy, he was certainly mobile.&quot; One year removed from his rookie season, expectations from Indians general manager Hank Greenberg and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of the Indians&#x27; rotation. &quot;Garcia has all the potentialities of a really great pitcher. I see no reason he should not reach greatness this season&quot;, Greenberg said. Garcia finished the 1950 season 11–11.

By the 1951 season, media sources had given the nickname &quot;Big Four&quot; to the pitching combination of Garcia, Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Early Wynn. Garcia had learned to control the curveball that Harder taught him in spring training of 1949. Harder said that Garcia already had a terrific fastball, but that he became a good pitcher by learning the curveball and working on his control. Cleveland sportswriter Hal Lebovitz wrote, &quot;Garcia, until the day he died, would tell me how much of the success he owed to Harder.&quot; Garcia also once admitted to throwing an occasional spitball, an illegal pitch. &quot;Maybe a dozen in my life. I&#x27;m sure plenty of the great pitchers did&quot;, he said.

Garcia pitched a 10-hit complete game on June 4, 1951, in an 8–2 Cleveland win, helping the Indians beat New York Yankees pitcher Ed Lopat for the first time in two years. Before the game, Lopat&#x27;s record was 8–0 on the season. Garcia improved his season mark to 5–3. On August 7 against the St. Louis Browns, Garcia reached a career-high 15 wins. In a 5–1 victory, he also recorded his second career home run. Garcia won 20 games in 1951 and finished fifth in the AL with six saves.

===All-Star seasons===
In 1952, Garcia made his first of three consecutive All-Star teams. As the Indians battled for the 1952 American League pennant heading into September, he began the month with three consecutive shutouts during an eight-game Indian win streak. The Indians faced Ed Lopat and the Yankees again on September 14 in what Associated Press columnist Jack Hand labeled &quot;one BIG game.&quot; In a 7–1 loss, Garcia gave up four earned runs on five hits in three innings. He finished the 1952 season with a 22–11 record, 143 strikeouts, an AL-best six shutouts and four saves. He was second in the league in ERA (2.37), games (46) and innings pitched (292.1, behind Lemon). Only Wynn had more wins (23) among right-handers; Garcia and Lemon had 22 each, and the pair tied for the league lead with 36 starts. Garcia finished ninth in the 1952 MVP voting.

In 1953, Garcia and Lemon were named pitchers on the AL All-Star squad. Doby and Al Rosen were also on the team, with Rosen selected as the game&#x27;s MVP. Garcia finished the season 18–9; he pitched a career-high 29 complete games with 134 strikeouts and a 3.25 ERA. Like the previous season, Lemon and Garcia finished first and second in the American League in innings pitched. Garcia was labeled &quot;one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in the game&quot; by &quot;The Cleveland Press Guide&quot;. As Feller&#x27;s dominance faded in the latter part of his career, Garcia, Lemon, and Wynn were increasingly referred to as the &quot;Big Three&quot;.

On May 16, 1954, Garcia pitched a one-hitter against the Philadelphia Athletics in a 6–0 Indians win. Garcia called it the finest game of his career. He was selected for his third and final All-Star Game when American League manager Casey Stengel added him, Lemon, and Doby to an American League roster that already featured Avila and top vote-getter Al Rosen. During a late July exhibition game, Garcia learned that his father had died at the age of 65; Garcia&#x27;s son Michael was born the same day. He missed several games that year with a broken blood vessel in his throwing hand, but he managed 45 appearances on the season.

Entering the final regular season game in 1954, Garcia had 19 wins; he would have received a bonus if he collected 20 wins. After pitching 12 innings, he left with the score tied at 6–6. The Tigers won after 13 innings, 8–7. Earning a no-decision, Garcia failed to reach the 20-win mark. However, Greenberg had assured Garcia he would receive a bonus whether he won 20 games or not. Garcia pitched six innings or more in six out of his seven August appearances. He earned wins in three out of his last four appearances, and pitched seven innings or more in all four appearances. The team finished 111–43. The win total broke a 154-game season record, and the team had the lowest team ERA (2.78) in the AL since the dead-ball era season of 1919. Garcia was 19–8 with 129 strikeouts, again leading the AL in both ERA (2.64) and shutouts (5).

In the 1954 World Series, the heavily favored Indians were defeated by the New York Giants. Garcia started game three, but was replaced by a pinch hitter in the bottom of the third inning, already trailing 4–0. Author Jonathan Knight described the progression of the game: &quot;...a throwing error by George Strickland, and Mike Garcia had struggled in the opening frame, allowing three baserunners, as panic began to creep into Municipal Stadium. For the first time all year, it was warranted.&quot; The Giants won the game, 6–2, and won game four to claim the Series.

===Final years with Indians===
From 1955 to 1959, Garcia finished with losing records in three of five seasons. The 1955 season represented Garcia&#x27;s first losing record (11–13) and his first season ERA over 4.00. The 1954 ERA leader finished 1955 with a 4.02 ERA. The Indians finished in second place in the AL at 93–61, three games behind the Yankees. Garcia repeated a losing mark on the 1956 season (11–12), the only time in his career he finished with consecutive losing seasons. He and Wynn were among those who tied for second place in shutouts on the season (4) behind fellow Indian Herb Score. Cleveland finished 88–66 and nine games behind first place, which went to the Yankees again. Lopez was replaced as manager by Kerby Farrell. In spring training before the 1957 season, Farrell observed that the league&#x27;s best pitching staff could not carry the team alone. Garcia ended the season 12–8 with a 3.75 ERA, but the Indians finished sixth in the American League. Their 76–77 finish was the club&#x27;s first losing record since 1946.

Bobby Bragan replaced Farrell as manager to begin the 1958 season. During a spring training game in March, Garcia slipped on a wet pitcher&#x27;s mound and injured his back. He did not make his first regular season appearance until April 27 and he underwent surgery in June for a herniated disc. He finished the season with a 1–0 record in six appearances and eight innings of work. That same month, Bragan was fired as manager. He was replaced by former Indians player Joe Gordon, and the Indians finished 77–76.

Garcia elected to become a free agent in the offseason, but he returned to the Indians, saying that his home and his dry cleaning business were in Cleveland. &quot;Everything being equal, I&#x27;ll sign with the Indians if I decide I&#x27;m able to pitch... This is a friendly city and I like it&quot;, he said. During a spring training game in March 1959, Garcia was hit in the knee by a Billy Consolo line drive and was carried off the field on a stretcher and taken to a Tucson hospital. He did not make his first season start until May 3, when he allowed four hits and no earned runs in a complete game loss. He finished with a 3–6 record, a 4.00 ERA and 72 innings pitched in his twelfth and final season with the Indians.

===Chicago White Sox and Washington Senators (1960–61)===
Garcia signed with the Chicago White Sox for the 1960 season, reuniting with manager Al López and former Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck. Veeck said, &quot;Our reports on Mike were real good. He might help us in 1960.&quot; He appeared in 15 games and pitched 17.2 innings with 4.58 ERA and 0–0 record. In July 1961, the expansion Washington Senators signed the 37-year-old Garcia to a contract. The Senators placed him on waivers before the end of the season. He finished with a 0–1 record, pitched 19 innings in 16 games and earned a 4.74 ERA. Garcia finished his major league career with a 142–97 record, 1,117 strikeouts, a 3.27 ERA, 27 shutouts and 23 saves in 428 games (281 starts) and 2,174.6 innings.

==Beyond baseball==
Garcia married Gerda Martin on January 13, 1951; they had three children. He served as a sponsor for Camel cigarettes during his playing days. Garcia raced midget cars during and after his baseball career. Garcia injured the index finger of his throwing hand while working on a midget car in late 1959, but the wound was repaired without lasting effects.

==Illness and death==
Garcia developed diabetes in his forties. As a result, he suffered from kidney disease and heart damage in the last years of his life. Faced with dialysis three times per week, Garcia joined his former teammates at fundraising events to defray his medical expenses. He died in Fairview Park, Ohio on January 13, 1986, at the age of 62. He died on his 35th wedding anniversary. He was buried in his hometown of Visalia, California. Garcia, whose annual salary was never greater than $35,000, died with more than $100,000 in outstanding medical bills.

==Legacy==
Garcia was not selected a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His normal window of eligibility has closed, and he can be elected only by decision of the Hall&#x27;s Veterans Committee. Baseball historian Bill James dismissed Garcia&#x27;s low ERA due to the &quot;cold, cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which at that time had a pitcher&#x27;s mound higher than white cliffs of Dover&quot;. Referring to Garcia&#x27;s great seasons of 1949 to 1954, baseball historian Wayne Corbett countered, &quot;Garcia&#x27;s more famous teammates enjoyed the same home-field advantage, but it was Garcia who recorded the staff&#x27;s lowest ERA in four of those six seasons.&quot; Historian Stephen Lombardi wrote, &quot;It is a shame that Mike Garcia is sometimes disregarded. A career such as his does not deserve to fade away from the memory of the overall baseball public.&quot; Cleveland sportswriter and Hall of Fame voter Hal Lebovitz wrote, &quot;If Garcia had pitched long enough, he probably would be in the Hall of Fame.&quot;

Teammates have recalled the difficulty that Garcia presented for opposing hitters. George Strickland, who roomed with Garcia on road trips for several seasons, described Garcia as &quot;a big, strong, powerful pitcher&quot; who threw a &quot;very heavy ball.&quot; Bob Lemon describes his pitches similarly. &quot;Hitting a Garcia pitch was like hitting a shotput&quot;, Lemon said. Lemon also commented on his deceptive control. &quot;Mike was a sneak. His physical size belied really fine control&quot;, said Lemon.

Garcia was named one of the 100 Greatest Indians in March 2001 and inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame on August 11, 2007. Each year, the Indians organization gives the Mike Garcia Award to an area high school student who demonstrates &quot;outstanding success in the classroom, on the field, and in their community.&quot;

<doc id="576139" wikidata="Q652019" url="?curid=576139" title="Into the Fire (album)">
<text>Into the Fire is the fifth studio album by the Canadian rock singer Bryan Adams. It was co-written by Jim Vallance. It was released on 30 March 1987 by A&amp;M Records as the follow-up album to the chart-topping &quot;Reckless&quot; (1984). &quot;Into the Fire&quot; peaked at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and reached the Top 10 in several other nations. Six singles were released from the album: &quot;Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot;, &quot;Victim of Love&quot;, &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot;, &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot;.

==Music==

===Recording and production===
The recording for &quot;Into the Fire&quot; started on 16 August 1986 and finished on 24 October. It was recorded at a studio set up in Adams&#x27; home in Vancouver, British Columbia. Adams and his backing band, which consisted of Keith Scott, Mickey Curry, Dave Taylor and Tommy Mandel, used the dining room, bathroom and bedroom to isolate the different instruments. The studio was named Cliffhanger since Adams&#x27; house was close to the sea. &quot;Heat of the Night&quot; was recorded 12 September 1986. &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; was originally written for &quot;Reckless&quot; in 1984, but was recorded on 1 September 1986. &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; was mixed in London, England on 11 January.

By the time &quot;Into the Fire&quot; was completed, Adams and Vallance were satisfied with only two songs: The dark &quot;Victim of Love&quot; and the upbeat &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot;. A possible influence to the album was Adams&#x27; involvement of the six-city &quot;Amnesty International Conspiracy of Hope&quot; tour in 1986. Adams says in the &quot;Into the Fire&quot; songbook that the album&#x27;s title track refers to a man who is at a crossroads and does not quite know what to do with his life, which is how Adams felt when he started recording the album after the massive success of &quot;Reckless&quot;.

==Release and reception==

The album was released on 30 March 1987 and featured the singles &quot;Heat of the Night&quot; and &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot;. Though commercially successful, peaking at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the expectations for &quot;Into The Fire&quot; were set by the overwhelming success of Adams&#x27; previous number one hit album &quot;Reckless&quot;. That album had sold over 12 million; in that context &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, which sold over 2 million copies worldwide at its time of release, was viewed as a commercial failure.

As Adams said:

&quot;I have to laugh when the press say that LP didn&#x27;t do well because it did as well as &quot;Cuts Like a Knife&quot;, but I suppose the perception was it wasn&#x27;t &quot;Reckless II&quot;! Who cares? There were some songs that were slightly different than what we had written before ... some were, let&#x27;s say, slightly more exploratory than we&#x27;d written in the past. Vallance was up for the songwriting challenge of not repeating &quot;Reckless&quot;.&quot;
Critical reception was generally unfavourable, with the album&#x27;s lyrics being particularly singled out as substandard. Robert Christgau knocked &quot;Into The Fire&quot; for its &quot;dumbness density&quot;, noting that he counted &quot;an astonishing fifty-six full-fledged clichés on what&#x27;s supposed to be a significance move.&quot;

Steve Hochman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; expressed similar sentiments:

&quot;Adams shows that he has a will to speak but nothing in particular to say...a scan of the song titles (&quot;Heat of the Night,&quot; &quot;Only the Strong Survive,&quot; &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and so on) shows that the best Adams and co-writer Jim Vallance could come up with was a series of clichés.

... Worse are the vague pro-Native American message of &quot;Native Son&quot; and the antiwar message of &quot;Remembrance Day,&quot; the lyrics of which read like earnest but clumsy high-school poetry.
A retrospective review from Eduardo Rivera at AllMusic characterized most of the album&#x27;s songs as &quot;lifeless and dull&quot;, with some even being called &quot;depressing&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot; or &quot;truly awful&quot;. Only &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; met with Rivera&#x27;s critical approval.

&quot;Heat of the Night&quot; was the debut single from &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and was released worldwide in March 1987. In the US, the song ascended to number 2 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Heat of the Night&quot; reached number 7 on the Canadian singles chart and remained in the top ten for five weeks. In Canada, the compact disc release became the first by a Canadian artist to earn a Gold certification (sales of 50,000 units), and only the second overall following &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; by Dire Straits. &quot;Heat of the Night&quot; was released the following month in the UK and peaked in the top 50 on the UK Singles Chart at 50, and was Adams&#x27; only single from &quot;Into the Fire&quot; to chart in mainland Europe. &quot;Heat of the Night&quot; was eventually nominated for a Canadian Juno Award for Single of the Year in 1987.

&quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; was the second single from &quot;Into the Fire&quot;. The song become a minor hit at its time of release. The song peaked at number 26 on the Hot 100 chart and at number 3 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart while reaching number 25 in Canada.

&quot;Victim of Love&quot; and &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot; would be the two follow-up singles to &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot;. These singles became minor hits with &quot;Victim of Love&quot; reaching number 10 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, number 32 on the Hot 100 and number 49 on the Canadian Singles chart. &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot; reached number 47 in Canada. &quot;Another Day&quot;, which was released as the B-side to &quot;In the Heat of Night&quot;, peaked at number 33 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The title track also received airplay on American album-oriented rock radio stations and reached number 6 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

&quot;Native Son&quot; was covered by Dan Ar Braz on his 1991 album &quot;Frontières de sel&quot;.

<doc id="576140" wikidata="Q336480" url="?curid=576140" title="James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern">
<text>James Peter Hymers Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern (born 2 July 1927) is a British lawyer. He served as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Lord Advocate, and Lord Chancellor (1987–1997). He is a former active member of the House of Lords, where he sat as a Conservative. He retired from the House on 22 July 2022.

==Early life and education==
Mackay was born in Edinburgh on 2 July 1927. He won a scholarship to George Heriot&#x27;s School, and then studied mathematics and physics at the University of Edinburgh, receiving a joint MA in 1948. He taught mathematics for two years at the University of St Andrews before moving to Trinity College, Cambridge, on a scholarship, from which he obtained a BA in mathematics in 1952. He then returned to Edinburgh University where he studied law, receiving an LLB (with distinction) in 1955.

==Career==

Mackay was elected to the Faculty of Advocates in 1955. He was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1965. He was Sheriff Principal for Renfrew and Argyll from 1972 to 1974. In 1973 he became Vice-Dean of the Faculty on Advocates and from 1976 until 1979 served as its Dean, the leader of the Scots bar.

In 1979, Mackay was appointed Lord Advocate, the senior law officer in Scotland, and was created a life peer as Baron Mackay of Clashfern, of Eddrachillis in the District of Sutherland, taking his territorial designation from his father&#x27;s birthplace, a cottage beside Loch na Claise Fearna. After his retirement, Mackay sat in the House of Lords. He was also Commissary to the University of Cambridge until 2016. He is the editor-in-chief of &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England&quot;, the major legal work which states the law of England, first published in 1907; the post is usually held by a former Lord Chancellor. He is also a senior fellow of The Trinity Forum, a Christian nonprofit organisation that supports the renewal of society through the development of leaders.

==Family and religion==

Mackay is the son of railway signalman James Mackay (who came from Claisfearn near Tarbet in Sutherland) and his wife Janet Hymers. Mackay married Elizabeth Gunn Hymers, of Halkirk, in 1958. They have a son, James and two daughters, Elizabeth and Shona. Mackay was raised a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland; as an adult he was an elder of the church. The church forbids its members to attend Catholic religious services; nevertheless Mackay attended two Catholic funeral masses for members of the judiciary (for Charles Ritchie Russell in 1986, and again for John Wheatley in 1988). Following the second mass Mackay was called before a church synod where he denied that he had broken the church&#x27;s prohibition of showing &quot;support for the doctrine of Catholicism&quot;, saying &quot;I went there purely with the purpose of paying my respects to my dead colleagues.&quot; The church suspended Mackay from the eldership and from membership. The synod met again in Glasgow in 1989 to review the decision; the meeting asked Mackay to undertake not to attend further Catholic services, but he announced &quot;I have no intention of giving any such undertaking as that for which the synod has asked&quot;, and later withdrew from the church. The dispute precipitated a schism, leading to the formation of the Associated Presbyterian Churches. Mackay did not join the new communion, but worshipped with their Inverness congregation.

As a Presbyterian, Mackay was a firm believer in moderation. At a gathering for the Faculty of Advocates, Mackay had laid on a spread of tea and toast, complete with a tiny pot of honey. One of the lawyers in attendance contemplated the pot and remarked, &quot;I see your Lordship keeps a bee.&quot; Mackay is also the Honorary President of the Scottish Bible Society. He supported the society&#x27;s programme to send a Bible to every court in Scotland and wrote in support of &quot;The Bible in Scots Law&quot;, a pamphlet it distributed to Scottish lawyers which described the Bible as a &quot;foundational source book for Scotland&#x27;s legal system&quot;. He is a strict sabbatarian, refusing to work or travel on a Sunday, or even to give an interview if there is a chance it could be rebroadcast on the sabbath.

==Honours and arms==

Mackay was appointed a Knight of the Thistle by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 November 1997. In 2007 the Queen appointed him to the office of Lord Clerk Register, replacing David Charteris, 12th Earl of Wemyss. He retired from this office in November 2022, and was succeeded by Lady Elish Angiolini. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1984. In 1989, he was elected honorary fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1990. He was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Laws) by the University of Bath in 1994 and by Northumbria University in 2017.

<text>Amyloplasts are a type of plastid, double-enveloped organelles in plant cells that are involved in various biological pathways. Amyloplasts are specifically a type of leucoplast, a subcategory for colorless, non-pigment-containing plastids. Amyloplasts are found in roots and storage tissues, and they store and synthesize starch for the plant through the polymerization of glucose. Starch synthesis relies on the transportation of carbon from the cytosol, the mechanism by which is currently under debate.

Starch synthesis and storage also takes place in chloroplasts, a type of pigmented plastid involved in photosynthesis. Amyloplasts and chloroplasts are closely related, and amyloplasts can turn into chloroplasts; this is for instance observed when potato tubers are exposed to light and turn green.

==Role in gravity sensing==

Amyloplasts are thought to play a vital role in gravitropism. Statoliths, a specialized starch-accumulating amyloplast, are denser than cytoplasm, and are able to settle to the bottom of the gravity-sensing cell, called a statocyte. This settling is a vital mechanism in plant&#x27;s perception of gravity, triggering the asymmetrical distribution of auxin that causes the curvature and growth of stems against the gravity vector, as well as growth of roots along the gravity vector. A plant lacking in phosphoglucomutase (pgm), for example, is a starchless mutant plant, thus preventing the settling of the statoliths. This mutant shows a significantly weaker gravitropic response as compared to a non-mutant plant. A normal gravitropic response can be rescued with hypergravity.
In roots, gravity is sensed in the root cap, a section of tissue at the very tip of the root. Upon removal of the root cap, the root loses its ability to sense gravity. However, if the root cap is regrown, the root&#x27;s gravitropic response will recover.
In stems, gravity is sensed in the endodermal cells of the shoots.

<doc id="576155" wikidata="Q831709" url="?curid=576155" title="Chromoplast">
<text>Chromoplasts are plastids, heterogeneous organelles responsible for pigment synthesis and storage in specific photosynthetic eukaryotes. It is thought (according to symbiogenesis) that like all other plastids including chloroplasts and leucoplasts they are descended from symbiotic prokaryotes.

== Function ==
Chromoplasts are found in fruits, flowers, roots, and stressed and aging leaves, and are responsible for their distinctive colors. This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. The conversion of chloroplasts to chromoplasts in ripening is a classic example.

They are generally found in mature tissues and are derived from preexisting mature plastids. Fruits and flowers are the most common structures for the biosynthesis of carotenoids, although other reactions occur there as well including the synthesis of sugars, starches, lipids, aromatic compounds, vitamins, and hormones. The DNA in chloroplasts and chromoplasts is identical. One subtle difference in DNA was found after a liquid chromatography analysis of tomato chromoplasts was conducted, revealing increased cytosine methylation.

Chromoplasts synthesize and store pigments such as orange carotene, yellow xanthophylls, and various other red pigments. As such, their color varies depending on what pigment they contain. The main evolutionary purpose of chromoplasts is probably to attract pollinators or eaters of colored fruits, which help disperse seeds. However, they are also found in roots such as carrots and sweet potatoes. They allow the accumulation of large quantities of water-insoluble compounds in otherwise watery parts of plants.

When leaves change color in the autumn, it is due to the loss of green chlorophyll, which unmasks preexisting carotenoids. In this case, relatively little new carotenoid is produced—the change in plastid pigments associated with leaf senescence is somewhat different from the active conversion to chromoplasts observed in fruit and flowers.

There are some species of flowering plants that contain little to no carotenoids. In such cases, there are plastids present within the petals that closely resemble chromoplasts and are sometimes visually indistinguishable. Anthocyanins and flavonoids located in the cell vacuoles are responsible for other colors of pigment.

The term &quot;chromoplast&quot; is occasionally used to include &quot;any&quot; plastid that has pigment, mostly to emphasize the difference between them and the various types of leucoplasts, plastids that have no pigments. In this sense, chloroplasts are a specific type of chromoplast. Still, &quot;chromoplast&quot; is more often used to denote plastids with pigments other than chlorophyll.

==Structure and classification==
Using a light microscope chromoplasts can be differentiated and are classified into four main types. The first type is composed of proteic stroma with granules. The second is composed of protein crystals and amorphous pigment granules. The third type is composed of protein and pigment crystals. The fourth type is a chromoplast which only contains crystals. 
An electron microscope reveals even more, allowing for the identification of substructures such as globules, crystals, membranes, fibrils and tubules. The substructures found in chromoplasts are not found in the mature plastid that it divided from.

The presence, frequency and identification of substructures using an electron microscope has led to further classification, dividing chromoplasts into five main categories: Globular chromoplasts, crystalline chromoplasts, fibrillar chromoplasts, tubular chromoplasts and membranous chromoplasts. It has also been found that different types of chromoplasts can coexist in the same organ. Some examples of plants in the various categories include mangoes, which have globular chromoplasts, and carrots which have crystalline chromoplasts.
Although some chromoplasts are easily categorized, others have characteristics from multiple categories that make them hard to place. Tomatoes accumulate carotenoids, mainly lycopene crystalloids in membrane-shaped structures, which could place them in either the crystalline or membranous category.

==Evolution==

Plastids lining which pollinators visit a flower, as specific colors attract specific pollinators. White flowers tend to attract beetles, bees are most often attracted to violet and blue flowers, and butterflies are often attracted to warmer colors like yellows and oranges.

==Research==
Chromoplasts are not widely studied and are rarely the main focus of scientific research. They often play a role in research on the tomato plant (&quot;Solanum lycopersicum&quot;). Lycopene is responsible for the red color of a ripe fruit in the cultivated tomato, while the yellow color of the flowers is due to xanthophylls violaxanthin and neoxanthin.

Carotenoid biosynthesis occurs in both chromoplasts and chloroplasts. In the chromoplasts of tomato flowers, carotenoid synthesis is regulated by the genes Psyl, Pds, Lcy-b, and Cyc-b. These genes, in addition to others, are responsible for the formation of carotenoids in organs and structures. For example, the Lcy-e gene is highly expressed in leaves, which results in the production of the carotenoid lutein.

White flowers are caused by a recessive allele in tomato plants. They are less desirable in cultivated crops because they have a lower pollination rate. In one study, it was found that chromoplasts are still present in white flowers. The lack of yellow pigment in their petals and anthers is due to a mutation in the CrtR-b2 gene which disrupts the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.
The entire process of chromoplast formation is not yet completely understood on the molecular level. However, electron microscopy has revealed part of the transformation from chloroplast to chromoplast. The transformation starts with remodeling of the internal membrane system with the lysis of the intergranal thylakoids and the grana. New membrane systems form in organized membrane complexes called thylakoid plexus. The new membranes are the site of the formation of carotenoid crystals. These newly synthesized membranes do not come from the thylakoids, but rather from vesicles generated from the inner membrane of the plastid. The most obvious biochemical change would be the downregulation of photosynthetic gene expression which results in the loss of chlorophyll and stops photosynthetic activity.

In oranges, the synthesis of carotenoids and the disappearance of chlorophyll causes the color of the fruit to change from green to yellow. The orange color is often added artificially—light yellow-orange is the natural color created by the actual chromoplasts.

Valencia oranges &quot;Citris sinensis L&quot; are a cultivated orange grown extensively in the state of Florida. In the winter, Valencia oranges reach their optimum orange-rind color while reverting to a green color in the spring and summer. While it was originally thought that chromoplasts were the final stage of plastid development, in 1966 it was proved that chromoplasts can revert to chloroplasts, which causes the oranges to turn back to green.

<text>Isochrony is a linguistic analysis or hypothesis assuming that any spoken language&#x27;s utterances are divisible into equal rhythmic portions of some kind. Under this assumption, languages are proposed to broadly fall into one of two categories based on rhythm or timing: syllable-timed or stress-timed languages (or, in some analyses, a third category: mora-timed languages). However, empirical studies have been unable to directly or fully support the hypothesis, so the concept remains controversial in linguistics.

== History ==
Rhythm is an aspect of prosody, others being intonation, stress, and tempo of speech. &quot;Isochrony&quot; refers to rhythmic division of time into equal portions by a language. The idea of was first expressed thus by Kenneth L. Pike in 1945, though the concept of language naturally occurring in chronologically and rhythmically equal measures is found at least as early as 1775 (in &quot;Prosodia Rationalis&quot;). Soames (1889) attributed the idea to Curwen. This has implications for linguistic typology: D. Abercrombie claimed &quot;As far as is known, every language in the world is spoken with one kind of rhythm or with the other ... French, Telugu and Yoruba ... are syllable-timed languages, ... English, Russian and Arabic ... are stress-timed languages.&quot;

While many linguists find the idea of different rhythm types appealing, empirical studies have not been able to find acoustic correlates of the postulated types, calling into question the validity of these types. However, when viewed as a matter of degree, relative differences in the variability of syllable duration across languages have been found.

== Alternative division of time ==
Three alternative ways in which a language can divide time are postulated:
# The duration of every syllable is equal (syllable-timed);
# The duration of every mora is equal (mora-timed).
# The interval between two stressed syllables is equal (stress-timed).

=== Syllable timing ===
In a syllable-timed language, every syllable is perceived as taking up roughly the same amount of time, though the absolute length of time depends on the prosody. Syllable-timed languages tend to give syllables approximately equal prominence and generally lack reduced vowels.

French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Brazilian Portuguese, Icelandic, Singlish, Cantonese, Mandarin Chinese, Armenian, Turkish and Korean are commonly quoted as examples of syllable-timed languages. This type of rhythm was originally metaphorically referred to as &quot;machine-gun rhythm&quot; because each underlying rhythmical unit is of the same duration, similar to the transient bullet noise of a machine gun.

Since the 1950s, speech scientists have tried to show the existence of equal syllable durations in the acoustic speech signal without success. More recent research claims that the duration of consonantal and vocalic intervals is responsible for syllable-timed perception.

=== Mora timing ===
Some languages like Japanese, Gilbertese, Slovak and Ganda also have regular pacing but are mora-timed, rather than syllable-timed. In Japanese, a V or CV syllable takes up one timing unit. Japanese does not have diphthongs but &quot;double&quot; vowels, so CVV takes roughly twice the time as CV. A final /N/ also takes roughly as much time as a CV syllable, as does the extra length of a geminate consonant.

Ancient Greek and Vedic Sanskrit were also strictly mora-timed. Classical Persian was also mora-timed, though most modern dialects are not. Mora-timing is still common when reciting classical Persian poetry and music.

=== Stress timing ===
In a &quot;stress-timed language&quot;, syllables may last different amounts of time, but there is perceived to be a fairly constant amount of time (on average) between consecutive stressed syllables. Consequently, unstressed syllables between stressed syllables tend to be compressed to fit into the time interval: if two stressed syllables are separated by a single unstressed syllable, as in &quot;delicious tea&quot;, the unstressed syllable will be relatively long, while if a larger number of unstressed syllables intervenes, as in &quot;tolerable tea&quot;, the unstressed syllables will be shorter.

Stress-timing is sometimes called &quot;Morse-code rhythm&quot;, but any resemblance between the two is only superficial. Stress-timing is strongly related to vowel reduction processes. English, Thai, Lao, German, Russian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Faroese, Dutch, European Portuguese, and Iranian Persian are typical stress-timed languages. Some stress-timed languages (for example Arabic) retain unreduced vowels.

==Degrees of durational variability==
Despite the relative simplicity of the classifications above, in the real world languages do not fit quite so easily into such precise categories. Languages exhibit degrees of durational variability both in relation to other languages and to other standards of the same language.

There can be varying degrees of stress-timing within the various standards of a language. Some southern dialects of Italian, a syllable-timed language, are effectively stress-timed. English, a stress-timed language, has become so widespread that some standards tend to be more syllable-timed than the British or North American standards, an effect which comes from the influence of other languages spoken in the relevant region. Indian English, for example, tends toward syllable-timing. This does not necessarily mean the language standard itself is to be classified as syllable-timed, of course, but rather that this feature is more pronounced. A subtle example is that to a native English speaker, for example, some accents from Wales may sound more syllable-timed.

A better-documented case of these varying degrees of stress-timing in a language comes from Portuguese. European Portuguese is more stress-timed than the Brazilian standard. The latter has mixed characteristics and varies according to speech rate, sex and dialect. At fast speech rates, Brazilian Portuguese is more stress-timed, while in slow speech rates, it can be more syllable-timed. The accents of rural, southern Rio Grande do Sul and the Northeast (especially Bahia) are considered to sound more syllable-timed than the others, while the southeastern dialects such as the &quot;mineiro&quot;, in central Minas Gerais, the &quot;paulistano&quot;, of the northern coast and eastern regions of São Paulo, and the &quot;fluminense&quot;, along Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and eastern Minas Gerais as well the Federal District, are most frequently essentially stress-timed. Also, male speakers of Brazilian Portuguese speak faster than female speakers and speak in a more stress-timed manner.

Linguist Peter Ladefoged has proposed (citing work by Grabe and Low ) that, since languages differ from each other in terms of the amount of difference between the durations of vowels in adjacent syllables, it is possible to calculate a Pairwise Variability Index (PVI) from measured vowel durations to quantify the differences. The data show that, for example, Dutch (traditionally classed as a stress-timed language) exhibits a higher PVI than Spanish (traditionally a syllable-timed language).

==The stress-timing–syllable-timing distinction as a continuum==
Given the lack of solid evidence for a clear-cut categorical distinction between the two rhythmical types, it seems reasonable to suggest instead that &quot;all&quot; languages (and all their accents) display &quot;both&quot; types of rhythm to a greater or lesser extent. T. F. Mitchell claimed that there is no language which is totally syllable-timed or totally stress-timed; rather, all languages display both sorts of timing. Languages will, however, differ in which type of timing predominates. This view was developed by Dauer in such a way that a metric was provided allowing researchers to place any language on a scale from maximally stress-timed to maximally syllable-timed. Examples of this approach in use are Dimitrova&#x27;s study of Bulgarian and Olivo&#x27;s study of the rhythm of Ashanti Twi.

According to Dafydd Gibbon and Briony Williams, Welsh is neither syllable-timed nor stress-timed, as syllable length varies less than in stress-timed languages.

<text>Mischief Makers is a side-scrolling platform game developed for the Nintendo 64 gaming console by Treasure, and published in 1997 by Enix in Japan and by Nintendo internationally. The player assumes the role of Marina Liteyears, a robotic maid who journeys to rescue her creator, Professor Theo, from the emperor of Planet Clancer. The gameplay is displayed in 2.5D, based on grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects within five worlds and 52 levels.

It is the first 2D side-scrolling game for the Nintendo 64, and Treasure&#x27;s first release for a Nintendo console. The 12-person team began development in mid-1995 with little knowledge of the prototype console. The team wanted to make a novel gameplay mechanic, and implementing the resultant &quot;catching&quot; technique became their most difficult task. The game was announced at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was released in Japan on June 27 that year and later in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

&quot;Mischief Makers&quot; received mixed reviews. Critics praised its inventiveness, personality, and boss fights, but criticized its short length, low difficulty, low replay value, sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina&#x27;s signature &quot;Shake, shake!&quot; sound bite as a highlight. Video game journalists appealed for its reissue either through the Nintendo eShop or in a sequel or franchise reboot. In 2009, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; called it possibly the most underrated Nintendo 64 game.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mischief Makers&quot; is the first single-player 2D side-scrolling platform game on the Nintendo 64. Its gameplay combines platform game mechanics with aspects from the action and puzzle genres. The characters and backgrounds are modeled in pre-rendered 3D similar to &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;″s &quot;Advanced Computer Modeling&quot;. This style, with 3D backgrounds behind 2D gameplay, is known as 2.5D. Its gameplay is more exploratory than previous run-and-gun games from Treasure.

The player-character, a robotic maid named Marina, journeys to save her kidnapped creator. The story takes place on Planet Clancer, a world on the cusp of civil war due to the actions of its Emperor and his Imperial forces. The Emperor brainwashes Clancers to kidnap the visiting robotics genius Professor Theo. Theo&#x27;s creation, the player-character Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, pursues the professor and grabs, throws, and shakes the obstacles in her way, such as enemies, floating &quot;Clanball&quot; platforms, warp stars, and missiles. Almost all game objects can be grabbed, which lends towards the shake-based combat system. Marina can shake &quot;grabbed&quot; objects to throw them as projectiles or to find loot. Objects sometimes change functions when shaken, such as items that become homing missiles and guns with multi-directional shots. Some drop red, blue, and green gems, which restore player health. The health gauge in the corner of the screen shows the amount of damage Marina can take. The player can store up to two additional stock lives. Yellow gems hidden in each level extend the final cutscene&#x27;s length. Marina can run, jump, and boost (via jetpack) in the eight cardinal and ordinal directions. She can also slide, hover, and roll.

The game has five worlds with roughly twelve levels apiece. Some levels are action-only while others include puzzles. The player&#x27;s goal is to reach a warp star at each level&#x27;s end. En route, Marina shakes enemies, breaks blocks, uses weapons, and rides &quot;bikes&quot; and objects along wire path mazes. Each world has both final and mid-level bosses. The levels and boss fights use scaling and screen rotation special effects to vary the gameplay.

Almost all things on Planet Clancerincluding people, buildings, and petseither wear or are inscribed with identical &quot;sad&quot; faces with red, glowing eyes. A Clancer named Teran substitutes for Marina in several brief areas and uses non-shake mechanics like punching, kicking, and double jumping. A character named Calina, a petulant Clancer who imitates Marina, recurs as a comedic device.

==Development==

Treasure began to develop &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; in mid-1995, before the Nintendo 64&#x27;s launch in mid-1996. At the time, little was known about the prototype console&#x27;s future final technical specifications, graphics implementation, and development kit, but were nevertheless interested in the console and its improved &quot;pixel quality&quot;. Historically, Treasure developed games exclusively for Sega consoles, which made &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; its first release for a Nintendo console. Choosing the Nintendo 64 was a hardware-based decision; the Nintendo 64 Game Pak cartridges were more expensive than CD-ROMs, but they loaded data instantly and were thus more conducive for action games such as this. However, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa said that development for the Nintendo 64 had a harsher learning curve than even the Sega Saturn. Other than the special attention required to build a single boss in 3D, the team did not use features specific to the Nintendo 64 hardware.

Treasure&#x27;s founders had come from Konami, where they had worked on Nintendo Entertainment System games such as &quot;Castlevania&quot; and &quot;Contra&quot;. They found their development environment restrictive and left to try riskier concepts and to singularly focus on making &quot;great games&quot;. In the three years between Treasure&#x27;s founding and &quot;Mischief Makers&quot;″s development, the company released highly regarded games such as &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;known as &quot;one of the definitive 16-bit action games&quot;and &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;. An average of 12 people worked on &quot;Mischief Makers&quot;, with up to 15 at times. Though the team was different in composition from that of previous Treasure games, it included the lead programmer and character designer from &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;. Treasure&#x27;s CEO said that the staff liked to expand into new genres, though primarily in genres where the staff had experience. The company sought to depart from the &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; shoot &#x27;em up design, and chose to build &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; around an original &quot;catching&quot; gameplay mechanic, which became the hardest aspect to implement. While foreign (non-Japanese) games were popular within the company, Treasure&#x27;s CEO said the company&#x27;s games did not look &quot;particularly foreign&quot; and could appeal to Japanese audiences.

The game is Treasure&#x27;s first to have been published by Enix. The publisher sought Treasure for its reputation in the action game genre, and had approached Treasure several times before the Nintendo 64 project surfaced. Treasure CEO Maegawa was already fond of Enix, having applied unsuccessfully to work there as a student. Upon choosing the Nintendo 64, Treasure thought it would be a &quot;good idea&quot; to work with Enix. Similar to how Treasure ended its historic loyalty to the Sega Genesis by developing &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; for Nintendo, Enix had just recently ended its historic loyalty to Nintendo by signing &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; of its &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; franchise to Sony. Neither Square or Enix built a &quot;special relationship&quot; with Nintendo specific for &quot;Mischief Makers&quot;″s release, though Nintendo was the publisher for Western markets. Prior to Nintendo proposing to publish the game in the West, Enix said it had no plans to release it outside Japan. When its English localization finished ahead of schedule, the North American release date was advanced two weeks.

&quot;Mischief Makers&quot; was the only game displayed at the Enix booth at the April 1997 Tokyo Game Show. It was later demonstrated at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo and released in Japan on June 27, 1997, the United States on October 1, in Europe on December 12, and in Australia in 1998. Its Japanese title is &quot;Yuke-Yuke Trouble Makers&quot;, or &quot;Go-Go Trouble Makers&quot;. Near the Japanese launch, Treasure announced that it would continue to develop for the Nintendo 64 with the Japan-only &quot;Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh&quot;, which was released in September and later introduced to North America as &quot;Bangai-O&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Mischief Makers&quot; received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic, and a &quot;Gold Hall of Fame&quot; score of 32/40 from Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;. Critics praised the inventiveness, personality, &quot;variety&quot;, and boss fights, and criticized the brevity, low difficulty, low replay value, sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers were more positive, and multiple reviewers noted Marina&#x27;s signature &quot;Shake, shake!&quot; sound bite as a highlight. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarded the game its silver award.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Matt Casamassina said that the game compensated for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges. He added that the puzzles require thought, unlike those in other action games, and that the objectives were not clear until after the first few levels. Casamassina praised the transparency effects, anti-aliasing, mipmapping, and scaling rotations. &quot;IGN&quot; described anticipation for the game as &quot;tremendous&quot;, particularly among the target market of &quot;younger gamers and 2D fans&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; said that the game was the best side-scroller since &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; wrote that &quot;only diehard 2D platform fans&quot; would be interested and that the game did not meet standards set by &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. In contrast, &quot;GameFan&quot; said that &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; did for 2D what &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; did for 3D, and suggested that Sega should be influenced. &quot;GamePro&quot; instead argued that the similarity to &quot;Mario&quot; is superficial, and that &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; had carved out its own niche with unique gameplay mechanics. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; retrospectively called it &quot;pure, unadulterated awesome&quot; and &quot;2D brilliance&quot;. The website summarized the game as about &quot;grabbing sad-faced aliens, shaking them until gems come out, and then hurling them at other sad-faced aliens&quot;. Zachary Miller of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; said that it may be most bizarre and surreal Nintendo 64 game, but &quot;Gamasutra&quot;″s John Harris said that the premise is &quot;only strange to people who have never heard of anime&quot;. &quot;GameFan&quot; described the game as &quot;obviously deeply Japanese&quot;, where &quot;old school gameplay and 64-bit visuals finally meet&quot;.

Hirokazu Hamamura of &quot;Famitsu&quot; commended the gameplay for balancing against its poor character design. Other &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewers admired Treasure&#x27;s signature robot designs and were puzzled by the company&#x27;s choice to use buttons instead of the 3D analog stick. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Jamie O&#x27;Neill praised the characters and disliked the controls. He compared the Calina character to the role of Shadow Mario in &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;. O&#x27;Neill wrote that the intricate controls were &quot;the antithesis of a friendly, approachable, and intuitive platformer&quot; because they used every button on the controller (including the directional pad), though he said that players who persevered through the difficult controls would find them &quot;inventive and unique&quot;. He added that the complex controls allowed for experimentation that led to new and fun gameplay, and though the throwing enemies mechanic seemed to follow from &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, the Clanball platforming was unintuitive. John Harris of &quot;Gamasutra&quot; wrote that the game borrowed other elements from &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, with similar protagonists, collectible gems, and bosses. Harris also put Marina&#x27;s &quot;grab&quot; in a lineage of Treasure&#x27;s signature counterattack mechanics (where a player can escape an attack with a well-timed button press), which he extrapolated out to counterattacks in &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; and &quot;Soul Calibur&quot;. As the game took time to learn and understand, O&#x27;Neill left the reader to decide whether it was &quot;ultimately convoluted or bordering on sophistication and genius&quot;.

&quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s O&#x27;Neill thought the five world bosses were among Treasure&#x27;s best (in particular, the transforming &quot;Cerberus Alpha&quot; boss), but found the mid-level bosses uninteresting. Peter Bartholow of &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s reviewers remarked similarly. Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; added that the technique of looking for a boss&#x27;s weak spot was similar to &quot;Metroid&quot;. &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewers praised how the game encouraged players to experiment with the basic &quot;grab, throw, and shake&quot; gameplay, and praised the cadence of the short levels. O&#x27;Neill of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said it had great variety in gameplay mechanics (from maze puzzles to outrunning lava), graphics (from bosses that scale back the screen to levels with screen rotation), and audio (from upbeat quirk to scary), and added that he was surprised that other critics were against the &quot;unique, varied, and dramatic&quot; sound. &quot;GamePro&quot; also praised the varied stage objectives, and said the &quot;whimsical&quot; music and sound effects worked perfectly with each stage, though found the voice acting overly cutesy. Scott McCall of &quot;AllGame&quot; also appreciated the sound, from the voice to the &quot;almost indescribable&quot; music. &quot;Gamasutra&quot;″s John Harris noted its &quot;tremendous variety&quot; in gameplayfrom a &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; remake to outrunning a missile barrageas rare for 2D platformers, and commented that &quot;it is obvious that Treasure poured their hearts into this game&quot;.

Peter Bartholow of &quot;GameSpot&quot; summarized &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; as &quot;a good game that will leave players wanting more&quot;. He liked the bosses, which made the player use all available skills but said they were short-lived and easily solved in the context of a short game with tutorials as one-fifth of its levels. He did not consider the ending extension a suitable reward for returning to the levels, and predicted that most players would not finish the game more than once. &quot;Game Informer&quot; echoed Bartholow&#x27;s comments about the brevity, and named the seven-event Olympics as a highlight. Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; wrote that the game seemed incomplete and lamented that &quot;a decent player can finish the game in under three hours&quot;, though &quot;Next Generation&quot; said it was &quot;certainly long enough&quot;. The game&#x27;s frequent reuse of a small selection of titles, objects, sound effects, soundtracks, and bland backgrounds (compared to the &quot;impressive&quot; boss battle animations and effects) led &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Bartholow to suggest that &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; was limited by its cartridge space. He concluded that the &quot;decent&quot; game would be &quot;truly excellent ... on another medium&quot;. Zachary Miller of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; reported that the graphics did not age well into 2010. Dan Hsu wrote in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; that the game is &quot;definitely a sleeper hit&quot;. &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot;″s Ryan Cartmel said it went &quot;largely unnoticed&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot; claimed that it had &quot;[developed] a strong following in Japan&quot;.

===Legacy===
Video game journalists from sources such as &quot;GamesRadar&quot; and &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; cited &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; as suited for reissue either through the Nintendo eShop or in a sequel or franchise reboot. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; placed the &quot;masterpiece of mayhem&quot; 80th on its list of &quot;essential&quot; Nintendo 64 games for its &quot;unbridled quality&quot;. In 2009, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; called it &quot;possibly the most underrated and widely ignored&quot; Nintendo 64 game. In the years since, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; reported &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; as a somewhat rare collectible, with a rarity score of 7/10. The website wrote that &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; was received poorly because players wanted 3D instead of 2D gameplay in Nintendo 64 games. &quot;Gamasutra&quot;″s John Harris added that those who gave it a &quot;bum rap&quot; missed a &quot;surprisingly clever&quot; game. UGO remembered it as innovative, though imperfect, and asked to see Marina reinterpreted and resurrected in a new game. Marina reappeared as an unlockable character in Treasure&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Rakugaki Showtime&quot;.

<doc id="576162" wikidata="Q1585925" url="?curid=576162" title="Pop-Tarts">
<text>Pop-Tarts (stylized as pop•tarts) is an American brand of toaster pastries produced and distributed by Kellanova (formerly Kellogg&#x27;s) since 1964, consisting of a sweet filling sealed inside two layers of thin, rectangular pastry crust. Most varieties are also frosted. Although sold precooked, they are designed to be warmed inside a toaster or microwave oven. They are usually sold in pairs inside Mylar (previously foil) packages and do not require refrigeration.

Pop-Tarts is Kellanova&#x27;s most popular brand to date in the United States, with millions of units sold each year. They are distributed mainly in the United States, but are also available in Canada and the United Kingdom.

Pop-Tarts are produced in dozens of flavors, plus various one-time, seasonal, and &quot;limited-edition&quot; flavors that appear for a short time.

== History ==
In the early 1960s, Kellogg&#x27;s biggest competitor, Post, invented a process for dehydrating food and enclosing it in foil to keep it fresh. Originally used for dog food, they were looking to expand their breakfast market and adapted the process to a new toaster-prepared breakfast pastry. Post announced its new product to the press in 1964 several months before they went to market, calling them &quot;Country Squares&quot;.

Because Post had revealed Country Squares before they were ready for the marketplace, Kellogg&#x27;s rushed to develop their own version. They hired Bill Post, a former Keebler employee, for the task and created their own breakfast pastry in just four months. Initially called Fruit Scones, the name was soon changed to Pop-Tarts as a pun on the then popular Pop Art movement. The product became so popular that Kellogg could not keep up with demand. The first shipment of Pop-Tarts to stores sold out in two weeks, and Kellogg&#x27;s ran advertisements apologizing for the empty shelves. This only increased demand.

The first Pop-Tarts came in four flavors: strawberry, blueberry, brown sugar cinnamon, and apple currant, which was soon renamed apple-berry. Originally unfrosted when first introduced in 1964, Kellogg&#x27;s soon developed a frosting that could withstand the toaster, and the first frosted Pop-Tarts were released in 1967. Sprinkles were added to several flavors in 1968.

As of 2024, there are over 24 standard Pop-Tart flavors, including hot fudge sundae, s&#x27;mores, raspberry, and grape.

Pop-Tarts were introduced with fairly substantial marketing to the United Kingdom in the early 1990s. Chocotastic and Strawberry Sensation are available in most major UK supermarkets.

The United States military airdropped 2.4 million Pop-Tarts in Afghanistan during the initial attack in 2001.

A temporary store called Pop-Tarts World opened in Times Square on August 10, 2010 which included Pop-Tarts memorabilia, T-shirt making, a Pop-Tarts World Cafe featuring a sushi bar, and a vending machine called the Varietizer. The store closed on December 31, 2010.

, sales of Pop-Tarts had increased for 32 straight years.

In 2023, Pop-Tarts became a product of Kellanova following the spinoff of Kellogg&#x27;s breakfast cereal operations into WK Kellogg Co. Sales continued to increase year after year, topping $985 million in 2023.

==Products==
Kellanova keeps between 20 and 30 flavors in production at any time, and is constantly testing and trying new flavors to meet shifting consumer tastes.

===Standard flavors===
Pop Tart&#x27;s core flavors have been unchanged for over 50 years and include favorites such as frosted strawberry and brown sugar cinnamon. In addition, Kellanova is constantly introducing new flavors into regular production and removing ones that do not sell well. In 2020, they introduced three new Pretzel flavors while ceasing production of most of the &#x27;wild&#x27; flavor line.

===Seasonal flavors===
Kellanova produces some flavors for a short time every year, to coincide with seasonal or holiday events. Some examples include Pumpkin Pie, released every Fall since 2011, and Red White and Blueberry, brought back every summer since 2012.

===Limited flavors===
Between 2005–2021, Kellogg&#x27;s produced special Limited flavors. These were each released for only a short time, about six months, and had a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; banner on the box. They were sometimes made in cooperation with another food brand, such as Dunkin Donuts, Jolly Rancher, and A&amp;W Root Beer. They have also worked with other Kellogg&#x27;s brands to make Froot Loops and Eggo flavored Pop-Tarts.

Occasionally a limited flavor would sell so well that Kellogg&#x27;s kept producing it longer or made it a standard flavor. Red Velvet was initially released as a limited flavor in 2013, but sold so well that it was kept in production until 2017 and returned as a standard flavor in 2021.

In the summer of 2021, the Limited flavor &quot;Mister-E&quot; was discontinued shortly after its two-month marketing surge. Kellogg&#x27;s pulled the plug on the flavor after receiving numerous complaints. It was confirmed to be known as &quot;Everything Bagel&quot; on the Pop-Tart website prior to its conclusion.

===Outside the United States===
A much more limited number of flavors are available outside the US. This is due to local laws that may prohibit the use of specific food dyes, or the use of high fructose corn syrup.

Only three flavors are available in Europe:

* Frosted Apple Blast
* Frosted Chocotastic 
* Frosted Strawberry Sensation

==Related products==
Danish Go-Rounds, later renamed Danish Rings, were an oval shaped tubular toaster pastry with fruit filling. Kellogg&#x27;s made them between 1968–1972.

Presto Pizza was a pizza flavored toaster pastry produced by Kellogg&#x27;s in 1971, and retired less than a year later.

Pastry Swirls were introduced in the mid-1990s and were similar to a competitor Pillsbury&#x27;s Toaster Strudels. Pastry Swirls were bigger and thicker than regular Pop-Tarts and had less icing. Flavors included Cherry Cheese Danish and Cinnamon Cream. Sales were disappointing, and the products were discontinued in 2001.

Snak-Stix, a portable break-apart version intended as an after-school snack for children, was introduced in 1999. In 2002, Kellogg&#x27;s launched a massive media promotion along with the &quot;American Idol&quot; TV show and live tour. It did not sell well and was discontinued a year later.

Go-Tarts were another attempt at a snack-sized product, released in 2006. These were thicker, narrow, and wrapped individually (instead of in packages of two). Go-Tarts were discontinued in 2008.

Mini Crisps were introduced in 2011 as a bite-sized, cracker-like pastry with no filling. They originally sold in 60-calorie pouches but were discontinued after poor sales. They were brought back in a larger size in 2018, as Pop Tart Crisps. The newer version is a larger bar-sized crispy pastry with filling and frosting.

Pop-Tarts Pastry Bites are a smaller, bite-sized version sold in pouches. They were originally introduced in 1994 as Pop-Tarts Bites, but ceased production the next year. Kellogg&#x27;s brought them back in 2018 in Frosted Strawberry and Brown Sugar Cinnamon flavors, with more flavors added in the following years.

Pop Tarts Cereal was originally made in 1994, and sold through the early 2000s. Kellogg&#x27;s brought it back in 2019 with two flavors: strawberry and brown sugar cinnamon.

Crunchy Poppers were introduced in early 2024. They are a bite sized tubular pastry with filling and frosting, smaller and more crunchy than Pop Tarts Bites. They are sold in pouches of 10.

==In popular culture==
In June 2021, Jerry Seinfeld announced he would write, direct, produce, and star in a fictionalized re-telling about the creation of Pop-Tarts. The film, &quot;Unfrosted&quot;, was released on Netflix on May 3, 2024.

The History Channel series &quot;The Food That Built America&quot; has two episodes that include Pop Tarts. The first episode of the first season includes the rivalry between the Kellogg and Post companies, and mentions the invention of the Pop-Tart. The first episode of season four goes into more detail about the creation of the Pop Tart and the rival Country Squares from Post.

The TV show &quot;Family Guy&quot; featured a song about Pop-Tarts, and how good they taste with butter.

Comedian Brian Regan includes Pop-Tarts in one of his most popular bits around how Pop-Tarts shouldn&#x27;t require instructions.

== Advertising ==
In the 1970s, Kellogg&#x27;s revitalized Pop-Tarts advertising with a talking toaster named Milton. The character, voiced by actor William Schallert in TV and radio ads, enjoyed a popular merchandising run. Products with Milton&#x27;s likeness included mugs, plates, paint sets, and even board games.

Pop-Tarts introduced a new advertising campaign, &quot;Crazy Good&quot;, in 2004. Characters that appeared often were a singing lizard and a group of children, dubbed &quot;crazy-good kids&quot;, who commonly frightened the Pop-Tarts and caused them to be eaten or chased away. The sound design and signature &quot;TaDa&quot; opening and closings were created by Kamen Entertainment Group, Inc. The ads employ squiggly animation, surrealist humor, and non sequitur, all of which bear a strong resemblance to the signature work of animator Don Hertzfeldt. However, Hertzfeldt was not involved in any way with these advertisements.

In 2006, the Children&#x27;s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, prompted by a customer complaint, &quot;recommended that Kellogg modify packaging, eliminate the phrase &#x27;made with real fruit&#x27;.&quot; Kellogg agreed to do so, and redesigned packages for the Pop-Tarts line accordingly; they assured CARU that the &quot;claim does not appear on television or print advertising&quot; and offered to &quot;participate in CARU&#x27;s self-regulatory process&quot; and &quot;take CARU&#x27;s focus areas into consideration&quot; as Kellogg proceeds with its &quot;future child-directed advertising.&quot;

In 2023, Kellanova started sponsoring the Pop-Tarts Bowl, a college football bowl game played at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. In 2023, a mascot of the strawberry Pop-Tart, went viral on social media after he descended into a massive toaster and was eaten by the winning team, Kansas State Wildcats, spurring countless memes over the internet. In 2024, the bowl held a fan vote of three flavors to serve as main mascot: Cinnamon Roll, Hot Fudge Sundae, and Wild Berry. After the Iowa State Cyclones defeated the Miami Hurricanes, MVP Rocco Becht chose Cinnamon Roll to be toasted and eaten.

Cable in the Classroom has used a Pop-Tarts television commercial as an example in its media literacy program for children. They ask adults to watch a Pop-Tarts commercial with their children or students and &quot;have them look at how much product information is presented and how much is really about lifestyle or attitude.&quot;

The Pop-Tarts name is trademarked and, similar to the word &quot;pants,&quot; there is no singular version of the word. Each individual item is still a Pop-Tarts.

== Lawsuits ==
Thomas Nangle filed a lawsuit in 1992, suing Kellogg&#x27;s for damages after his Pop-Tart became stuck in his toaster and caught fire. The case gained wider notoriety when humorist Dave Barry wrote a column about starting a fire in his own toaster with Pop-Tarts. Texas A&amp;M University Corpus Christi professor Patrick Michaud performed a 1994 experiment showing that when left in the toaster too long, strawberry Pop-Tarts could produce flames to about high. The discovery triggered a number of lawsuits. Since then, Pop-Tarts carry the warning: &quot;Due to possible risk of fire, never leave your toasting appliance or microwave unattended.&quot;

In October 2021, a woman in New York sued Kellogg&#x27;s for $5 million over what she claimed was misleading advertising about Strawberry Pop-Tarts. Her suit alleged, &quot;The strawberry representations are misleading because the Product has less strawberries than consumers expect based on the labeling.&quot; This lawsuit was dismissed in March 2022, with US District Judge Marvin Aspin writing &quot;The word &#x27;Strawberry,&#x27; combined with a picture of half of a strawberry and a Pop-Tart oozing red filling, does not guarantee that there will be a certain amount of strawberries in the product&#x27;s filling.&quot;

==Recalls==

Pop-Tarts have been the subject of recalls when mislabeling could lead to serious allergic reactions. On August 4, 1995, it was announced that 94,500 cartons of Smucker&#x27;s Real Fruit Frosted Strawberry pastries actually contained the Chocolate Fudge variety. In 2002, Kellogg alerted the public that egg was an undeclared ingredient in its Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tarts. In 2006, they alerted the public that some Frosted Blueberry Pop-Tarts contained milk as an undeclared ingredient.

<text>Fox&#x27;s U-bet chocolate syrup is a commercial chocolate syrup originally made by H. Fox &amp; Company in Brooklyn, New York starting . It was said to be invented in a basement in Brownsville, Brooklyn, according to David Fox. Herman Fox, his grandfather, left town for the Texas oil boom and returned only with the phrase &quot;you bet.&quot; U-bet syrup is best known as being a key component in the fountain beverage, the egg cream. While the specific order in preparation is subject to much debate within New York City, the components of the classic egg cream recipe consist of U-Bet syrup, milk and seltzer. The beverage has since become an iconic staple in New York&#x27;s Jewish delis since its invention in the 1880s. H. Fox &amp; Company was acquired by US Westminster Foods in 2016, and is currently manufactured in Farmingdale, New York.

<text>Tudjaat were Madeleine Allakariallak and Phoebe Atagotaaluk, two Inuit women from Nunavut, Canada who are known for their recordings and performances of traditional Inuit throat singing.

==History==

Tudjaat was founded in 1994 after producer Randall Prescott heard Allakariallak perform as part of a backup chorus with Susan Aglukark&#x27;s third CD. When he learned that Atagotaaluk, her cousin, was also a throat singer, he arranged to have the pair brought together with several backup musicians for a recording session which combined their traditional singing with modern guitar, keyboard, bass and drum music. The result was a six-track CD titled &quot;Tudjaat&quot;.

&quot;Tudjaat&quot; features &quot;Kajusita (When My Ship Comes In)&quot;, a song written by Allakariallak, Jon Park-Wheeler, and Randall Prescott. The song, which describes the forced exile of a group of Inuit to the High Arctic in the last century, is a tribute to those who suffered and died as a consequence of a government decision.

&quot;Kajusita&quot; won the CD&#x27;s its producers the 1997 American Indian Film Institute Awards Best Song award, was included on a United Nations compilation CD entitled &quot;Here and Now, A celebration of Canadian Music, The Music of The First Peoples and Folk Music&quot;, and was made into a music video. &quot;Tudjaat&quot; was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Music of Aboriginal Canada in 1997, but did not win.

The next year Tudjaat&#x27;s &quot;Qingauiit&quot;, written by Jon Park-Wheeler and Randall Prescott, was included on Putumayo&#x27;s &quot;A Native American Odyssey: Inuit to Inca&quot;. Also that year the pair&#x27;s singing was featured on Robbie Robertson&#x27;s CD &quot;Contact from the Underworld of Redboy&quot;.
After the short-lived career of Tudjaat, Allakariallak worked for the CBC Northern Service and then in 2005 became a news host on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.

<text>Jeffrey Katzenberg (; born December 21, 1950) is an American media proprietor and film producer who has been serving as president of Universal Animation Studios. He previously served as chairman of Walt Disney Studios from 1984 to 1994, a position in which he oversaw production and business operations for the company&#x27;s feature films. Following his departure, he co-founded DreamWorks SKG in 1994, where he served as the company&#x27;s chief executive officer (CEO) and executive producer of its animated franchises—including &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, and &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;—until stepping down from the title in 2016. He has since founded the venture capital firm WndrCo in 2017, which invests in digital media projects, and launched Quibi in 2020, a defunct short-form mobile video platform that lost US$1.35 billion in seven months.

Katzenberg has also been involved in politics as an election donor. With active support of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, he was named &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s premier political kingmakers and one of the Democratic Party&#x27;s top national fund-raisers&quot;. He served as a campaign co-chair for Joe Biden&#x27;s 2024 presidential re-election campaign, and subsequently Kamala Harris&#x27; 2024 presidential campaign.

== Early life and education ==
Katzenberg was born on December 21, 1950, in New York City, to a Jewish family, the son of Anne, an artist, and Walter Katzenberg, a stockbroker. He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, graduating in 1969. When he was 14, Katzenberg volunteered to work on John Lindsay&#x27;s successful New York mayoral campaign. He quickly received the nickname &quot;Squirt&quot; and attended as many meetings as he could. He went on to attend New York University for one year, before dropping out to work full-time as an advance man for Lindsay.

== Professional career ==
=== Paramount Pictures ===
Katzenberg began his career as an assistant to producer David V. Picker, then in 1974 he became an assistant to Barry Diller, the chairman of Paramount Pictures. Diller moved Katzenberg to the marketing department, followed by other assignments within the studio, until he was assigned to revive the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, which resulted in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. He continued to work his way up and became president of production under Paramount&#x27;s president, Michael Eisner, overseeing the production of films including &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;.

=== The Walt Disney Studios ===
In 1984, Eisner became chief executive officer (CEO) of The Walt Disney Company. Eisner brought Katzenberg with him to serve as chairman of The Walt Disney Studios. As head of the studio, he oversaw all filmed content including motion pictures, television, Disney Channel, and home video distribution. Katzenberg was responsible for reviving the studio which, at the time, ranked last at the box office among the major studios. He focused the studio on the production of adult-oriented comedies through its Touchstone Pictures banner, including films such as &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;, &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. By 1987, Disney had become the number-one studio at the box office. Katzenberg expanded Disney&#x27;s film portfolio by launching Hollywood Pictures with Eisner and overseeing the acquisition of Miramax Films in 1993. Katzenberg also oversaw Touchstone Television, which produced television series such as &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Empty Nest&quot; and &quot;Home Improvement&quot;.

Katzenberg was also charged with turning around Disney&#x27;s ailing Feature Animation unit, creating some intrastudio controversy when he personally edited a few minutes out of a completed Disney animated feature, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985), shortly after joining the company. Under his management, the animation department eventually began creating some of Disney&#x27;s most critically acclaimed and highest grossing animated features. These films include &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991)—which was the first animated feature to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture—&quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995). Katzenberg also brokered a deal with Pixar to produce 3D computer-generated animated movies and greenlit production of &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

Concerns arose internally at Disney, particularly from Eisner and Roy E. Disney, about Katzenberg taking too much credit for the success of Disney&#x27;s animated releases. In 1993, Katzenberg discussed with Eisner the possibility of being promoted to president of the company, which would mean moving Frank Wells from president to vice chairman. Eisner responded that Wells would feel &quot;hurt&quot; in that scenario and then, according to Katzenberg, assured him that he would get the job if Wells vacated the position. After Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Eisner assumed his duties instead of promoting Katzenberg. In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Eisner said that Roy Disney, Walt Disney&#x27;s nephew and an influential member of the Disney board, did not like Katzenberg and threatened to start a proxy fight if Katzenberg was promoted to president. Tensions between Katzenberg, Eisner and Disney resulted in Katzenberg leaving Disney upon conclusion of his work contract with the company in October 1994. Disney board member Stanley Gold said Katzenberg had been brought low by &quot;his ego and almost pathological need to be important&quot;. Katzenberg sued Disney for money he asserted he was owed, and settled out of court for an estimated $250 million in 1999.

=== DreamWorks SKG ===

Later in 1994, Katzenberg co-founded DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, with Katzenberg taking primary responsibility for animation operations. He was also credited as producer or executive producer on the DreamWorks animated films &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;, &quot;Chicken Run&quot; and &quot;&quot; (all in 2000), &quot;Shrek&quot; in 2001, &quot;&quot; in 2002, &quot;&quot; in 2003 and both &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and &quot;Shark Tale&quot; in 2004.

After DreamWorks Animation suffered a $125 million loss on the traditionally animated &quot;&quot; (2003), Katzenberg believed that telling traditional stories using traditional animation was a thing of the past, and the studio switched to all computer-generated animation, though some of their films would have some small 2D animated sequences. Since then, most of DreamWorks&#x27; animated feature films have been successful financially and critically with several Annie Awards and Academy Awards nominations and wins.

=== DreamWorks Animation ===
In 2004, DreamWorks Animation (DWA) was spun off from DreamWorks as a separate company headed by Katzenberg. DWA held an initial public offering that same year in conjunction with the spinoff which raised more than $812 million.

The live-action DreamWorks movie studio was sold to Viacom in December 2005. Then in 2008, DreamWorks entered into a new agreement to begin distributing its live-action films through Universal Studios in 2009.

In 2006, Katzenberg made an appearance on the fifth season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. He awarded the task winners an opportunity to be character voices in &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;.

Katzenberg has been an industry leader in promoting digital 3D production of film, calling it &quot;the greatest advance in the film industry since the arrival of color in the 1930s.&quot; When Katzenberg appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on April 20, 2010, he confirmed that from now on &quot;every single movie&quot; that DreamWorks Animation produced would be in 3D and gave Stephen Colbert a pair of new 3D glasses.

NBCUniversal acquired DWA in 2016 for $3.8 billion. Katzenberg left his position as CEO of DWA and was named chairman of DreamWorks New Media (DWN), consisting of DWA&#x27;s interests in AwesomenessTV and Nova. By January 2017, Katzenberg had stepped down from his position with DWN.

=== WndrCo ===
In January 2017, the &quot;LA Times&quot; reported that Katzenberg had raised funds for a new media and technology investment firm called WndrCo.

=== Quibi ===
In late 2018, Katzenberg announced his new video streaming platform, Quibi, created in partnership with former eBay CEO Meg Whitman. The platform specialized in original, short-form content designed for smartphones. Whitman was hired as the company&#x27;s CEO and first employee. Katzenberg and Whitman created Quibi as a mobile-based Netflix. Their investors included Disney, NBCUniversal, Sony, Viacom, and AT&amp;T&#x27;s newly rebranded WarnerMedia.

In late 2020, Quibi shut down after just over six months of operation. Katzenberg said the shutdown was due to a sudden change in how audiences consume media caused by the coronavirus pandemic which did not align with Quibi&#x27;s market niche as well as a desire to return some funds to investors. Of the initial $1.65 billion raised, Katzenberg said he was able to return $600 million to investors. To lift Quibi employees&#x27; spirits, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Katzenberg told them to listen to &quot;Get Back Up Again&quot; from the movie &quot;Trolls&quot; during a video call announcing the company&#x27;s closure.

== Political activities ==

Katzenberg has been a prominent supporter of Democratic candidates for elected office since the Clinton administration and was an early supporter of Barack Obama. Reportedly &quot;smitten&quot; by Obama&#x27;s speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Katzenberg pledged his full support to Obama in 2006 if he decided to run for president. During his campaign, Obama praised Katzenberg for his &quot;tenacious support and advocacy since we started back in 2007.&quot; 

Katzenberg was an avid fundraiser for Obama, doing so while much of Hollywood was still supporting the Clintons. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported his efforts allowed Katzenberg to become an &quot;informal liaison&quot; between Hollywood and the Obama administration. Katzenberg was reportedly Obama&#x27;s top &quot;bundler&quot;, and, with Andy Spahn, had collected at least $6.6 million in combined donations for both of Obama&#x27;s presidential campaigns. In 2012, Katzenberg organized a fundraiser for Obama&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign at the residence of George Clooney. The event reportedly set a record for presidential fundraisers, garnering approximately $15 million. Some Obama campaign officials were unhappy with some of Katzenberg&#x27;s requests, including that Obama stay and talk with guests at each of the 14 tables at the dinner.

In 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly opened an investigation into DreamWorks and other movie studios for bribing foreign officials. It was opened after the announcements of a deal between China and the United States to increase the number of American movies released in China and the launch of Oriental DreamWorks, a Chinese offshoot of DreamWorks Animation. News of the investigation broke shortly after Katzenberg assisted Joe Biden with brokering the Chinese movie deal and Katzenberg had held a fundraiser for the Obama campaign. The timing of the events led &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Jennifer Rubin to question if the deal and fundraiser were related. Katzenberg denied the existence of the investigation, saying that DreamWorks had never been asked for documents or to otherwise cooperate with an investigation. 

In October 2012, Obama and Bill Clinton reportedly visited Katzenberg at his home in Beverly Hills for a private meeting with wealthy Democratic donors. The Obama campaign said the meeting was to thank supporters, but some members of the campaign finance committee said that it involved the pro-Obama political action committee Priorities USA Action. Members of the White House press corps who had traveled to California with Obama were kept in the garage of Katzenberg&#x27;s mansion and one reporter called the meeting &quot;unusual&quot;. Katzenberg, who had previously donated $2 million to Priorities USA Action, donated an additional $1 million to the PAC that month. Kaztzenberg donated $1 million to Priorities USA Action in 2015, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. In October 2016, he hosted a $100,000-per-person fundraiser at his Beverly Hills residence with Obama as the main attraction.

In 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Katzenberg pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives gun-control demonstration.

Katzenberg donated approximately $1.8 million to a PAC supporting Karen Bass&#x27;s Los Angeles mayoral bid in 2022.

In 2023, Katzenberg was named as one of the national co-chairs of Joe Biden&#x27;s 2024 campaign for reelection as president. Katzenberg noted he would provide significant financial support for Biden&#x27;s re-election. In December 2023, Katzenberg hosted a fundraiser and, at the time, dismissed concerns about Biden&#x27;s age, instead referring to it as &quot;his superpower&quot;.

In 2024, Katzenberg was an advisor to and co-chair of the Biden reelection campaign. After Biden dropped out of the race, Katzenberg became co-chair of Kamala Harris&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign.

=== SOPA/PIPA ===
When the White House announced its opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in January 2012, Chris Dodd, the former Senator and head of the Motion Picture Association of America, the film industry&#x27;s lobbying organization, contacted Katzenberg to obtain more information about the president&#x27;s plans. When Dodd reportedly asked him to intervene, Katzenberg declined, but &quot;sought to soothe hurt feelings and lay the groundwork for a deal more friendly to Hollywood&quot;. Katzenberg&#x27;s office contacted Obama and urged him to contact other studio chiefs in order to reaffirm their support. Obama would take the advice, making Katzenberg one of the few Hollywood executives working on brokering a compromise with Silicon Valley.

== Recognition ==
Katzenberg was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts degree by Ringling College of Art and Design in 2008, the first in the school&#x27;s history.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Katzenberg with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2012, in acknowledgment of his role in &quot;raising money for education, art and health-related causes, particularly those benefiting the motion picture industry&quot;. The following year, Katzenberg was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Obama.

At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Katzenberg was awarded an honorary Palme d&#x27;Or, the festival&#x27;s highest prize. Cannes director Thierry Frémaux credited Katzenberg and &quot;Shrek&quot; with expanding the range of films considered at the competition. Katzenberg compared the distinction to the earlier Academy recognition.

== Personal life ==

Katzenberg married Marilyn Siegel, a kindergarten teacher, in 1975. They have twin children, Laura and David, born in 1983. David is a television producer and director.

Katzenberg and his wife have been highly active in charitable causes. They donated the multimillion-dollar Katzenberg Center to Boston University&#x27;s College of General Studies, citing that the school gave their two children the &quot;love of education&quot;. They also donated the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for Animation at the University of Southern California.

Katzenberg sits on the board of directors of multiple organizations, including the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund, Geffen Playhouse, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, AIDS Project Los Angeles, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, California Institute of the Arts, Simon Wiesenthal Center, and the USC School of Cinematic Arts. In 2008, Katzenberg founded the DreamWorks Animation Academy in partnership with Inner-City Arts, a Los Angeles-based art education nonprofit organization, to provide inner-city students with instruction in digital media production.

In January 2025, Katzenberg and his wife donated $5 million to the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund for relief efforts regarding the Southern California wildfires.

Katzenberg had an estimated worth of $900 million in 2016.

<text>Ronald Timothy Renton, Baron Renton of Mount Harry, (28 May 1932 – 25 August 2020) was a British Conservative Party politician.

==Early life==
Tim Renton, who rarely used his first name of Ronald, was born in London. He attended Sunningdale School and then Eton, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar. He was an undergraduate at Magdalen College, Oxford on the Roberts Gawen scholarship, and earned a first-class degree in History.

==Parliamentary career==
After unsuccessfully contesting Sheffield Park in 1970, he was Conservative Member of Parliament for Mid-Sussex from 1974 to 1997.

He served as a Minister of State in both the Foreign Office and the Home Office, and served as Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Chief Whip (Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury) between 1989 and 1990. Following Thatcher&#x27;s resignation in 1990 he served in John Major&#x27;s government as Minister for the Arts between 1990 and 1992. During this time, he came up with the idea of a National Lottery. This was later adopted as a government policy. He launched National Music Day (UK) with Mick Jagger which ran from 1992 until around 1997. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Geoffrey Howe and to John Biffen, the Trade Secretary but resigned from that position in 1981 after he refused to support the government on a vote about a retrospective windfall tax on bank profits.

After standing down from the Commons at the 1997 General Election, he was created a life peer in the 1997 Dissolution Honours; on 9 June 1997 as Baron Renton of Mount Harry, of Offham in the County of East Sussex, and took his seat in the House of Lords. He retired from the House on 14 April 2016.

==Personal life==
In 1960, he married Alice Blanche Helen Fergusson, daughter of Sir James Fergusson, 8th Baronet of Kilkerran. The couple lived in Offham near Lewes in East Sussex and had a holiday home on the Hebridean island of Tiree.

Their four surviving children are Alex Renton, a journalist and author, Christian Louise, Daniel Charles Antony, an environmentalist, and (Katherine) Chelsea, who is an artist and author. The couple&#x27;s youngest daughter, Polly Renton (Penelope Sally Rosita), a documentary film maker, died in a car accident in 2010.

Renton died from cancer at his home in Offham on 25 August 2020, aged 88.

<text>Elaioplasts are one of the three possible forms of leucoplasts, sometimes broadly referred to as such. The main function of elaioplasts is synthesis and storage of fatty acids, terpenes, and other lipids, and they can be found in the embryonic leaves of certain plants, as well as the anthers of many flowering plants.

== Description ==
Like most leucoplasts, elaioplasts are non-pigmented organelles capable of alternating between the different forms of plastids. The elaioplast specifically is primarily responsible for the storage and metabolism of lipids, among these roles, recent studies have shown that these organelles participate in the formation of terpenes and fatty acids. Typically, they appear as small, rounded organelles filled by oil droplets. Lipids found inside elaioplasts mirror those synthesized by prokaryotes, chiefly triacylglycerol and sterol esters, which cluster into the droplets visible by microscope. As for their other components, elaioplasts also contain plastoglobuli associated proteins such as fibrillins, a protein family believed to be retained from the cyanobacterial ancestors of plastids. Alongside the tapetosomes (clusters of oil and proteins produced by the endoplasmic reticulum), elaioplasts are frequently found in the tapetum of angiosperm anthers, where their products, oil from the plastid and protein from the tapetosome, are used to form the pollen coat of developing grains. Following the maturation of pollen grains, these organelles are degraded and released into the anther loculus. Found also in oilseeds, elaioplasts in this group provide lipids to be converted into carbohydrates which will serve as fuel in the embryo&#x27;s germination. Citrus specimens have been shown to have especially high amounts of elaioplasts in their fruit peels, where they are essential to the production of terpenes.

== Development ==
Within the plant, elaioplasts, as well as all other plastids, arise from proplastids in the dividing portion of the stem (meristem). These proplastids have not yet differentiated and, as such, can develop into any variety of known plastids, determined by the tissues they are present in. In vegetative cells, proplastids usually follow a unidirectional pathway of development with no reversals between one form and the next. Reproductive cells, however, may have plastids that inter-convert frequently. In the anthers of flowering plants, elaioplasts represent the final stage of plastid development within the tapetum, either emerging directly from proplastids or the conversion of other plastids, depending on the species and pollination strategy.

== Origin and inheritance ==
Plastids are hypothesized to have originated with an endosymbiotic event between an ancient eukaryote and cyanobacterial ancestor more than 1 billion years ago, where the bacteria was engulfed by the other and retained where it served as the metabolic center for photosynthesis. Evidence of this can be observed today in the independent genomes characteristic of plastids, found to be closely related to modern cyanobacteria. Since their ancient symbiotic event, the plastid genome has been reduced significantly, with the organelles themselves coding for around 100 of the 2500 associated proteins, everything else being transferred to the nuclear genome.

Like most plastids, elaioplasts reproduce through binary fission independent from the division of the parent cell, a feature indicative of their bacterial ancestry. This fission occurs just before cytokinesis, with the products then being transported to the daughter cells as a component of the cytoplasm.

As a result of the ability to inter-convert between other types of the plastid family, elaioplasts share the same plastome(plastid genome) with all other plastids and are predominately inherited maternally in angiosperms. As its name implies, maternal inheritance excludes the plastome of the father through one of two ways: during pollen development or in pollen tube formation. During pollen development, paternal plastids are halted by microfilaments in the cytoskeleton just prior to microspore division or degeneration just after. Paternal plastome contribution can also be prevented during pollen tube formation, where the plastids are separated from sperm cells as they fuse with the egg.

<doc id="576191" wikidata="Q1365399" url="?curid=576191" title="Paideia">
<text>Paideia (; also spelled paedeia; ) referred to the rearing and education of the ideal member of the ancient Greek polis or state. These educational ideals later spread to the Greco-Roman world at large, and were called &quot;humanitas&quot; in Latin. 

Paideia was meant to instill aristocratic virtues in the young citizen men who were trained in this way. An ideal man within the polis would be well-rounded, refined in intellect, morals, and physicality, so training of the body, mind, and soul was important. Both practical, subject-based schooling as well as a focus upon the socialization of individuals within the aristocratic order of the polis were a part of this training. 

The practical aspects of paideia included subjects within the modern designation of the liberal arts (e.g. rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, and philosophy), as well as scientific disciplines like medicine. Gymnastics and wrestling were valued for their effect on the body alongside the moral education which was imparted by the study of music, poetry, and philosophy. 

This approach to the rearing of a well-rounded Greek male was common to the Greek-speaking world, with the exception of Sparta, where &quot;agoge&quot; was practiced.

==The idea of paideia in ancient and modern cultures==
The Greeks considered paideia to be carried out by the aristocratic class, who tended to intellectualize their culture and their ideas. The culture and the youth were formed to the ideal of &quot;kalos kagathos&quot; (&quot;beautiful and good&quot;).

Aristotle gives his paideia proposal in Book VIII of the &quot;Politics&quot;. In this, he says that, &quot;education ought to be adapted to the particular form of constitution, since the particular character belonging to each constitution both guards the constitution generally and originally establishes it...&quot; As a result, Aristotle argues that education should be a public system, not left up to individuals. He goes on to deliberate about what a proper education should entail, weighing different subjects, such as music and drawing, against their benefit towards cultivating virtue. He lists the ways he believes that gymnastic training should be carried out, bringing up some Spartan practices in order to see the benefits and drawbacks of their system. He talks extensively about music and its place in education, ultimately concluding that it should be included, but that there should be specific instruction, &quot;in what times and what rhythms they should take part, and also what kinds of instruments should be used in their studies, as this naturally makes a difference.&quot;
The German-American classicist Werner Jaeger used the concept of paideia to trace the development of Greek thought and education from Homer to Demosthenes in &quot;Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture&quot;, Aristotelian philosopher Mortimer Adler gives a paideia proposal in his criticism of contemporary Western educational systems.

==Isocrates&#x27; influence==
Isocrates&quot;&quot;&#x27; paideia was quite influential, particularly in Athens&quot;.&quot; Its goal was to construct a practice of education and politics that brought validity in the democratic deliberative practice while remaining intellectually respectable. Isocrates sought to encourage a love of wisdom in his audience by making them apply principles of intellectual consistency to their lives. The fundamental aspect of his paideia was consistency on the individual, civic, and panhellenic levels.

* &quot;Hard is the Good.&quot;

<doc id="576193" wikidata="Q1363734" url="?curid=576193" title="Squat toilet">
<text>A squat toilet (or squatting toilet) is a toilet used by squatting, rather than sitting. This means that the posture for defecation and for female urination is to place one foot on each side of the toilet drain or hole and to squat over it. There are several types of squat toilets, but they all consist essentially of a toilet pan or bowl at floor level. Such a toilet pan is also called a &quot;squatting pan&quot;. A squat toilet may use a water seal and therefore be a flush toilet, or it can be without a water seal and therefore be a dry toilet. The term &quot;squat&quot; refers only to the expected defecation posture and not any other aspects of toilet technology, such as whether it is water flushed or not. 

Squat toilets are used all over the world, but are particularly common in some Asian and African nations, as well as in some Muslim countries. In many of those countries, anal cleansing with water is also the cultural norm and easier to perform than with toilets used in a sitting position. They are also occasionally found in some European and South American countries. 

Squat toilets are regarded as traditional by many. In 1976, squatting toilets were said to be used by the majority of the world&#x27;s population. However, there is a general trend in many countries to move from squatting toilets to sitting toilets (particularly in urban areas) as the latter are often regarded as more modern.

== Design ==

Squat toilets are arranged at floor level, which requires the individual to squat with bent knees. In contrast to a pedestal or a sitting toilet, the opening of the drain pipe is located at the ground level.

Squatting slabs can be made of porcelain (ceramic), stainless steel, fibreglass, or in the case of low-cost versions in developing countries, with concrete, ferrocement, plastic, or wood covered with linoleum. Slabs can also be made of wood (timber), but need to be treated with preservatives, such as paint or linoleum, to prevent rotting and to enable thorough cleaning of the squatting slab.

There are two design variations: one where the toilet is level with the ground, and the other where it is raised on a platform approximately 30 cm (1 ft). The latter is easier to use for people who urinate while standing, but both types can be used for this purpose. There is also no difference for defecation or squatting urination.

== Use ==

The user stands over the squat toilet facing the hood and pulls down (up in the case of skirts or dress) their trousers and underwear to the knees. The user then squats over the hole, as close to the front as possible, as excrement tends to fall onto the rear edge of the in-floor receptacle if the user squats too far back.

== Health, hygiene and maintenance==

The standing surface of the squatting pan should be kept clean and dry in order to prevent disease transmission and to limit odors.

Squat toilets are usually easier to clean than sitting toilets (pedestals), except that one has to bend down further if the squatting pan needs manual scrubbing. Squat toilets are properly cleaned using a mop in combination with a detergent solution.

===Health effects===

The squatting defecation posture is more physiological, ideal and relaxed. This is because it allows for better relaxation of the puborectalis muscle and hence straightening of the anorectal angle, and for faster, easier and more complete evacuation of stool. The squatting position therefore prevents excessive straining, and hence protects against stretching of the nerves, such as the pudendal nerve. Damage of these nerves can lead to permanent problems with urinary, defecation and sexual function. The squatting position also increases intra-abdominal pressure. The squatting position is often recommended as part of a range of measures to manage constipation and its sub-types, including obstructed defecation syndrome and dyssynergic defecation. Chronic, excessive straining during defecation, which is more likely to be needed in the sitting position, may be associated with the development of inflamed hemorrhoids or any of the spectrum of pelvic organ prolapse disorders, such as rectocele, rectal prolapse, etc.

However, according to some sources, excessive straining in the squatting position while defecating may increase the risk of severe hemorrhoids, or increase the tendency of prolapse of hemorrhoids, because of increased perineal descent and intra-abdominal pressure. Prolonged and repeated straining on a sitting toilet has the same effect.

== Society and culture ==

=== Perceptions and trends ===
There are two different attitudes towards squat toilets, largely dependent on what users are used to, or whether the toilet is at a public or private place:
Some people regard squat toilets as more hygienic compared to sitting toilets. They might be easier to clean and there is no skin contact with the surface of the toilet seat. For that reason, some people perceive them as more hygienic, particularly for public toilets.

Some people regard sitting toilets as &quot;more modern&quot; than squat toilets. Sitting toilets have a lower risk of soiling clothing or shoes, as urine is less likely to splash on bottom parts of trousers or shoes. Furthermore, sitting toilets are more convenient for people with disabilities and the elderly.

A trend towards more sitting toilets in countries that were traditionally using squat toilets can be observed in some urban and more affluent areas, in areas with new buildings (as well as hotels and airports) or in tourist regions.

=== Public toilets ===

Squat toilets are used in public toilets, rather than household toilets, because they are perceived by some as easier to clean and more hygienic, therefore potentially more appropriate for general public use. For instance, this is the case in parts of France, Italy, Greece, or the Balkans, where such toilets are somewhat common in public toilets (restrooms).

=== Preferences by country or region ===

The following general statements can be made:
* Squat toilets are common in many Asian countries, including China and India. They are also widespread in Turkey (), Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Myanmar, The Philippines, Iran and Iraq. They can be found in nations like Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and Singapore.
* People in sub-Saharan African countries, especially in rural areas, widely use squat toilets, for example in Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda. Squat toilets are not common in South Africa.
*Much of the world&#x27;s population use squat toilets, especially in rural areas of developing countries.
* Countries in the Middle East and North Africa often have both types of toilets, i.e. sitting and squatting.
* In Hindu or Muslim cultures, the prevalence of squat toilets is generally quite high, as is the practice of anal cleansing with water.
* In Latin and South America, flush toilets are always of the sitting type, whereas dry toilets may be either of the sitting or a squatting type. The occurrence of squat toilets in urban areas of Latin America appears to be rather low.
*Squat toilets are rare in Australia, New Zealand, United States, Canada, and countries in Northern and Western Europe (except public toilets in France). Where they do exist, they have usually been installed to accommodate visitors, tourists, students, or recent migrants from places that use squatting toilets traditionally.

==== Europe ====

In Southern and Eastern Europe including parts of France, in Turkey, Greece, Italy, Albania, Balkans, and Russia they are common, especially in public toilets. Squat pit latrine toilets are still present in many areas of Russia.

Squat toilets are generally non-existent in Northern and Western Europe. France and Italy are an exception and have some squat toilets remaining in old buildings and public toilets because they used to be the norm there in the early 20th century. In BMW Welt in Munich, the public restrooms have some stalls with squat toilets. There are also a few squat toilets at Stuttgart Airport.

==== China ====
Many areas in China have traditional squat toilets instead of sitting toilets, especially in public toilets. Nevertheless, sitting toilets have increasingly become the norm in major urban areas and cities. Sitting toilets are on the one hand associated with development and modernization, and on the other hand with reduced hygiene and possible transmission of diseases.

==== Japan ====

Although in Japan it is believed that the squat toilet is traditional, the trend in Japan is to move away from squat toilets: According to Toto, one of Japan&#x27;s major toilet manufacturers, the production of Western-style toilets increased rapidly since 1976. In 2015, only 1% of all toilets produced by this company were squat toilets.

Since the 1960s, the trend has been to replace squat toilets at schools and public places with sitting toilets. This trend was thought to accelerate in the run-up to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Since the 1980s, high-tech sitting toilets are emerging that replace traditional squat toilets, especially in urban areas. However, many rural people have no experience with such high-tech toilets and need detailed instructions. High-tech sitting toilets have also become commonplace in South Korea.

<text>WOR (710 AM) is a 50,000-watt class A clear-channel AM radio station owned by iHeartMedia and licensed to New York, New York. The station airs a mix of local and syndicated talk radio shows, primarily from co-owned Premiere Networks, including &quot;The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show&quot;, &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot;, and &quot;Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&quot;. &quot;CBS Eye on the World&quot; with John Batchelor, from CBS Audio Network is heard at night. Since 2016, the station has served as the New York outlet for co-owned NBC News Radio. The station&#x27;s studios are located at 125 West 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan, with its transmitter in Rutherford, New Jersey. WOR began broadcasting on Wednesday, February 22, 1922, and is one of the oldest continuously operating radio stations in the United States with a three–letter call sign, characteristic of a station dating from the 1920s. WOR is the only New York City station to have retained its original three-letter call sign, making those the oldest continuously used call letters in the New York City area.

==History==

===Bamberger&#x27;s Department Store===
WOR&#x27;s original owner was Bamberger&#x27;s Department Store in Newark, New Jersey. In the early 1920s the store was selling radio receivers and wanted to put a radio station on the air to help promote receiver sales, as well as for general publicity. Effective December 1, 1921, the U.S. Department of Commerce set aside a single wavelength, 360 meters (833 kilohertz), for radio stations to broadcast &quot;entertainment&quot; programs. The store applied for a license which was granted on February 20, 1922, with the randomly assigned call sign of WOR. The station&#x27;s original city of license was Newark.

The station made its debut broadcast on February 22, 1922, from a studio located on an upper floor of the store. A 250-watt De Forest transmitter was constructed on the roof of the department store. The station&#x27;s first broadcast was made with a homemade microphone constructed by attaching a megaphone to a telephone mouthpiece. Al Jolson&#x27;s &quot;April Showers&quot; was the first record played on WOR.

===750 to 710 kHz===
Three other broadcasting stations were already on the air in the region transmitting on 360 meters: WJZ, also in Newark, operated by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA); WNO, operated by &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot; newspaper in Jersey City; and WDT, owned by the Ship Owners Radio Service in the Stapleton section of Staten Island. The use of the common wavelength required a time-sharing agreement between the stations designating transmitting hours. This soon became complicated, for by June a total of ten regional stations were using 360 meters. This restricted the number of hours available to WOR, which was now limited to just a few hours per week.

In September 1922 the Department of Commerce set aside a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz), for &quot;Class B&quot; stations that had quality equipment and programming. In the New York City region, WOR, along with two New York City American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) stations, WBAY and WEAF (now WFAN), were assigned to this new wavelength. Additional &quot;Class B&quot; broadcasting frequencies were announced in May 1923, including three for the Newark/New York City area.

WOR moved to 740 kHz, where it shared time with WDT (which shut down by the end of the year) and a new RCA station, WJY. WJY rarely used the time periods assigned to it, and by the summer of 1926, WOR began operating full-time, stating that the silent WJY was considered to have forfeited its hours. In June 1927, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) moved WOR to 710 kHz, which it has occupied ever since. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC&#x27;s General Order 40, this assignment was designated a &quot;clear channel&quot; frequency, with WOR the dominant station.

===Manhattan studios and Mutual Broadcasting===
In December 1924, although still licensed to Newark, WOR opened a second studio in Manhattan to originate programs, so that stars of the day based in New York City would have better access to the station. Later in 1926, WOR left its original New York City studio on the 9th floor of Chickering Hall at 27 West 57th Street. It relocated to 1440 Broadway, two blocks from Times Square.

WOR was a charter member of the CBS Radio Network (CBS), acting as the flagship of the 16 stations that aired the first Columbia Broadcasting System network program on September 18, 1927.

In 1934, WOR in partnership with Chicago radio station WGN, and Cincinnati radio station WLW, formed the Mutual Broadcasting System and became its New York City flagship station. Mutual was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; national radio networks in the United States during the 1930s–1980s.

In 1941, the station changed its city of license from Newark to New York City.

In 1957, WOR ended its relationship with Mutual and became an independent station. However, the station continued to carry Mutual&#x27;s &quot;Top of the News&quot; with Fulton Lewis for 15 minutes each evening, Monday–Friday at 7:00 p.m. for several more years.

On April 30, 2005, WOR moved from its offices and studios at 1440 Broadway in Midtown Manhattan, where it had been based for 79 years. It relocated to a new facility at 111 Broadway near Wall Street in the Financial District.

After the station was acquired by Clear Channel Communications in 2012, it moved to its current location at Clear Channel&#x27;s studios on Avenue of The Americas in Tribeca.

===FM and TV stations===
In 1941, WOR put an FM radio station, W71NY, on the air. WOR had been experimenting with FM broadcasts as W2XWI from its Carteret, New Jersey, transmitter site from 1938. For most of its first two decades, W71NY, later WOR-FM, largely simulcast the same programming as WOR. In 1949, WOR signed on a sister television station, Channel 9 WOR-TV. It started as an independent station, showing mostly movies and reruns of network shows, with some local children&#x27;s and talk programs.

In 1952, WOR-AM-FM-TV were sold to RKO General. The TV station later became WWOR-TV, relocated to Secaucus, New Jersey, after it and the radio stations, 710 WOR and 98.7 WOR-FM, were sold to separate companies in 1987 (due to an FCC regulation in effect then that forbade TV and radio stations with different owners from sharing the same call letters). WOR-FM today is WEPN-FM.

===Full service radio to talk===
From the 1930s to the early 1980s, WOR was described as a full service radio station, featuring a mix of music, talk and news. There was an emphasis on news reports and talk programs, but music was played as well, usually a blend of pop standards and adult contemporary tunes, often described as middle of the road music (MOR). WOR played several songs per hour weekday mornings from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and again afternoons from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. WOR also featured music on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

In ratings reports, WOR was classified as an &quot;MOR/Talk&quot; station until 1984. From 1983 to about 1985, WOR gradually eliminated music altogether, evolving into its current talk format.

===Noted hosts===
Past notable hosts include Ed and Pegeen Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Long John Nebel, Peter Lind Hayes and Mary Healy, Bernard Meltzer, Barry Farber, Jean Shepherd, Bob and Ray, Bob Grant and Gene Klavan. From April 15, 1945, to March 21, 1963, newspaper columnist Dorothy Kilgallen and her husband Dick Kollmar co-hosted a late morning show on WOR called &quot;Breakfast With Dorothy and Dick&quot;.

WOR&#x27;s morning show &quot;Rambling with Gambling&quot; aired every weekday morning on the station, from March 1925 to September 2000, across three generations of hosts: John B. Gambling, his son John A. Gambling, and his grandson John R. Gambling. After John R. Gambling&#x27;s edition of the show was dropped, he moved to 770 WABC, where he hosted a late-morning show until January 2008. He returned to WOR mornings in May 2008. Although never aimed at young listeners, WOR was this group&#x27;s radio station of record in the New York metropolitan area during bad winter weather. Students of all ages dialed up 710 AM on their radios as the Gamblings dutifully announced a comprehensive list of school closings for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, in strict alphabetical order. John R. Gambling later hosted middays on 970 WNYM for several years, after retiring from WOR in December 2013.

===News department===
For many years the station aired detailed, 15-minute news reports on the hour. Newscasters Henry Gladstone, Harry Hennessey, Jack Allen, John Wingate, Lyle Vann, Peter Roberts, Ed Walsh, Shelly Strickler, Sam Hall and Roger Skibenes were some of the on-air members of the news department. WOR introduced live, on-air, helicopter traffic reports with pilot-reporters &quot;Fearless&quot; Fred Feldman and George Meade. On January 10, 1969, fill-in pilot/reporter Frank McDermott died when the WOR helicopter crashed into an apartment building in Astoria, Queens as he was broadcasting a traffic update. The building caught fire and McDermott&#x27;s body was found nearby.

Beginning in October 2011, WOR extended its partnership with NBC News beyond hourly national news updates to include live simulcasts of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;.

===New Jersey transmitters===
Beginning in 1935, WOR&#x27;s transmitter was in Carteret, New Jersey. The site used two steel lattice towers and a steel cable as a third radiating element. The cable hung from a catenary connected to the top of each of the towers. This created a lopsided figure-8 pattern intended to cover both the New York City and Philadelphia markets, making WOR the first 50,000 watt directional station in the U.S. Over the years, construction affected WOR&#x27;s signal strength and WOR sought a new location. Circa 1966, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a construction permit for a new location in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. That location features three full half-wave (692 feet) guyed antennas in a triangular array. WOR was within one mile of both AM 1190 WLIB and AM 1010 WINS. Thus each WOR tower hosted AM detuning apparatus to prevent adverse distortion of WINS and WLIB radiation patterns. Built on hydraulic landfill, the site provides excellent ground conductivity for daytime groundwave radiation.

At night when conditions are favorable, WOR could be picked up, using very sensitive radio receivers, in parts of Europe and Africa. It shares Class A status on 710 kHz with KIRO in Seattle. WOR and KIRO must protect each other against interference by using directional antennas. On September 8, 2006, WOR moved its transmitter a short distance to Rutherford, New Jersey, near the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike.

===Clear Channel Communications===
On August 13, 2012, it was announced that WOR was to be purchased by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), pending FCC approval. A local marketing agreement began on August 15, 2012. On December 20, 2012, the day Clear Channel officially took ownership of the station, &quot;The Dr. Joy Browne Show&quot;, &quot;The Gov. David Paterson Show&quot;, and &quot;The Mike Huckabee Show&quot; were removed from the WOR program schedule.

===Adding new shows===

On January 2, 2013, WOR added former WABC weekend host Mark Simone to its weekday morning line up. WOR offers ten hours of live and local programming on weekdays, with syndicated programs heard the rest of the day. Weekends feature mostly paid brokered programming on health, money, real estate and other topics.

In late 2014, after WOR cancelled the hot talk &quot;Elliot in the Morning&quot; show, simulcast from iHeart alternative rock station WWDC in Washington, D.C., former WNBC sportscaster Len Berman and Tampa Bay area radio host Todd Schnitt were hired as the station&#x27;s morning hosts. Schnitt left WOR in October 2017, while Berman continued with guest co-hosts in the 6:00a.m.–10:00a.m. slot. A new co-host, NY Post Broadway columnist, Michael Riedel, was added in 2018. Riedel had been a regular contributor to the &quot;Imus In the Morning&quot; show.

On January 1, 2014, both the Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity shows were transferred from rival talk radio station WABC, owned by Cumulus Media. Since Premiere Networks, owned by iHeartMedia, syndicates both shows, the shows were brought in-house to WOR to boost the station&#x27;s ratings and retain revenue. Limbaugh died in February 2021, and the show was succeeded by the duo of Clay Travis and Buck Sexton in June 2021.

===Mets baseball===
On November 4, 2013, WOR and the New York Mets announced the team&#x27;s games would be broadcast on 710 AM, as well as advertised on all local Clear Channel radio stations, beginning with the 2014 baseball season. To act as a lead-in to the Mets, sportscaster Pete McCarthy was given an early evening show called &quot;The Sports Zone&quot;.

The relationship with the Mets lasted through the 2018 season, after which the team announced a new seven-year agreement with Entercom to air games on WCBS 880. McCarthy&#x27;s show was also discontinued.

==WOR Radio Network==

WOR was once the flagship station of the now-defunct WOR Radio Network. The network distributed nationally syndicated programming, all from the WOR studios at 111 Broadway in New York. Following the sale of WOR to Clear Channel Communications, what was left of the WOR Radio Network was folded into Premiere Networks, Clear Channel&#x27;s syndication wing.

<text>Adventures in Babysitting (also known as A Night on the Town in certain countries) is a 1987 American teen comedy film written by David Simkins and directed by Chris Columbus in his directorial debut. It stars Elisabeth Shue, Keith Coogan, Anthony Rapp, and Maia Brewton, and features cameos by blues singer/guitarist Albert Collins and singer-songwriter Southside Johnny Lyon.

==Plot==
After her boyfriend Mike Todwell cancels their anniversary date, 17-year-old Chris Parker invites her friend Brenda over to her Oak Park, Illinois house to cheer her up, but is convinced by her mother to babysit their neighbors&#x27; daughter, eight-year-old Sara Anderson, while the parents attend a party in downtown Chicago. Sara&#x27;s 15-year-old brother Brad is supposed to spend the night at his friend Daryl Coopersmith&#x27;s house, but changes his plans to be with Chris. After receiving a frantic call from Brenda, who ran away to a downtown bus station, Chris plans to pick her up, but is coerced by Brad, Sara, and Daryl to take them with her. On the freeway, their station wagon suffers a flat tire and they are picked up by a tow truck driver, &quot;Handsome&quot; John Pruitt, who offers to pay for the tire when Chris realizes that she left her purse at the Andersons&#x27;. En route, Pruitt receives a call from his boss Dawson with evidence that his wife is cheating on him. Pruitt rushes to his house to confront the infidelity; the car of Chris&#x27;s mother is damaged when he accidentally shoots out the windshield while aiming to kill his wife&#x27;s lover with a revolver. Chris and the kids hide in the adulterer&#x27;s Cadillac, which is then stolen by Joe Gipp, a car thief.

Reaching their hideout in the South Side, the kids realize that they have stumbled upon a multi-state stolen car operation, and Joe is chided by Graydon, the operation&#x27;s second-in-command, for bringing witnesses. They are detained in an upstairs office but escape. They enter a blues club where the band on stage refuses to let them leave until they perform a blues number. The group recounts their events while the band plays, causing the audience to sing along and applaud. They leave when Joe, Graydon, and their boss Bleak arrive in the club, whose owners stall them.

Brad comes clean about his feelings toward Chris and is disappointed to learn that he is too young for her. After separating Daryl from a prostitute who is a runaway, Chris is reminded of Brenda. They are found and chased again by Graydon and Bleak but escape on the Chicago &quot;L&quot; train and wind up in the middle of a gang fight. Brad is injured when one of the gang leaders throws a switchblade onto his foot. They take Brad to the university hospital, where he receives a stitch. They run into Pruitt, who is now on the run from his earlier attacks; he says that he replaced the windshield, but Dawson wants $50 for the tire. The kids come across a fraternity house party, and Chris becomes attracted to Dan Lynch, a gentleman who learns of her problem and donates $45. He takes them to Dawson&#x27;s Garage and drops them off.

When they find Dawson, his blond hair and sledgehammer lead Sara to believe that he is Thor. He denies them their car because of the $5 shortage, but when Sara offers him her toy Thor helmet, he changes his mind and lets them go. Meanwhile, Joe Gipp tells Bleak about their troubles; the three are waiting to follow them. The kids find the restaurant where Mike was supposed to take Chris and discover that he is with another girl. Sara slips away to look at a toy store while Chris confronts Mike. Brad stands up for Chris, but is reluctant to hit Mike, so Daryl kicks Mike into a table, ruining his dinner and causing a commotion. Bleak spots Sara, and Graydon chases her to an office building where she hides; the others note her disappearance and follow, accidentally coming across the Andersons&#x27; party. After Sara climbs out an open window and slides down the building, Chris spots her and they run upstairs to help.

After the group pulls Sara from outside the window, Bleak intervenes on them. Joe knocks his boss unconscious, before giving him a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine that Daryl had stolen, which contained important notes that the criminals wanted. The kids retrieve Brenda from the bus station and rush home, avoiding the Andersons on Interstate 290. Once home, Chris cleans up the mess left earlier, settling into place just as the Andersons enter. Just as Chris is leaving, Dan arrives with one of Sara&#x27;s missing skates. With Sara&#x27;s encouragement, Chris and Dan reconcile and kiss.

A post credits scene shows Bleak still waiting to be rescued from the side of the building.

==Production==
Writer David Simkins was working for New World Pictures when he read a copy of the script for &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Simkins said he wanted to do a teen film in the vein of that film and &quot;After Hours&quot;, a story which told the series of misadventures over a limited time period. He pitched the idea to New World who did not want to make it. Simkins wrote the script and sold it to Paramount. It was assigned to producers Lyda Obst and Debra Hill and Simkins credits them with being of great assistance on the script.

For his directorial debut, Columbus said he reviewed 100 scripts. He chose &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; because he felt comfortable with its scale. Paramount Pictures had a right of first refusal but demanded Molly Ringwald be cast in the lead. Touchstone Pictures agreed to make the film after The Walt Disney Company received $300 million in financing from Silver Screen Partners. Over 150 actresses auditioned for the lead role in Dallas, Florida, New York City, Toronto, Chicago, and Los Angeles, including Valerie Bertinelli. Columbus cast Elisabeth Shue, who was a student at Harvard University at the time.

Simkins says when the project was at Paramount they wanted Molly Ringwald who turned down the film. He says the studio then proposed Cher and Bette Midler as possible stars. He says when they saw Elisabeth Shue they knew she was the actress they wanted but they still saw a lot of alternatives before offering her the role.

Simkins says the idea of the singing scene at the Blues House came from Chris Columbus.

Principal photography began in Toronto on January 5, 1987. Many of the scenes shot there doubled for the film&#x27;s setting of Chicago. Production designer Todd Hallowell simulated Chicago streets by adding trash, and reconstructed two stories of the Associates Center skyscraper in the city for the film&#x27;s iconic shot of the characters dangling out of it. However, there would also be some location shots in Chicago at landmarks such as the Chicago &quot;L&quot;, Fitzgerald&#x27;s Nightclub, Lower Wacker Drive, the Chicago Expressway, Wolf Point. Some special effects shots also took place in Los Angeles. Ric Waite later confirmed that he shot the film using techniques similar to a drama rather than a comedy in order to highlight the film&#x27;s unpredictable tone.

==Release==
The film earned $34.4 million in the United States, which the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; attributed to a new ad campaign.

===Home media===
&quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; was the first Walt Disney movie to have a PG-13 rating.

The film has been released on VHS and Betamax, LaserDisc, DVD and Blu-ray formats. In the United States, it received a VHS release by Touchstone Home Video on July 14, 1988. It was released on DVD for the first time on January 18, 2000, by Touchstone Home Video. A 25th anniversary edition Blu-ray was released on August 7, 2012.

Although it may still be referred to as &quot;A Night on the Town&quot; on television airings in the United Kingdom, the film was released on rental VHS in the UK under its original title. The VHS was re-released on October 21, 2002, in the United Kingdom by Cinema Club and it received a 15 certificate by the BBFC for strong language and sexual references. It was previously released in an edited PG certificate for family viewing. It was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on May 31, 2004, again uncut like the 15 certificate VHS. It has since been reduced to a 12 certificate.

The PG version currently streams on Disney+, where a notice advises it has been edited for content, primarily removing strong and offensive language.

===Soundtrack album===
In 2015, Intrada Records released an album from the film, featuring the score by Michael Kamen, including unused music and several of the songs heard in the film. It features &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot; by the Crystals, &quot;Babysitting Blues&quot; by Albert Collins, &quot;Twenty-Five Miles&quot; by Edwin Starr, and &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; by Percy Sledge.

====&quot;Babysitting Blues&quot; song====
In a 2021 interview in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, Elisabeth Shue said performing the &quot;iconic &quot;Babysitting Blues&quot; song,&quot; written by pop songwriter Mark Mueller and Robert Kraft, was one of her &quot;favorite experiences of all time.&quot;

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Sweet and spry, &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; gets by on its amiable tone.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; two-and-a-half out of four stars. He cited the blues club sequence as the movie&#x27;s best scene, but criticized the film for not doing more with its black characters. He said the movie had &quot;good raw material,&quot; but too many &quot;unrealized possibilities.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; rated the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;a genial, warm-hearted romp.&quot; He praised the performances of the young cast and called Elisabeth Shue &quot;earnestly appealing,&quot; but criticized the movie for a lack of &quot;social awareness.&quot; Both critics compared the film to &quot;Risky Business&quot; and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

==Unsold television pilot==
The film was adapted into an unsold television pilot of the same name for CBS in 1989. The pilot was broadcast on Friday night, July 7 in the 8 p.m. timeslot. It starred Jennifer Guthrie (who would later co-star on &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot; with Maia Brewton) as Chris, Joey Lawrence as Brad, Courtney Peldon as Sara, Brian Austin Green as Daryl, and Ariana Mohit as Brenda. The pilot garnered CBS a 6.9 rating and was watched by 9.7 million viewers.

==Remake==
Disney reportedly planned a remake for release in 2010. Raven-Symoné was to star in the remake, tentatively titled &quot;Further Adventures in Babysitting&quot;, but withdrew due to other projects. Miley Cyrus was also rumored to be attached to the project, but later denied involvement.

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, Tiffany Paulsen was writing the script. It was presumed that the remake was scrapped due to years of inactivity. However, on January 9, 2015, Disney Channel announced that the remake would go forward, with Sabrina Carpenter and Sofia Carson starring as competing babysitters. The film premiered on Disney Channel in the United States and Canada on June 24, 2016.
