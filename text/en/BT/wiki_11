<text>Steven John Kilbey (born 13 September 1954) is an English born Australian singer-songwriter best known as the lead singer and bass guitarist for the rock band The Church. He is also a music producer, poet, and painter. As of 2020, Kilbey has released 14 solo albums and has collaborated on recordings with musical artists such as Martin Kennedy, Stephen Cummings and Ricky Maymi as a vocalist, musician, writer and/or producer. Ian McFarlane writes that &quot;Kilbey&#x27;s solo recordings [are] challenging and evocative. They ran the gamut of sounds and emotions from electronic and avant-garde to acoustic and symphonic, joyous and dreamy to saturnine and sardonic&quot;.

As of 2020, Kilbey has over 1,000 original songs registered with Australian copyright agency Australasian Performing Right Association.

==Career==
===1954–1979: Early years===
Kilbey was born in Welwyn Garden City, England, UK, and moved to Australia with his parents at the age of five. He grew up around Dapto but the family eventually moved to Canberra. He began his professional music career at the age of 17 when he joined a Canberran five piece &quot;cabaret band&quot; called Saga. Around 1974 he joined a rock band featuring future Church bandmate Peter Koppes on drums called Precious Little.

This was followed by Kilbey forming Baby Grande around 1974 whilst still living in the Australian Capital Territory Koppes was also in Baby Grande for a time but left to travel, then played in a band called Limazine which brought him in touch with future Church drummer Nick Ward. Baby Grande recorded some demos for EMI Australia in 1977 but were not signed to a permanent recording contract. Baby Grande&#x27;s demos surfaced on the internet after about 30 years, and despite initial protests from Kilbey, he has now made four of the five tracks available on his solo compilation album of early work &quot;Addendaone&quot; (2012).

Kilbey was also a member of the new wave band Tactics for approximately a month in 1977. He played &quot;about four gigs&quot; with Tactics before being asked to leave by the band&#x27;s singer and songwriter Dave Studdert.

===1980–present: The Church===

Kilbey formed the Church, together with Koppes and Nick Ward in Sydney in the late 1970s. Marty Willson Piper joined the band in May 1980 days after his arrival in Australia when he went to see the band play a gig. After some success in their native Australia in the early 1980s, Kilbey and The Church went on to international fame when &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot;, from the 1988 album &quot;Starfish&quot;, achieved success (Kilbey had co-written the song with Karin Jansson of Pink Champagne and Curious Yellow). &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; appeared in the top-selling singles charts of both Australia and the United States (US). In late 2011 Kilbey revealed that, at the time of the interview, the song was still used for television programmes and advertisements. The Church were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2012. At the ceremony, Kilbey delivered a lengthy speech as part of the induction that included stories from his musical career and a sung verse from the song &quot;Old Man Emu&quot; by Australian country music artist John Williamson.

In late 2012, as an act of protest against the conduct of the Church&#x27;s North American label Second Motion Records, Kilbey announced his resignation from the band. The announcement was made on Kilbey&#x27;s Facebook fan page following the receipt of an insufficient royalty cheque from the record label. However, the Church continued as an active band and, in November 2013, Kilbey published an official announcement on his Facebook fan page stating that Willson-Piper was replaced by former Powderfinger member Ian Haug. Kilbey explained that Haug would join the band for the recording of a new album, for which he had 16 songs written, as well as subsequent touring, and also defended the decision in the statement saying, &quot;If you can&#x27;t dig it I&#x27;m sorry. This is my f—ing band after all and it has existed at times without Peter and in the beginning without Marty and for times in between while he went AWOL.&quot;

Prior to the release of the Church&#x27;s 21st album, &quot;Further/Deeper&quot;, Kilbey spoke to the media about his prolific body of musical work that is continually growing saying &quot;Just because I&#x27;ve written that many songs [750] doesn&#x27;t mean anything. But imagine if you were having an operation on your brain and a 60-year-old surgeon walked into the theatre. You would think, I&#x27;m in safe hands. He&#x27;s been doing this all his life and he&#x27;s very good at it. I think I have become very good at pulling lyrics and melodies out of the air. Melodies weren&#x27;t always my strong point; on a lot of The Church&#x27;s early records the melodies weren&#x27;t as elaborate as what I&#x27;m doing now. In the last few years, I think I am tapping into something ... It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m tapping into the collective human subconscious.&quot;

===Solo work===
====1985–1991: Red Eye label====
Kilbey released his debut solo single, &quot;This Asphalt Eden&quot; in July 1985.

Kilbey&#x27;s first studio albums &quot;Unearthed&quot;, &quot;Earthed&quot; the mini-album &quot;The Slow Crack&quot; were released in 1986 and 1987. Issued simultaneously with &quot;Earthed&quot; was a book of the same name containing Kilbey&#x27;s prose and poetry (published in 1986). The &quot;Earthed&quot; album was conceived as a possible soundtrack to the reading of the book, which had come first in terms of conception.

Following the worldwide success of The Church&#x27;s &quot;Starfish&quot; album and &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; single, Kilbey returned to his solo career in 1989 with his third album, &quot;Remindlessness&quot; in December 1989. In December 1991, Kilbey released the EP &quot;Narcosis&quot;, his last solo release for the Red Eye label.

====1992–present: Continued success====
In 1992, Kilbey and his younger brother, John Kilbey launched the Australian record label Karmic Hit. The label roster included the owners&#x27; bands, side projects and solo works as well as those by other artists: the Bhagavad Guitars (John Kilbey&#x27;s group), Snog, David Lane and Halogen.

In 1997, Kilbey collaborated with brother Russell on the ambient instrumental/electronic album &quot;Gilt Trip&quot;. (1997) In May 1997, Kilbey released &quot;Narcosis Plus&quot;.

Between 2009 and 2017, Kilbey released numerous collaborative albums with Martin Kennedy of All India Radio as Kilbey/Kennedy. Kennedy explained the inception of the working relationship in a 2013 interview: &quot;I was working with Steve long before I actually met him. Steve had heard All India Radio, and he asked my brother John if I had any spare instrumental songs lying around that he could contribute lyrics to.&quot; Kennedy subsequently sent Kilbey &quot;thrown-away tracks&quot; from All India Radio recording sessions.

In July 2013, Kilbey performed at the Fly By Night venue in the Western Australian port city of Fremantle, with local musicians, Shaun and Adrian Hoffmann (The Hoffmenn), Shaun Corlson, Rachael Aquillina and Anna Sarcich playing as his backing band. Aquillina and Sarcich formed the string section, leading to the naming of the corresponding live recording: &quot;With Strings Attached&quot;. According to Kilbey&#x27;s Time Being site, he explored his &quot;back catalogue of solo releases, collaborations and Church classics&quot; during the performance.

===Other projects===
Kilbey founded Hex and Jack Frost.

====1988–1991: Hex====
In 1988, Kilbey formed the duo Hex with singer, songwriter and guitarist Donnette Thayer. Hex released two albums, the self-titled &quot;Hex&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Vast Halos&quot; 1990.

====1990–1996: Jack Frost====
In 1990, Kilbey formed Jack Frost as a collaboration with Grant McLennan of Brisbane band The Go-Betweens. Jack Frost released a debut self-titled album in December 1991, preceded by the single &quot;Every Hour God Sends&quot;. The duo released a second studio album, &quot;Snow Job&quot; in 1996, prior to McLennan&#x27;s death.

====1994–1995: Fake====
In 1995, Kilbey formed Fake with Boris Goudenov and Sandy Chick. Fake released a self-titled album on Mushroom records in 1994.

====2004–2012: Isidore====
In 2004, Kilbey formed Isidore with John Kilbey and Jeffrey Cain of Remy Zero. Isidore released a self-titled album in 2004 and a second album &quot;Life Somewhere Else&quot; in 2012.

====2007: Mimesis====
In 2007, Kilbey formed the ambient, psychedelic crossover band, Mimesis, with Simon Polinski, Colin Berwick and David Abiuso. They released an album, &quot;Art Imitating Life&quot; in 2007 on the Psy-Harmonics label.

====2013: Speed of the Stars====
The band &quot;Speed of The Stars&quot; is Steve Kilbey of The Church and Frank Kearns of Cactus World News. Together they started work on this project back in the late 90&#x27;s and released the first album in 2016. A second album has been recorded with Barton Price and Hugo Race.

==Writing==
Kilbey released &quot;Earthed&quot; in 1986. In 1998, Kilbey published a book of poetry entitled &quot;Nineveh/The Ephemeron&quot;; Kilbey later republished a hard copy version that contained both books and a limited number of 50 copies was released.

In August 2013, &quot;Uncollected&quot;, described as, &quot;A deluxe edition of his books – Earthed, The Ephemeron, Nineveh, Fruit Machine and other selected work&quot;, was released on his own Time Being label. Kilbey&#x27;s inaugural autobiography, &quot;Something Quite Peculiar&quot;, was then published by Hardie Grant on 1 November 2014.

==Personal life==
Kilbey resides in Australia, with his partner Rachel. He has also lived in Stockholm, Sweden and Los Angeles. Kilbey has twin daughters (Elektra and Miranda) with Karin Jansson, his ex-girlfriend. Elektra and Miranda have a popular dream pop duo called Say Lou Lou and record in their homeland of Sweden.

He also has a second set of twins, Eve and Aurora as well as another daughter, Scarlet.

===Drug use===
As documented in the authorised biography &quot;No Certainty Attached&quot; (written with Kilbey&#x27;s involvement), Kilbey was dependent on the drug heroin during the 1990s, an aspect of the musician&#x27;s personal life that was mostly hidden until Kilbey was arrested on a drug-related charge in 1999 in New York City. Kilbey eventually ceased using the drug after a period of detoxification in 2000. In a 2012 interview, Kilbey reflected on his personal history: &quot;I also have a lot of regret that I didn&#x27;t do it better, that I wasn&#x27;t a better person, that I wasn&#x27;t nicer to people or make better records and that at times I would slack off and just do any old thing. I wish I hadn&#x27;t made so many mistakes with the drugs.&quot;

Kilbey stated that he wrote most songs of his while under the influence of marijuana, as it helps him cope with his Asperger syndrome or autism. &quot;Pot allows my mind to do the things it wants to do, which is freely associate&quot;, he said.

Kilbey then participated in an interview for journalist and writer Andrew McMillen&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs&quot;, as well as a July 2014 feature interview with McMillen for the &quot;Australian&quot; newspaper. Kilbey explained in an article that he was introduced to the drug by now-deceased Australian musician Grant McLennan, of Brisbane band The Go-Betweens, during the recording period for a new project named Jack Frost. &quot;It came right out of the blue... It [heroin] was the last thing on my mind. I went, &#x27;Oh, here&#x27;s $100, get me some too.&#x27; No one had ever offered it to me up until then. All the other drugs you might get offered but no one ever says, &#x27;Hey, want some heroin?&#x27; It&#x27;s not like that. If you&#x27;ve got a stash, you don&#x27;t offer it. You don&#x27;t really go around turning other people on. It&#x27;s not the sort of thing you advertise.&quot;

Kilbey states that he &quot;loved&quot; heroin when he first snorted it and continued to use the drug while living in a Surry Hills, Sydney home that doubled as a recording studio. Kilbey then made the transition to injecting the drug with the assistance of a fellow heroin user who was an unregistered doctor. He explained to McMillen that he also became fascinated with the culture surrounding the use of the drug. Upon reflection, Kilbey described it as a &quot;rubbish world.&quot;

Following unsuccessful interventions involving family and friends and a relocation to Sweden where he found heroin easier to obtain, Kilbey eventually used methadone in 2002 to wean himself off opiates. Since 2002, Kilbey has occasionally used heroin but as he explained in the &quot;Australian&quot; interview, &quot;it [heroin] doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I have no temptation. I&#x27;m just not interested anymore.&quot; The interview concludes with Kilbey expressing his belief about the problematic nature of drug prohibition, whereby the musician referred to opiate use during the 19th century. &quot;We let people have booze, cigarettes, wars ... Why not let them have smack? People used to take it and it wasn&#x27;t seen as a problem. If you lived in 1890 and you were an opium fiend, that was your problem: to take it and to find out how to stop taking it. It was nothing to do with the law ... Now, I&#x27;m not going to sit here and go, &#x27;Oh, kids, look what I did to my life because I was a drug addict. Please don&#x27;t be like me. Please be Mister Straight.&#x27; I don&#x27;t believe in that either. I think we have to grow up and look at why drugs are illegal ... I just don&#x27;t want people to believe the hype, that if you take drugs, you&#x27;re necessarily an evil villain. You might be a silly person or a weak person. But you&#x27;re not a bad person.&quot;

===Spirituality===
Kilbey has revealed that he and Richard Ploog often visited Sydney&#x27;s Adyar Bookshop (bookshop of the Theosophical Society) during the 1980s to read books by occultist and mystical authors such as Helena Blavatsky, George Gurdjieff and P.D. Ouspensky. Likewise, spiritual mysticism is evident in the lyrics of songs as early as &quot;An Interlude&quot; with its line &quot;psychic angels spread on the top of her head&quot;, and the song &quot;Tear It All Away&quot; whose lyrics are clearly about seeing beyond the mundane . The song &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; on &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot; is about past-life experience (&quot;On a day like this, a hundred lifetimes ago...&quot;). &quot;Myrrh&quot; from &quot;Heyday&quot; includes Christian imagery but seems to be as much about the nature of inner mystical experience: &quot;How can you be so invisible?/Give me the eyes to see/Privilege on privilege/An unwanted discovery&quot; The thread of spiritual exploration runs through many of Kilbey&#x27;s lyrics to the present day, such as on more recent songs such as &quot;Invisible&quot; from 2002 (first appeared on &quot;After Everything Now This&quot;), with its refrain: &quot;All I ever wanted to see was just invisible to me.&quot;

Kilbey&#x27;s lyrics often quote historical and mythological events and his interest in Eastern culture and religion frequently informs his music—this also applies to his painting (he often paints Hindu gods and goddesses). He has cited the Bhagavad Gita as a particular influence, describing himself as a devotee of Krishna.

<doc id="564181" wikidata="Q1757705" url="?curid=564181" title="The Church (band)">
<text>The Church are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1980. Initially associated with new wave, neo-psychedelia, and indie rock, their music later came to feature slower tempos and surreal soundscapes reminiscent of alternative rock, dream pop, and post-rock. Glenn A. Baker has written that &quot;From the release of the &#x27;She Never Said&#x27; single in November 1980, this unique Sydney-originated entity has purveyed a distinctive, ethereal, psychedelic-tinged sound which has alternatively found favour and disfavour in Australia.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;dense, shimmering, exquisite guitar pop&quot;.

The founding members were Steve Kilbey on lead vocals and bass guitar, Peter Koppes and Marty Willson-Piper on guitars, and Nick Ward on drums. Ward played only on their debut album, and the band&#x27;s drummer for the rest of the 1980s was Richard Ploog. Jay Dee Daugherty (ex-Patti Smith Group) played drums from 1990 to 1993, followed by &quot;timEbandit&quot; Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians), who remains with them to the present day. Koppes left the band from 1992 to 1997,
and Willson-Piper left in 2013. Ian Haug, formerly of Powderfinger, replaced him. Kilbey, Koppes, and Powles also recorded together as the Refo:mation in 1997.

The Church&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Of Skins and Heart&quot; (1981), delivered their first radio hit, &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot;, and they were signed to major labels in Australia, Europe, and the United States. However, the US label, dissatisfied with their second album, dropped the band without releasing it. This put a dent in their success in the US, but they returned to the charts in 1988 with the album &quot; Starfish&quot; and the US Top 40 hit &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot;. Subsequent mainstream success has proved elusive, but the band retains a large international cult following and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in Sydney in 2010. The Church continue to tour and record, releasing their 25th studio album, &quot;Man Woman Life Death Infinity&quot;, in October 2017, and their 27th and most recent, &quot;Eros Zeta and the Perfumed Guitars&quot;, in March 2024.

==History==
===1980–1981: Early days, &quot;Of Skins and Heart&quot;===
Singer, songwriter, and bass guitarist Steve Kilbey first played with guitarist Peter Koppes in a glam rock band called Baby Grande in Canberra, Australia in the mid-1970s. After each had left to travel and play in other bands, including Tactics (Kilbey) and Limazine (Koppes), they met again in Sydney in March 1980 and formed the initial three-piece version of The Church, with Limazine drummer Nick Ward. The name was a shortened version of the original name proposed by Kilbey: &quot;The Church of Man&quot;. A month later, Marty Willson-Piper, originally from Liverpool, United Kingdom, witnessed one of their gigs and met Kilbey afterwards. That same night he was invited to join the band on guitar, establishing the classic two-guitar formation.

A four-song demo was recorded in Kilbey&#x27;s bedroom studio and sent, through contacts from his and Koppes&#x27;s old band Baby Grande, to the Australian branch of the Beatles&#x27; publishing company, ATV Northern Songs. The song &quot;Chrome Injury&quot; attracted the attention of managing director Chris Gilbey, who signed the band to his recently formed record production company, in association with EMI and their recently resurrected Parlophone label. Gilbey went to band rehearsals and helped shape their sound—he bought Willson-Piper a 12-string Rickenbacker guitar and equipped Koppes with an Echolette tape delay. Of that first batch of demos, only &quot;Chrome Injury&quot; would go on to be recorded for release.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Of Skins and Heart&quot;, was recorded late in 1980, produced by Gilbey and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Seven of the nine tracks were written solely by Kilbey and two co-written with others. The first single, &quot;She Never Said&quot;, was released in November, but did not chart. At the start of 1981, Ward was replaced on drums by Richard Ploog. Ploog was recruited by their manager, Michael Chugg, after hearing of his reputation in Adelaide. Ploog&#x27;s arrival established The Church&#x27;s first stable line-up. The second single, &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot;, co-written by Kilbey and Michelle Parker, was issued alongside the album in March 1981, but only in Australia initially. &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot; became an Australian top forty hit, reaching No. 22 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, while &quot;Of Skins and Heart&quot; went gold, achieving the same position on the related Albums Chart. To promote the releases, the band undertook their first national tour.

The first recordings with Ploog were released as a five-track double 7-inch EP, &quot;Too Fast for You&quot;, in July. It included the first collectively written track, &quot;Sisters&quot;. Another track, &quot;Tear It All Away&quot;, later released as a separate single, showed a development towards the more elaborate guitar structures which would become part of the band&#x27;s signature sound. Their image and sound now evoked comparisons with 1960s psychedelic groups, with tight jeans, paisley shirts, and Byrds-style jangly guitars.

&quot;Of Skins and Heart&quot;″s commercial success enabled Gilbey to present the release to Freddie Cannon of French label Carrere and Rupert Perry of U.S. label Capitol. Both labels released the album in 1982, renaming it simply &quot;The Church&quot; and slightly altering the track listing to include songs from &quot;Too Fast for You&quot; and using a crop of that EP&#x27;s artwork as the cover. &quot;The Church&quot; peaked at No. 7 in the New Zealand Albums Chart and No. 13 in Sweden. Ploog was incorrectly credited as the sole drummer on the release, despite only playing on one or three tracks, depending on the version. Capitol also released an edited single version of &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot;, without the band&#x27;s approval.

===1982–1985: &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot;, &quot;Seance&quot;, &quot;Remote Luxury&quot;, &quot;Persia&quot;===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot;, was issued in March 1982 and was both produced and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Sonically and stylistically more complex than the debut, it is &quot;a smoother, fuller release&quot;, which showed the clear influence of 1960s psychedelia. &quot;With its mystical lyrics the second album ... brought the group&#x27;s own style more into focus&quot;. The album peaked at No. 10 and its first single, &quot;Almost with You&quot; resulted in a second Top 30 hit, peaking at No. 21.

The Church undertook a second Australian tour, while Carrere released the album in Europe, generating enough sales for them to tour there in October. However, Capitol declined to release &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot; in North America and demanded that they write more radio-friendly material, as exemplified by their stable-mates Little River Band, which horrified the band. After another recording session, five new songs were offered to Capitol but the label was still unimpressed and dropped the band. The five songs were later released in Australia as the EP &quot;Sing-Songs&quot;, which reached the Top 100 Albums Chart in December. Meanwhile, their manager, Michael Chugg, arranged a U.K. tour supporting the hugely successful pop group Duran Duran, but after eight gigs The Church pulled out, feeling that audiences were unsympathetic. Chugg later recalled, &quot;They were hard work. All four of them were strong-willed and had their own ideas of how things should be.&quot; The band also toured Scandinavia and Europe in 1982, and both of their albums were released there to critical acclaim.

In May 1983, the band released their third album, &quot;Seance&quot;, co-produced by The Church and engineer John Bee (Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, The Divinyls), which peaked at No. 18. It used more keyboards and synthesizers and was typically described as &quot;That stark release [which] explored the band&#x27;s darker side, and [whose] tracks ... were awash with strings and other effects&quot;. The accompanying live shows included a guest keyboardist, Melbourne-based session player Dean Walliss.

For &quot;Seance&quot;, the band employed mixing engineer Nick Launay, who had worked with Midnight Oil. He favoured a gated reverb drum sound, popular in the 1980s, which produced a staccato-like snare sound. Unsatisfied with this, the band asked Launay to redo the mix, but the effect was only lightened. The first single, &quot;Electric Lash&quot;, featured this effect especially prominently and it was likened to a &quot;machine gun&quot;. Despite dissatisfaction over the mix, &quot;Seance&quot; featured a lusher, more atmospheric sound with highlights including &quot;Now I Wonder Why&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;. Internationally, the album sold poorly, being considered dark and cryptic, and the general public seemed to lose interest. Some critics in Europe and the U.S. did like the album however, with &quot;Creem&quot; hailing the band as &quot;one of the best in the world&quot;.

&quot;Seance&quot; was again dominated by Kilbey&#x27;s songwriting. Some 20 songs were put together on his home 4-track. Only one band composition made the album: the experimental &quot;Travel by Thought&quot;. Kilbey and Willson-Piper had co-written another track, &quot;10,000 Miles&quot;, but the label rejected it. Kilbey was upset by the label&#x27;s interference, finding the track essential to their live set (it would be included on their next EP). Despite the difficulties, the album yielded two minor hits - &quot;It&#x27;s No Reason&quot; and &quot;Electric Lash&quot; - and stayed in the British independent charts for several months.

The group had built a devoted fan base with their paisley shirts, catchy melodies, and solid live performances. Following the release of &quot;Seance&quot;, they toured Australia and New Zealand for the rest of the year to pay off debts incurred on the European tour. Meanwhile, Capitol Records released their first album in Canada, where it reached the Top 20. The &quot;Sing-Songs&quot; EP also became one of the bestselling Canadian imports of 1983.

Forgoing a full album, the band released two EPs in 1984, &quot;Remote Luxury&quot; in March and &quot;Persia&quot; in August, but only in Australia and New Zealand. Both EPs reached the Top 50 on the Australian Albums Chart. Again, almost all tracks were written by Kilbey, but compared to &quot;Seance&quot;, the atmosphere was lighter and less gloomy. The band&#x27;s trademark guitar sound was complemented by the keyboards of guest musicians Davey Ray Moor (from the Crystal Set, which included Kilbey&#x27;s brother Russell) and Craig Hooper (from the Reels), who joined as an auxiliary member. Hooper soon left to form the Mullanes.

The band then signed to Warner Bros. Records in the United States. Internationally, the two EPs were repackaged as a single album titled &quot;Remote Luxury&quot;. Its U.S. release was their first record there since the debut album – although &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot; and &quot;Seance&quot; had sold well on import. Due to the interest raised in the U.S., they left Michael Chugg Management in Sydney and signed with Malibu Management&#x27;s owner John Lee. They toured the US in October and November and while venues in New York and Los Angeles saw audiences of about 1,000 people, other gigs had as few as 50. In financial terms, the tour went poorly and the band lost thousands of dollars a week.

The Church seemed to reach a nadir in 1984. Unable to repeat the commercial success of the first two albums, there was a perception that their creativity was declining. Kilbey later said: &quot;I think we released a few dud records that weren&#x27;t as good as they should have been, after &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot; ... The band was just drifting along in a sea of apathy, I was writing not-so-good songs and the band wasn&#x27;t playing them very well, so everyone&#x27;s enthusiasm just waned&quot;.

The start of 1985 was quiet for the band as members spent time apart in Stockholm, Sydney, and Jamaica. Kilbey&#x27;s debut solo single, &quot;This Asphalt Eden&quot;, was released by EMI Parlophone and he was also the producer on the single &quot;Benefit of the Doubt&quot; for the Crystal Set.

===1985–1988: &quot;Heyday&quot;, &quot;Starfish&quot;===
The Church reconvened at Studios 301 in mid-1985 to work on their next album, &quot;Heyday&quot;, with British producer/engineer Peter Walsh (Simple Minds, Scott Walker, Peter Gabriel). Their first single in almost two years, &quot;Already Yesterday&quot;, appeared in October and just made the Top 100. &quot;Heyday&quot; followed in November and brought new stylistic elements with the addition of real strings and horns, creating a warm, organic sound. The songs &quot;were among the richest moments in The Church canon&quot;. While Kilbey still wrote the lyrics, the band were now largely writing the music together, a practice which they would continue thereafter.

Released in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the US, the album was warmly received. In Australia, it peaked at No. 19, and it also appeared on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A promotional tour started in April 1986, with concerts both at home and abroad. Unexpectedly, Willson-Piper suddenly quit mid-tour after rising in-band tensions and on 10 July, The Church performed as a three-piece in Hamburg, Germany. Willson-Piper returned within a week after Kilbey agreed that future releases would contain more group efforts.

Despite the charged atmosphere and warm press, low sales for the album&#x27;s singles in Australia prompted EMI to drop them. Plans for a double live album, &quot;Bootleg&quot;, were also scrapped. Since the band had greater sales overseas than in Australia, they decided to record in a studio abroad and opted for a four-album deal with U.S. label Arista Records in 1987. For Australian releases they signed with Mushroom Records.

Recording sessions in Los Angeles, with producers Waddy Wachtel (Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Robbie Williams) and Greg Ladanyi (Warren Zevon, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac), were a new challenge according to Kilbey: &quot;It was Australian hippies versus West Coast guys who know the way they like to do things. We were a bit more undisciplined than they would have liked&quot;. Personality clashes occurred as the two sides bickered over guitar sounds, song structures, and work ethic. Under pressure from the producers, Kilbey took vocal lessons, an experience he later regarded as valuable.

The stress of living in the US influenced their recording, and left Kilbey feeling out of place: Album tracks such as &quot;North, South, East and West&quot;, &quot;Lost,&quot; &quot;Reptile&quot;, and &quot;Destination&quot; bore the imprint of the faces, scenery, and daily life of the group&#x27;s new, temporary home.

Four weeks of gruelling rehearsals resulted in &quot;Starfish&quot;, which focused on capturing the band&#x27;s core sound. Bright, spacious, and uncluttered, the recording was a departure from the layered orchestrations of &quot;Heyday&quot;. The group wanted as live and dynamic an album as possible; Willson-Piper said that trying to record a live atmosphere lacked a real gig&#x27;s sense of &quot;being there&quot;. They found the results bare and simplistic; however, the public reception was unexpected.

Released in April 1988, &quot;Starfish&quot; found its way into the mainstream, marking a new worldwide commercial peak for the band. It reached No. 11 in Australia and the Top 50 in the US. The album was awarded a gold record in December 1992 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Also released in February, the single &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; reached #24 on the US Hot 100, #22 in Australia, and entered the Canadian Top 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks. The song was written by Kilbey and then-girlfriend Karin Jansson (ex-Pink Champagne). A near five-minute video received airtime on music television programs. &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; won an ARIA Award in 1989 for &#x27;Single of the Year&#x27;. In 2008, readers of &quot;The Australian&quot; voted it the best Australian song of the last 20 years. In response, Kilbey said, &quot;it&#x27;s not really about anything at all. I just wanted to create an atmosphere and I didn&#x27;t even put a lot of thought into that. History has given it something that it never really had&quot;.

A second single from &quot;Starfish&quot;, &quot;Reptile&quot;, charted on the Australian Top 100 in August and &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream charts.

EMI responded with a double compilation album, &quot;Hindsight 1980-1987&quot;, which contained selections from the band&#x27;s prior albums, together with hitherto-uncollected singles and B-sides. It peaked in the ARIA Top 40 Albums Chart in July.

===1989–1992: &quot;Gold Afternoon Fix&quot;, &quot;Priest=Aura&quot;===
The Church promoted &quot;Starfish&quot; with a nine-month tour before they returned to the studio for a follow-up. With a US Top 50 album under their belt, there was pressure from Arista to create another. The band started negotiations with former Led Zeppelin bass guitarist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, who had a reputation as a sophisticated producer, but the record company and management vetoed their suggestion. In an attempt to duplicate the success of &quot;Starfish&quot;, The Church returned to Los Angeles, with Waddy Wachtel producing.

While the prior sessions were tense, these were volatile. Already unenthusiastic about the forced pairing, there was the stress of having to create another hit album, and this took its toll. All members were outspoken about the role that drugs played in The Church&#x27;s creative process, but drummer Richard Ploog began to retreat further into his own habit as pressure increased. The number of attempted studio takes spiralled and Ploog&#x27;s relationship with Kilbey deteriorated, accentuated by Wachtel&#x27;s demands for a consistently reliable tempo. Eventually, Ploog&#x27;s isolation led to exclusion and his drum tracks were replaced by rigid, but meter-perfect, programmed drums on all but three tracks. He left the band after the sessions.

The resulting album, &quot;Gold Afternoon Fix&quot;, while different from its predecessor, reached No.12 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. While &quot;Starfish&quot; focused on a raw, live sound, &quot;Gold Afternoon Fix&quot; employed more ambient aspects including piano, acoustic guitars, and keyboards. On some tracks, the music was punctuated by clanging metal, rustling wind, or sharp, industrial sounds.

&quot;Gold Afternoon Fix&quot; was heavily backed by a promotional campaign from Arista and the band went on tour, hiring Patti Smith&#x27;s drummer Jay Dee Daugherty. The album spawned a hit single, &quot;Metropolis&quot; (No. 19 in Australia, No. 11 on U.S. Mainstream Rock), but the follow-up, &quot;You&#x27;re Still Beautiful&quot;, did not chart. Ultimately, the album&#x27;s sales were lower than &quot;Starfish&quot;″s and press was mixed. The band, particularly Kilbey, would later dismiss the album as &quot;lousy&quot;, &quot;hashed together&quot;, and &quot;hideous&quot;, although many of the songs have since become fixtures in the band&#x27;s setlists.

After the dust had settled on &quot;Gold Afternoon Fix&quot;, The Church returned to their old haunt at Sydney&#x27;s Studios 301 to commence work on their next album. With lowered commercial expectations and less pressure from Arista, the atmosphere was more relaxed. Bringing in British producer Gavin MacKillop (Barenaked Ladies, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Straitjacket Fits) to supervise the sessions, the band began to improvise the framework for the next set of songs. The use of opium and, for Kilbey, heroin, saw the material take on a more expansive and surreal quality, while Daugherty&#x27;s jazzier approach on drums was a fresh change.

&quot;Priest=Aura&quot;, titled from Kilbey&#x27;s misreading of a Spanish fan&#x27;s English vocabulary notes (&#x27;priest&#x27; = &#x27;cura&#x27;), contains fourteen songs, many over six minutes long, and was their longest album yet at 65 minutes. With song concepts derived from cryptic, one-word working titles (an idea originally proposed by Willson-Piper), the lyrics leaned towards the abstract and esoteric. Emphasizing free association and undirected coincidence between music and motif, Kilbey declined to define their meanings. Sonically, the music had numerous layers, courtesy of numerous guitar overdubs and MacKillop&#x27;s rich production. The interplay between Koppes and Willson-Piper dominated throughout, especially on tracks such as &quot;Ripple&quot;, &quot;Kings&quot;, and the epic, aptly titled &quot;Chaos&quot;, whose lyrics were a reflection of Steve Kilbey&#x27;s unsettled lifestyle at the time.

Upon its release on 10 March 1992, &quot;Priest=Aura&quot; was given a mixed reception. It peaked in the ARIA Top 30, but reviews were varied, with some critical and others uncertain how to react. The band only went on a limited tour, confined to Australia, as Kilbey prepared for the birth of his twin daughters with Karin Jansson.

Adding to the decline in The Church&#x27;s outlook was the announcement of Koppes&#x27; departure. His decision reflected two main factors: that the band had earned nothing for the two-week tour of Australia, and that he felt shut out of the creative process - a long-standing complaint that stretched back at least as far as &quot;Seance&quot;, if not further. Despite a completely sold-out tour, increasing personality conflicts within the band and frustration over their lack of success had made the situation intolerable. Despite its muted reception at the time of release, &quot;Priest=Aura&quot; is considered by both the band and fan base to be an artistic high point. In his 2014 autobiography, &quot;Something Quite Peculiar&quot;, Kilbey calls it their &quot;undisputed masterpiece&quot;.

===1993–1996: &quot;Sometime Anywhere&quot;, &quot;Magician Among the Spirits&quot;===
Despite the loss of Koppes, Arista decided to stand by the band&#x27;s contract and back another Church album, and so Kilbey and Willson-Piper began to write new material. When it became clear that Daugherty would not be returning to the fold either, the remaining two took the opportunity to approach their music from new perspectives, abandoning their long-established roles and stylistic elements in favour of experimentation, spontaneity, and electronica.

Early in 1994, the two brought in Willson-Piper&#x27;s childhood friend Andy &#x27;Dare&#x27; Mason to produce, record, and mix. The album was mostly recorded at Sydney&#x27;s Karmic Hit Studios and mixed at Karmic Hit and Studios 301. New Zealand drummer Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) was hired for the sessions, having already played with Kilbey on his Jack Frost project. Considered temporary at the time, Powles would soon become a permanent member of the band and is still with them over 20 years later.

The resulting album, &quot;Sometime Anywhere&quot;, released in May 1994, was generally well received and peaked in the Top 30. It is described as a &quot;rich, dark, epic release [which] picked up where &quot;Priest&quot; left off with lush, lengthy tracks&quot;. Sales, however, were paltry and the first single, &quot;Two Places at Once&quot;, did not chart. Promotion was minimal as Arista saw insufficient commercial promise in the release. With another commercially unsuccessful album on their hands, Arista did not renew The Church&#x27;s contract and pulled financial support for a tour. Ambitious plans to stage full electric shows were scaled back, leaving Kilbey and Willson-Piper with only a short run of acoustic gigs as a duo.

Without a recording deal, the band&#x27;s future looked bleak as Kilbey and Willson-Piper began work on new recordings in 1995. Although initially a two-man project, the new material saw input from new drummer Powles and hired violinist Linda Neil. Renewed contact between Kilbey and Peter Koppes led to the latter agreeing to guest on four songs - a welcome surprise for fans. Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi) was drafted in to co-produce, engineer, and mix the sessions. The music saw a return to guitar-based material, infused with krautrock and art rock influences. A 15-minute atmospheric piece called &quot;Magician Among the Spirits&quot; dominated the sessions, named after a book by Harry Houdini. Additional contributions by Utungun Percussion added a new, primal aspect to several songs.

The album, also called &quot;Magician Among the Spirits&quot;, received mixed reviews, despite the guitar rock hook of its single &quot;Comedown&quot;. It was released on the band&#x27;s own &quot;Deep Karma&quot; label, but due to financial constraints, they had to arrange outside distribution for the North American and European markets. This almost doomed the album from the beginning, but worse events were to come. Within a short time, the U.S. distributor went bankrupt, leaving the band stripped of its earnings from North American sales. Although exact figures remain unknown due to disputes, up to A$250,000 worth of merchandise (some 25,000 discs) was lost. For a band already on shaky ground, this was nearly the death knell. Comments by Kilbey in May of that year summed up the situation: &quot;There&#x27;s no immediate future for The Church...Our management, the whole thing is broken down...We don&#x27;t really have a label. We&#x27;re owed lots and lots of money and we&#x27;re broke. We&#x27;re trying to pursue lawyers to get our money back. Marty and I aren&#x27;t having any communication. There&#x27;s no one really managing us so...that could have been the last record.&quot;

===1997–1999: The Refo:mation, &quot;Hologram of Baal&quot;, &quot;A Box of Birds&quot;===
Following the commercial failure of &quot;Magician Among the Spirits&quot;, the members of The Church turned their attention to other projects and Willson-Piper left Australia again in order to collaborate with other artists and write new solo material. In his absence, Kilbey, Powles, and Koppes spent some studio time together and quickly wrote and recorded an album as The Refo:mation, utilizing Powles also as a mix engineer. Loose in feel but rich in atmosphere, the eccentrically-titled &quot;Pharmakoi/Distance-Crunching Honchos with Echo Units&quot; saw a greater focus on concise, guitar-dominated songs, in contrast to the experimentation of &quot;Magician Among the Spirits&quot;.

Group tensions within The Church proper were still simmering, however. More than anyone else, it was new drummer Tim Powles who tried to alleviate the outstanding disagreements. While Koppes and Willson-Piper had already had differences for some time, Kilbey and Willson-Piper&#x27;s relationship was also strained by recent problems. Kilbey declared that the end was nigh: after a final, worthy swan song, with the working title &quot;Au Revoir Por Favor&quot;, the Church would be put to rest. The four agreed to play a string of farewell concerts around Australia, which turned out to be extremely successful. The roaring success of the intended &quot;final concert&quot; in Sydney put a quick end to talk of the band&#x27;s demise.

The results of the new recording sessions saw a return to the band&#x27;s roots: the material was once again based around Koppes and Willson-Piper&#x27;s guitar interplay. Also, for the first time, the band completely produced the work themselves, under Powles&#x27; aegis. Originally given the name &quot;Bastard Universe&quot;, the forthcoming album was re-titled &quot;Hologram of Allah&quot; after Willson-Piper found the original too negative. Concerns about fundamentalist Muslim reaction to the potentially blasphemous title made the band finally opt for the more neutral &quot;Hologram of Baal&quot;, after the Canaanite god. Released under a new contract with UK independent label Cooking Vinyl, the album was distributed in the U.S. by Thirsty Ear. A limited edition featured a bonus disc with a nearly 80-minute continuous improvised instrumental, which received the original title of the album, &quot;Bastard Universe&quot;.

The reformed and rejuvenated band went on their first fully electric tour of the U.S., Australia, and Europe in many years. A plan to release a live album called &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; was put into motion, but then cancelled.

Instead, a collection of cover songs was recorded in Sweden, shedding light on the band&#x27;s influences. Arriving in August 1999 - less than a year after &quot;Hologram of Baal&quot; - &quot;A Box of Birds&quot; contained an unusual selection of songs from Ultravox and Iggy Pop to The Monkees and Neil Young. The insert for the CD was designed as interchangeable, with 10 separate sleeve designs created by fans. As with &quot;Hologram of Baal&quot;, a tour followed the album&#x27;s release, but new drama hit the band mid-tour in New York City when Kilbey was arrested for trying to purchase heroin. The band was forced to improvise a set after he failed to show, with Willson-Piper covering vocals. A night in jail and a day&#x27;s community service on the Manhattan subway were Kilbey&#x27;s only punishment. &quot;A drug bust is something every aging rock star should have under his belt&quot;, he was later quoted as saying.

===2000–2007: &quot;After Everything Now This&quot;, &quot;Forget Yourself&quot;, &quot;Uninvited, Like the Clouds&quot;===
In 2001, &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, helping to raise the band&#x27;s profile once again. However, recording for their next album turned out to be painstakingly slow due to numerous side projects and simple geography. With Kilbey now living in Sweden, Willson-Piper in England, and the others in Australia, the bandmates met across several separate sessions. Partially recorded in Sweden, NYC, and Australia, the resulting &quot;After Everything Now This&quot;, released in January 2002, saw a focus on the softer elements of the band, with responsibility for production and final mixing again resting on Powles. With only three obvious &quot;rock&quot; tracks out of ten, gentler moods dominated. The album achieved the biggest international success for The Church in almost ten years. The successive world tour featured the band in a more subtle setting as well, with most tracks performed primarily acoustically alongside guest David Lane on piano.

Fans would not have to wait long for another group release. The double-disc remix/outtakes set &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; hit stores in late 2002. Unique among the band&#x27;s catalogue, the first disc, subtitled &quot;remixture&quot;, featured a reshuffled, remixed, electronic version of the &quot;After Everything Now This&quot; album, the result of Tim Powles&#x27; collaboration with Sydney EDM musicians. The second disc, subtitled &quot;mixture&quot;, compiled leftover songs from the &quot;After Everything Now This&quot; recording sessions.

Around the time that &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; was released, the Church had returned to the studio to record yet another album, eventually titled &quot;Forget Yourself&quot;. Rather than fleshing the songs out over a long, gradual process, the band decided to keep the music as close to the original jam-based material as possible. Stylistically, this made for a much rawer sound, primarily recorded live and with minimal overdubs. As had become routine since &quot;Sometime Anywhere&quot;, songs saw numerous instrument changes between members, with Powles playing lead guitar on &quot;Sealine&quot;,&quot;Maya&quot;, and &quot;Reversal&quot;, and Willson-Piper switching to drums on &quot;Maya&quot;. &quot;Forget Yourself&quot; was engineered and co-produced by Nic Hard and was released in Australia in October 2003 and in the U.S. in February 2004. The band toured extensively to support the album in Australia, the U.S., and Europe.

Their prolific output continued into 2004 with the release of three ancillary albums. Under the guidance of manager Kevin Lane Keller - an American fan and marketing professor who had been working with the band since 2001 - the Church began capitalizing on the advantages offered by the internet and the independent music industry. First, in August, came the entirely improvised album &quot;Jammed&quot;, containing just two long tracks and available exclusively from the band&#x27;s website. Next, in October, came their third outtakes album, &quot;Beside Yourself&quot;, covering the &quot;Forget Yourself&quot; sessions. Finally, only six weeks later, came &quot;El Momento Descuidado&quot;, in which the band presented old and new material in an acoustic setting, for the Liberation Blue label. The title was a rough tongue-in-cheek translation of &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot;, a version of which was included. A short acoustic tour followed in late 2004, which initiated a new practice amongst the band members: that of swapping instruments on stage. The album was eventually nominated in 2005 for &quot;Best Adult Contemporary Album&quot; at the Australian ARIA Music Awards, although it did not win.

In 2005, The Church returned to full electric mode and began work on new material once again. The first release from these sessions was the outtakes album &quot;Back with Two Beasts&quot;, released via their website as a teaser for the main album which would follow a few months later. &quot;Back with Two Beasts&quot; has over time come to have a &quot;main&quot; album life of its own, with tracks being featured on Apple music and the like, being seen by many fans as the band at its fluid and fresh artistic best. &quot;Uninvited, Like the Clouds&quot;, their 20th studio album, was released to rapturous reviews in April 2006 and was followed once again by extensive touring in Europe, the U.S., and Australia. Just before its release, in March, they performed &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra as part of the 2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.

In February 2007 came &quot;El Momento Siguiente&quot;, a second album of acoustic re-interpretations of earlier songs plus several new compositions and a cover version of the Triffids classic &quot;Wide Open Road&quot;. Later that year, the band toured Australia with the Pretenders, and EMI released the double-CD collection &quot;Deep in the Shallows – The Classic Singles Collection&quot;.

===2008–2011: &quot;Shriek&quot;, &quot;Untitled #23&quot;, ARIA Hall of Fame induction, 30th anniversary===
In 2006, The Church had embarked on their third improvised music project: to provide the soundtrack for a short film based on the renowned American science fiction writer Jeff VanderMeer&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;. The music was released in 2008 as the album &quot;Shriek: Excerpts from the Soundtrack&quot;, and was the first release on their new label, Unorthodox Records, a partnership with MGM Distribution.

In February 2009, the band began the build-up to their next major studio album with the &quot;Coffee Hounds&quot; EP, which featured the original, non-album composition &quot;The Coffee Song&quot;, and a cover of Kate Bush&#x27;s classic &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. The following month they released the &quot;Pangaea&quot; EP, whose title track would also be on the upcoming album.

Unorthodox Records released the album &quot;Untitled#23&quot; in Australia in March and the U.S. label Second Motion Records released it to the rest of the world shortly thereafter. Recorded at Powles&#x27; Spacejunk III Studios by engineer/artist Jorden Brebach, who mixed many of the tracks, a double vinyl version quickly sold out. It was the band&#x27;s 23rd album-length Australian release of original studio material, while Kilbey also alluded to the mystical significance of the number 23 in an interview with music publication &quot;Music Feeds&quot;. Another major international tour followed, the &quot;So Love May Find Us&quot; tour, named after a non-album track from the &quot;Pangaea&quot; EP.

Coinciding with the tour, a book entitled &quot;No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church&quot; by Robert Dean Lurie was published in Australia, the US, and the UK by Verse Chorus Press. While primarily a biography of Kilbey, the book also traced the evolution of the band from his perspective. This was not an official band project but Kilbey, Koppes, and various friends and family members did participate.

On 27 November 2009, the Church released another EP, &quot;Operetta&quot;. The title track was taken from &quot;Untitled #23&quot; but the remaining tracks, including the 34-minute improvisation &quot;Particles Matter&quot;, were unique to this release.

In February 2010, the band announced that they would be celebrating their thirtieth anniversary with an acoustic tour entitled &quot;An Intimate Space&quot;. In a unique programme, the band chose one song from each of their many albums and performed them in reverse chronological order. The shows included a 28-page program and the &quot;Deadman&#x27;s Hand&quot; EP, which included more unreleased material from the &quot;Untitled #23&quot; sessions and some tracks specifically shaped by Powles for the release. The US leg of the tour spanned April and May, including a performance of &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; on KUSI News in San Diego.

In October, Second Motion Records re-released six early Church albums in the US, with bonus tracks and extensive liner notes by Willson-Piper, along with the &quot;Deep in the Shallows&quot; singles collection.

On 27 October 2010, the Church were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association Hall of Fame by media commentator George Negus, while young pop singer Washington performed &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot;. After their acceptance speech, the band performed &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; and &quot;Tantalized&quot;. In November and December, they continued with the Australian leg of their &quot;An Intimate Space&quot; tour.

The band travelled to the US once again in February 2011 in full electric mode for the &quot;Future Past Perfect&quot; tour, performing three albums in their entirety: &quot;Untitled#23&quot;, &quot;Priest=Aura&quot;, and &quot;Starfish&quot;. Sold-out dates were played in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Alexandria, Philadelphia, New York, Foxborough, and Atlanta. This tour was the first on which the band was augmented onstage by the Australian multi-instrumentalist Craig Wilson, from the band ASTREETLIGHTSONG.

On 10 April 2010, The Church further celebrated their 30th anniversary with a special show entitled &quot;A Psychedelic Symphony&quot; at the Sydney Opera House, which had been a year in preparation. Accompanied by conductor George Ellis and the George Ellis Symphony Orchestra, the concert was performed to a sold-out 2,000+ capacity crowd and was recorded and filmed. A DVD and double CD were released by Unorthodox in June 2014, the band&#x27;s first official live album. The show was also broadcast on the Australian music TV channel MAX during October 2011.

In December 2010, they concluded the &quot;Future Past Perfect&quot; tour with a dozen Australian dates. Their show of 17 December at the Enmore Theatre, Sydney, was filmed and is available to stream online.

===2012 onward: Royalty dispute, member departures, new releases===
In November and December 2012, The Church played a major series of concerts across Australia and New Zealand, together with Simple Minds, Devo, and Models. As part of the tour, they also played several &quot;A Day on the Green&quot; events with Models. During this tour, they also played two intimate &quot;Art Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; shows, one at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne and the other at the Factory Theatre in Sydney, where each member chose four songs from the band&#x27;s catalogue, interspersed with a selection of concert staples.

In March 2013, there were the outward signs of internal problems in the band when Steve Kilbey issued a series of statements which indicated that he was considering leaving The Church due to a dispute over royalty payments. Then, later in the year, Kilbey announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that Marty Willson-Piper would not be returning and had been replaced by former Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug. Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was &quot;not available&quot; for the recording of a new album and subsequent touring, and praised Haug as &quot;a brilliant guitarist&quot;. Kilbey also provided a pre-emptive response to disgruntled fans: &quot;... if you can&#x27;t dig it I&#x27;m sorry. this is my fucking band after all and it has existed at times without Peter and in the beginning without Marty.&quot;

In early October 2014, Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was not asked to leave the band but that he had simply not replied to the various attempts made to contact him. Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, and in agreement with Powles at the time, Kilbey said &quot;Yes, we have to find someone with stature. He has to have his own trip, he can&#x27;t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas.&quot; As part of the same interview, Haug explained that he had received a phone call from Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, &quot;If I asked you to join The Church, what would you say?&quot; and ended the call after Haug&#x27;s affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the &quot;last thing&quot; that would have entered his mind, but that &quot;it just really seemed to work&quot;.

Entitled &quot;Further/Deeper&quot;, the Church&#x27;s 24th studio album was released on 17 October 2014. Recorded over a period of eight days in late 2013, &quot;Further/Deeper&quot; was produced and engineered by Powles. Writing for the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot;, Noel Mengel rated the album with 4.5 stars, while Jeff Apter assigned the album 4 stars in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;. The band performed the album in its entirety during the &quot;Further/Deeper&quot; tours of Australia, then headed to North America and Europe, with a guest spot and select shows at SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas, and then a career-defining set on one of the prestigious PrimaVera festival&#x27;s main stages in Barcelona, Spain.

In July, August, and September 2015, the band toured Australia, finishing at Splendour in the Grass festival, and then going to the U.S. again, co-headlining with The Psychedelic Furs on most of these dates. On this tour, at select headline side shows, the band played most of &quot;Further/Deeper&quot; plus &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot; in their entirety. Upon arriving back in Australia, they headlined the boutique Small World Festival in Sydney&#x27;s Newtown neighbourhood.

In 2016, the band returned to the U.S. again twice, first for a more comprehensive headline tour playing &quot;The Blurred Crusade&quot; in its entirety and including an invite to the main stage with The Flaming Lips and Young Fathers at Mavericks Festival in San Antonio, Texas. Then, in July, they toured the US again, repeating the success of 2015 by once again sharing larger venues with The Psychedelic Furs.

2017 brought the recording and release of The Church&#x27;s 25th album, &quot;Man Woman Life Death Infinity&quot;. It was released on 6 October and was preceded by two singles, the album opener &quot;Another Century&quot; and the fourth track, &quot;Undersea&quot;. About the album, Steve Kilbey commented, &quot;This is The Church&#x27;s water record. I&#x27;ve always marveled at the seas, rivers, and rain. It wasn&#x27;t conscious at all, but on reflection, it definitely is a preoccupation on this record.&quot; The band toured North America in September and October before returning home to Australia for a string of dates in November and December.

On 1 February 2020, Steve Kilbey announced on Facebook that Peter Koppes had departed the group and that touring member Jeffrey Cain had been promoted to full member status, with Even guitarist Ashley Naylor also being brought into the lineup. In 2023, the band released the album &quot;The Hypnogogue&quot; and followed it with &quot;Eros Zeta and the Perfumed Guitars&quot; in 2024.

<text>The Board of Governors of the BBC was the governing body of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). It consisted of twelve people who together regulated the BBC and represented the interests of the public. It existed from 1927 until it was replaced by the BBC Trust on 1 January 2007.

The governors were independent of the Director-General and the rest of the BBC&#x27;s executive team. They had no direct say in programme-making, but were nevertheless accountable to Parliament and to licence fee payers for the BBC&#x27;s actions. Although a &#x27;state broadcaster&#x27;, the BBC is theoretically protected from government interference due to the statutory independence of its governing body.

The Governors&#x27; role was to appoint the Director-General (and in earlier years, other key BBC staff). They approved strategy and policy, set objectives, oversaw complaints, and produced &quot;Annual Reports&quot; that documented the BBC&#x27;s performance and compliance each year.

The role of chairman of the Board of Governors, though a non-executive, was one of the most important positions in British media.

==Appointments==

Governors were usually appointed from senior positions in various parts of British society. Appointments were part-time positions and lasted for four (formerly five) years. Four governors were given specific responsibilities: for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regions.

Governors were nominally appointed by the monarch on the advice of ministers. In practice, governors were chosen by the government of the day. This led to claims of political interference, in particular during the years of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s premiership.

==Controversy==

It has also been suggested that Harold Wilson&#x27;s appointment of the former Tory minister Lord Hill of Luton as chairman of the Board of Governors in 1967 was motivated by a desire to undermine the radical, questioning agenda of Director-General Sir Hugh Greene. Ironically, Wilson had attacked the appointment of Hill as Chairman of the Independent Television Authority by a Conservative government in 1963.

Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government appointed a succession of governors with the apparent intent of bringing the BBC &quot;into line&quot; with government policy. Marmaduke Hussey was appointed chairman of the Board of Governors apparently with the specific agenda of bringing down the then-Director-General, Alasdair Milne; this government also broke the tradition of always having a trade union leader on the Board of Governors.

A later Director-General, Mark Thompson, said that staff were &quot;quite mystified&quot; by the rise of Margaret Thatcher and that the BBC had a left-wing bias at the time.

In January 2004, Gavyn Davies, who had been appointed chairman of the Board of Governors by the Labour government in 2001, resigned in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry. Lord Ryder of Wensum, previously a Conservative Member of Parliament and a member of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s personal staff, replaced him as Acting Chairman. It has been claimed that Ryder and other Conservatives on the Board of Governors were effectively responsible for &quot;forcing out&quot; Director-General Greg Dyke, who had not initially believed that his offer of resignation would be accepted by the Governors.

In May 2004, Michael Grade took over as permanent chairman. He was to be the last permanent chairman of the Board of Governors.

<doc id="564196" wikidata="Q2167095" url="?curid=564196" title="List of Oz books">
<text>The &quot;Oz&quot; books form a book series that begins with &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) and relates the fictional history of the Land of Oz. Oz was created by author L. Frank Baum, who went on to write fourteen full-length &quot;Oz&quot; books. Baum was styled as &quot;the Royal Historian of Oz&quot; in order to emphasize the concept that Oz is an actual place on Earth, full of magic. In his &quot;Oz&quot; books, Baum created the illusion that characters such as Dorothy and Princess Ozma relayed their adventures in Oz to Baum themselves, by means of a wireless telegraph.

After Baum&#x27;s death in 1919, publisher Reilly &amp; Lee continued to produce annual &quot;Oz&quot; books, passing on the role of Royal Historian. Ruth Plumly Thompson took up the task in 1921, and wrote nineteen &quot;Oz&quot; books. After Thompson, Reilly &amp; Lee published seven more books in the series: three by John R. Neill, two by Jack Snow, one by Rachel R.C. Payes, and a final book by Eloise Jarvis McGraw and Lauren Lynn McGraw. The forty books in Reilly &amp; Lee&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; series are called &quot;the Famous Forty&quot; by fans, and are considered the canonical &quot;Oz&quot; texts.

==Books by L. Frank Baum==
===&quot;Oz&quot; books===

===Story compilations and other works===
In addition to the canonical &quot;Oz&quot; books, several of Baum&#x27;s works that are not &quot;Oz&quot; stories are nevertheless nominally set in the same fictional universe as the &quot;Oz&quot; books, and include several character crossovers. These are: 
&quot;Queen Zixi of Ix&quot;, &quot;The Magical Monarch of Mo&quot;, &quot;The Sea Fairies&quot;, &quot;Sky Island&quot;, &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot;, and &quot;John Dough and the Cherub&quot;.

==The rest of the &quot;Famous Forty&quot;==
Following Baum&#x27;s death, publisher Reilly &amp; Lee continued publishing annual &quot;Oz&quot; books, selecting new Royal Historians to record the latest Oz doings. These books, together with Baum&#x27;s original fourteen novels, form the &quot;Famous Forty&quot;, and are considered the canonical books of the series.

Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s style was markedly different from Baum&#x27;s. Her tales harked back to more traditional fairy tales. She often included a small kingdom, with a prince or princess who saves his or her kingdom and regains the throne or saves Oz from invasion. 

===Books by Ruth Plumly Thompson===

Thompson wrote two additional novels in the 1970s which are not included in the &quot;Famous Forty&quot;: &quot;Yankee in Oz&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Enchanted Island of Oz&quot; (1976), both published by the International Wizard of Oz Club.

===Books by John R. Neill===
Illustrator John R. Neill&#x27;s vision of Oz is more manic than Thompson or Baum&#x27;s. Houses often get up and do battle, and everything can be alive. His entries take Oz&#x27;s color scheme (blue for Munchkin Country, red for Quadling Country, etc.) to an extreme, extending it to sky and skin colors.

===Books by Jack Snow===
Jack Snow was a Baum scholar, and even offered to take over the series at age twelve when Baum died. Snow&#x27;s books lack any characters created by Thompson or Neill, although he did create his own.

===Book by Rachel R.C. Payes===
===Book by Eloise Jarvis McGraw and Lauren Lynn McGraw===
==Additional books==
===Books published by the International Wizard of Oz Club ===
===Books recognized by L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Family Trust===
=== Additional books by the earlier writers ===
=== Books by other writers ===
Some are in line with the originals, while others deviate in various ways.
== Alternate &quot;Oz&quot; books ==
Below are some books that deal with alternate versions of Oz, which do not follow the &quot;Oz&quot; canon originally established by L. Frank Baum.

===Books by Gregory Maguire===
===Books by Alexander Volkov===
Alexander Volkov was a Russian novelist who published his own series of Oz novels called the &quot;Magic Land&quot; books, for readers in Soviet Russia, China and East Germany. His first book, published in 1939, was a translation and adaptation of Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, but the further books that he wrote in the 1960s and 70s were entirely Volkov&#x27;s invention.

<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) was created under the terms of the Railways Act 1921. The first schedule to that Act listed four groups, and for each, a number of &quot;Constituent Companies&quot; were listed, as were a number of subsidiary companies. The constituent companies would amalgamate to create a new railway company, and the subsidiary companies would be absorbed either by one of the constituent companies prior to the amalgamation, or by the new railway company after amalgamation. The group that was to become the LMS was described in the Act as &quot;the North Western, Midland and West Scottish Group&quot;.

<doc id="564203" wikidata="Q975780" url="?curid=564203" title="Transport Act 1947">
<text>The Transport Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 49) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the Act, the railway network, long-distance road haulage and various other types of transport were nationalised and came under the administration of the British Transport Commission. The BTC was responsible to the Ministry of Transport for general transport policy, which it exercised principally through financial control of a number of executives set up to manage specified sections of the industry under schemes of delegation.

==Overview==
The Act was part of the nationalisation agenda of Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour government, and took effect from 1 January 1948. In Northern Ireland, the Ulster Transport Authority acted in a similar manner. The government also nationalised other means of transport such as: canals, sea and shipping ports, bus companies, and eventually, in the face of much opposition, road haulage. All of these transport modes, including British Railways, were brought under the control of a new body, the British Transport Commission (BTC).

The BTC was a part of a highly ambitious scheme to create a publicly owned, centrally planned, integrated transport system. In theory, the BTC was to co-ordinate different modes of transport, to co-operate and supplement each other instead of competing. This was to be achieved by means of fare and rate adjustments. In practice, very little integration between modes ever materialised.

Section 5 of the Act provided for the setting up of a number of executives within the BTC: the Railway Executive; the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive; the Road Transport Executive; and the London Transport Executive were to be created immediately, with the Hotels Executive to be set up at a later date. The same section allowed the number and names of these executives to be varied as necessary.

==Road transport==
The road haulage industry bitterly opposed nationalisation, and found allies in the Conservative Party. Once the Conservatives were elected in 1951, road haulage was soon privatised and deregulated, but the railways and buses remained regulated, and were left under the control of the British Transport Commission.

==Railways==

Following the Second World War, the Big Four railway companies of the grouping era were effectively bankrupt, and the Act was intended to bring about some stability in transport policy. As part of that policy, British Railways was established to run the railways. (The Transport Act 1948 later transferred the lines in Northern Ireland formerly of the LMS, the Northern Counties Committee, to the Ulster Transport Authority.)

Shares in the railway companies were exchanged for British Transport Stock, with a guaranteed 3% return chargeable to the BTC, and were repayable after forty years.

The level of compensation paid has proved to be a matter of historical controversy. Some commentators, including &quot;The Economist&quot; and the London Stock Exchange stated that because the government based the levels of compensation for former railway shareholders on the valuation of their shares in 1946 (when the whole railway infrastructure was in a run-down and dilapidated state because of war damage and minimal maintenance) the railways were acquired comparatively cheaply.

However, others point out that three of the Big Four were effectively bankrupt before the onset of war in 1939 and were only saved from the ignominy of actually declaring bankruptcy by the guaranteed income provided by the wartime government and the temporary surge in rail traffic caused by the restrictions on other forms of transport during and immediately after the war. The exchange of potentially worthless private stock for government gilts based on a valuation during an artificially created boom could thus be considered a very good deal.

Despite nationalisation and the creation of British Railways (BR), the rail system changed little, and was left in much the same way as it had been before nationalisation. BR was divided into six administrative regions: Eastern, London Midland, North Eastern, Scottish, Southern and Western.

These closely mirrored the regions covered by the former companies in England and Wales, although with the addition of a separate Scottish Region. The North Eastern Region was eventually amalgamated with the Eastern Region, reflecting the English operations of the 1923–1947 London and North Eastern Railway.

==Transport Act 1962==

Fifteen years later, under the Transport Act 1962, Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government dissolved the British Transport Commission and created the British Railways Board to take over railway duties from 1 January 1963 and the Transport Holding Company to take over their bus operations from the same date.

<text>Esports (), short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, played individually or as teams.

Multiplayer competitions were long a part of video game culture, but were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when the advent of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, enabled a surge in participation by professional gamers and spectators. By the 2010s, esports was a major part of the video game industry, with many game developers designing for and funding for tournaments and other events.

Esports first became popular in East Asia, particularly in China and South Korea (which first licensed professional players in 2000) but less so in Japan, whose broad anti-gambling laws prohibit professional gaming tournaments. Esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, which host regional and international events.

The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting games, card, battle royales, and real-time strategy (RTS) games. Popular esports franchises include &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Dota&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Valorant&quot;, &quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot;. Among the most popular tournaments are the &quot;League of Legends&quot; World Championship, &quot;Dota 2&quot; International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia. The International Olympic Committee has discussed their inclusion in future Olympic events, starting with the Olympic Esports Games set to be held in 2027.

In the early 2010s, viewership was about 85% male and 15% female, with most viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. By the late 2010s, it was estimated that by 2020, the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than 1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of the global esports revenue.

==History==

===Early history (1972–1989)===
The earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at Stanford University for the game &quot;Spacewar!&quot; Stanford students were invited to an &quot;Intergalactic spacewar olympics&quot; whose grand prize was a year&#x27;s subscription for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all tournament, and Slim Tovar and Robert E. Maas winning the team competition.

Contemporary esports has roots in competitive face-to-face arcade video game competitions. A forerunner of esports was held by Sega in 1974, the All Japan TV Game Championships, a nationwide arcade video game tournament in Japan. The tournament was intended by Sega to promote the play and sales of video games in the country. There were local tournaments held in 300 locations across Japan, and then sixteen finalists from across the country competed in the final elimination rounds at Tokyo&#x27;s Hotel Pacific. Prizes awarded included television sets (color and black-and-white), cassette tape recorders and transistor radios. According to Sega, the tournament &quot;proved to be the biggest event ever&quot; in the arcade game industry, and was attended by members from leading Japanese newspapers and leisure industry companies. Sega stressed &quot;the importance of such tournaments to foster better business relationships between the maker-location-customer and create an atmosphere of competition on TV amusement games&quot;. In 1977, Gremlin Industries (a year before being acquired by Sega) held a marketing stunt to promote their early arcade snake game &quot;Hustle&quot; in the United States, involving the &quot;Gremlin Girls&quot; who were a duo of professional female arcade players called Sabrina Osment and Lynn Reid. The pair travelled across 19 American cities, where players could challenge them in best-of-three matches for a chance to win money. The duo were challenged by a total of 1,300 players, only about seven of whom managed to beat them.

The golden age of arcade video games was heralded by Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in 1978, which popularized the use of a persistent high score for all players. Several video games in the next several years followed suit, adding other means of tracking high scores such with high score tables that included the players&#x27; initials in games like &quot;Asteroids&quot; in 1979. High score-chasing became a popular activity and a means of competition. The Space Invaders Championship held by Atari in 1980 was the earliest large scale video game competition, attracting more than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing competitive gaming as a mainstream hobby. It was won by Rebecca Heineman. Walter Day, owner of an arcade in Iowa, had taken it upon himself to travel across the United States to record the high scores on various games in 1980, and on his return, founded Twin Galaxies, a high score record-keeping organization. The organization went on to help promote video games and publicize its records through publications such as the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, and in 1983 it created the U.S. National Video Game Team. The team was involved in competitions, such as running the Video Game Masters Tournament for &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; and sponsoring the North American Video Game Challenge tournament. A multicity tour in 1983, the &quot;Electronic Circus&quot;, was used to feature these players in live challenges before audiences, and draw more people to video games. These video game players and tournaments were featured in well-circulated newspapers and popular magazines including &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; and became minor celebrities at the time, such as Billy Mitchell. Besides establishing the competitive nature of games, these types of promotional events all formed the nature of the marketing and promotion that formed the basis of modern esports.

In 1984, Konami and Centuri jointly held an international &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; arcade game competition that drew more than a million players from across Japan and North America. &quot;Play Meter&quot; in 1984 called it &quot;the coin-op event of the year&quot; and an &quot;event on a scale never before achieved in the industry&quot;. , it holds the record for the largest organized video game competition of all time, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

Televised esports events aired during this period included the American show &quot;Starcade&quot; which ran from 1982 to 1984 airing a total of 133 episodes, on which contestants would attempt to beat each other&#x27;s high scores on an arcade game. A video game tournament was included as part of TV show &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot;, and tournaments were also featured as part of the plot of various films, including 1982&#x27;s &quot;Tron&quot;. In the UK, the BBC game show &quot;First Class&quot; included competitive video game rounds featuring the contemporary arcade games, such as &quot;Hyper Sports&quot;, &quot;720°&quot; and &quot;Paperboy&quot;. In the United States, the Amusement Players Association held its first U.S. National Video Game Team competition in January 1987, where &quot;Vs. Super Mario Bros.&quot; was popular among competitive arcade players.

The 1988 game &quot;Netrek&quot; was an Internet game for up to 16 players, written almost entirely in cross-platform open-source software. &quot;Netrek&quot; was the third Internet game, the first Internet game to use metaservers to locate open game servers, and the first to have persistent user information. In 1993 it was credited by &quot;Wired Magazine&quot; as &quot;the first online sports game&quot;.

===Growth and online video games (1990–1999)===

The fighting game &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991) popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition between two players. Previously, video games most often relied on high scores to determine the best player, but this changed with &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, where players would instead challenge each other directly, &quot;face-to-face&quot;, to determine the best player, paving the way for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games. The popularity of fighting games such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; in the 1990s led to the foundation of the international Evolution Championship Series (EVO) esports tournament in 1996.

Large esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, which toured across the United States, and held its finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in California. Nintendo held a 2nd World Championships in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System called the Nintendo PowerFest &#x27;94. There were 132 finalists that played in the finals in San Diego, California. Mike Iarossi took home 1st prize. Blockbuster Video also ran their own World Game Championships in the early 1990s, co-hosted by &quot;GamePro&quot; magazine. Citizens from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Chile were eligible to compete. Games from the 1994 championships included &quot;NBA Jam&quot; and &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;.

Television shows featuring esports during this period include the British shows &quot;GamesMaster&quot; and &quot;Bad Influence!&quot;; the Australian game show &quot;A*mazing&quot;, where in the final round contestants competed in a video game face-off; and the Canadian game show &quot;Video &amp; Arcade Top 10&quot;.

In the 1990s, many games benefited from increasing internet connectivity, especially PC games. Inspired by the fighting games &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, id Software&#x27;s John Romero established competitive multiplayer in online games with &quot;Doom&quot;″s deathmatch mode in 1993. Tournaments established in the late 1990s include the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), QuakeCon, and the Professional Gamers League. PC games played at the CPL included the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; series, &quot;Quake&quot; series, &quot;StarCraft&quot;, and &quot;Warcraft&quot;.

===Global tournaments (2000–present)===

The growth of esports in South Korea is thought to have been influenced by the mass building of broadband Internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for things to do while out of work. Instrumental to this growth of esports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate esports in the country. Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism Park Jie-won coined the term &quot;Esports&quot; at the founding ceremony of the 21st Century Professional Game Association (currently Korean e-Sports Association) in 2000.

&quot;Evo Moment 37&quot;, also known as the &quot;Daigo Parry&quot;, refers to a portion of a &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot; semi-final match held at Evolution Championship Series 2004 (Evo 2004) between Daigo Umehara (playing Ken Masters) and Justin Wong (playing Chun-Li). During this match, Umehara made an unexpected comeback by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong&#x27;s &quot;Super Art&quot; move while having only one pixel of vitality. Umehara subsequently won the match. &quot;Evo Moment #37&quot; is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of competitive video gaming. Being at one point the most-watched competitive gaming moment of all time, it has been compared to sports moments such as Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot and the Miracle on Ice.

In April 2006, the G7 teams federation were formed by seven prominent &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; teams. The goal of the organization was to increase stability in the esports world, particularly in standardizing player transfers and working with leagues and organizations. The founding members were 4Kings, Fnatic, Made in Brazil, Mousesports, NiP, SK-Gaming, and Team 3D. The organization only lasted until 2009 before dissolving.

The 2000s was a popular time for televised esports. Television coverage was best established in South Korea, with &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Warcraft III&quot; competitions regularly televised by dedicated 24-hour cable TV game channels Ongamenet and MBCGame. Elsewhere, esports television coverage was sporadic. The German GIGA Television covered esports until its shutdown in 2009. The United Kingdom satellite television channel XLEAGUE.TV broadcast esports competitions from 2007 to 2009. The online esports only channel ESL TV briefly attempted a paid television model renamed GIGA II from June 2006 to autumn 2007. The French channel Game One broadcast esports matches in a show called &quot;Arena Online&quot; for the Xfire Trophy. The United States channel ESPN2 hosted &quot;Madden NFL&quot; competitions in a show called &quot;Madden Nation&quot; from 2005 to 2008. DirecTV broadcast the Championship Gaming Series tournament for two seasons in 2007 and 2008. CBS aired prerecorded footage of the 2007 World Series of Video Games tournament that was held in Louisville, Kentucky. The G4 television channel originally covered video games exclusively, but broadened its scope to cover technology and men&#x27;s lifestyle, though has now shutdown.

During the 2010s, esports grew tremendously, incurring a large increase in both viewership and prize money. Although large tournaments were founded before the 21st century, the number and scope of tournaments has increased significantly, going from about 10 tournaments in 2000 to about 260 in 2010. Many successful tournaments were founded during this period, including the World Cyber Games, the Intel Extreme Masters, and Major League Gaming. The proliferation of tournaments included experimentation with competitions outside traditional esports genres. For example, the September 2006 FUN Technologies Worldwide Webgames Championship featured 71 contestants competing in casual games for a $1 million grand prize.

The popularity and emergence of online streaming services have helped the growth of esports in this period, and are the most common method of watching tournaments. Twitch, an online streaming platform launched in 2011, routinely streams popular esports competitions. In 2013, viewers of the platform watched 12 billion minutes of video on the service, with the two most popular Twitch broadcasters being &quot;League of Legends&quot; and &quot;Dota 2&quot;. During one day of The International, Twitch recorded 4.5 million unique views, with each viewer watching for an average of two hours.

The modern esports boom has also seen a rise in video games companies embracing the esports potential of their products. After many years of ignoring and at times suppressing the esports scene, Nintendo hosted Wii Games Summer 2010. Spanning over a month, the tournament had over 400,000 participants, making it the largest and most expansive tournament in the company&#x27;s history. In 2014 Nintendo hosted an invitational &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; competitive tournament at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference that was streamed online on Twitch. Halo developers 343 Industries announced in 2014 plans to revive Halo as an esport with the creation of the Halo Championship Series and a prize pool of US$50,000. Both Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have their own collegiate outreach programs with their North American Collegiate Championship. Since 2013 universities and colleges in the United States such as Robert Morris University Illinois and the University of Pikeville have recognized esports players as varsity level athletes and offer athletic scholarships. In 2017, Tespa, Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s collegiate esports division, unveiled its new initiative to provide scholarships and prizes for collegiate esports clubs competing in its tournaments worth US$1 million. Colleges have begun granting scholarships to students who qualify to play esports professionally for the school. Colleges such as Columbia College, Robert Morris University, and Indiana Institute of Technology have taken part in this. In 2018, Harrisburg University of Science and Technology began a tuition scholarship program for esports players.
In 2014, the largest independent esports league, Electronic Sports League, partnered with the local brand Japan Competitive Gaming to try and grow esports in the country.

Physical viewership of esports competitions and the scope of events have increased in tandem with the growth of online viewership. In 2013, the Season 3 League of Legends World Championship was held in a sold-out Staples Center. The 2014 League of Legends World Championship in Seoul, South Korea, had over 40,000 fans in attendance and featured the band Imagine Dragons, and opening and closing ceremonies in addition to the competition.

In 2015, the first Esports Arena was launched in Santa Ana, California, as the United States&#x27; first dedicated esports facility.

The global esports audience reached 662.6 million in 2020, and 921 million in 2022.

In 2021, China announced a law which forbade minors from playing video games, which they described as &quot;spiritual opium&quot;, for more than three hours a week. With China being a large market, the law raised concerns about the future of esports within the country.

==Classification as a sport==

Labeling competitive video games as a sport is a controversial topic. Proponents argue that esports are a fast-growing &quot;non-traditional sport&quot; which requires &quot;careful planning, precise timing, and skillful execution&quot;. Others claim that sports involve physical fitness and physical training, and prefer to classify esports as a mind sport.

Former ESPN president John Skipper described esports in 2014 as a competition and &quot;not a sport&quot;. In 2013 on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic. In addition, many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected esports competitions of other genres. In the 2015 World Championship hosted by the International Esports Federation, an esports panel of guests from international sports society discussed the future recognition of esports as a legitimate sport.

Russia was the first country that classified &quot;cybersport&quot; as an official sport discipline on 25 July 2001. After a series of reforms in Russian sports, it was classified as a sport again on 12 March 2004. In July 2006, it was removed from a list of sport disciplines because it did not fit the new sport standards. On 7 July 2016, The Ministry of Sport decided to add cybersport into the sport registry and on 13 April 2017, esports become an official sport discipline once again.

China was another one of the first countries to recognize esports as a real sport in 2003, despite concerns at the time that video games were addictive. Through this, the government encouraged esports, stating that by participating in esports, players were also &quot;training the body for China&quot;. Furthermore, by early 2019, China recognized esports players as an official profession within the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security&#x27;s Occupation Skill Testing Authority recommendations, as well as professional gaming operators, those that distribute and manage esports games. By July 2019, more than 100,000 people had registered themselves as professional gamers under this, with the Ministry stating that they anticipate over 2 million such people in this profession in five years.

In 2013, Canadian &quot;League of Legends&quot; player Danny &quot;Shiphtur&quot; Le became the first pro gamer to receive an American P-1A visa, a category designated for &quot;Internationally Recognized Athletes&quot;. In 2014, Turkey&#x27;s Ministry of Youth and Sports started issuing esports licenses to players certified as professionals. In 2016, the French government started working on a project to regulate and recognize esports. The Games and Amusements Board of the Philippines started issuing athletic licenses to Filipino esports players who are vouched for by a professional esports team in July 2017.

To help promote esports as a legitimate sport, several esports events have been run alongside more traditional international sports competitions. The 2007 Asian Indoor Games was the first notable multi-sport competition including esports as an official medal-winning event, alongside other traditional sports, and the later editions of the Asian Indoor Games, as well as its successor the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, have always included esports as an official medal event or an exhibition event up to now. Moreover, the Asian Games, which is the Asian top-level multi-sport competition, also included esports as a medal event at the 2022 edition; esports around games such as &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, &quot;Starcraft II&quot;, and &quot;League of Legends&quot; were presented as an exhibition event at the 2018 Asian Games as a lead-in to the 2022 games. The 2019 Southeast Asian Games included six medal events for esports. Since 2018, World Sailing has held an eSailing World Championship that showed a main sports federation embracing esports. The Virtual Regatta race shadowing the 2020-2021 Vendee Globe was the first online game believe to have in excess of 1,000,000 unique users

Ahead of The International 2021, which was originally set to take place in Stockholm in 2020, the Swedish Sports Confederation voted in June 2021 to deny recognition of esports as a sporting event, which jeopardized plans for how Valve had arranged the event in regards to travel visas for international players. Valve had tried to work with Sweden to accommodate players, but eventually rescheduled the event to Romania instead.

The 2022 Commonwealth Games featured esports competitions as a pilot ahead of being a potential full medal event for 2026.

In Greece, in March 2022 a law entered into force recognising and regulating esports and in June 2023, the relevant federation for esports has been officially given recognition and included in the list of sports federations.

===Olympic Games recognition===
The Olympic Games are also seen as a potential method to legitimize esports. A summit held by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2017 acknowledged the growing popularity of esports, concluding that &quot;Competitive &#x27;esports&#x27; could be considered as a sporting activity, and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports&quot; but would require any games used for the Olympics fitting &quot;with the rules and regulations of the Olympic movement&quot;. Another article by Andy Stout suggests that 106 million people viewed the 2017 Worlds Esports competition. International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has noted that the IOC is troubled by violent games and the lack of a global sanctioning body for esports. Bach acknowledged that many Olympic sports originated from violent combat, but stated that &quot;sport is the civilized expression about this. If you have egames where it&#x27;s about killing somebody, this cannot be brought into line with our Olympic values.&quot; Due to that, the IOC suggested that they would approve more esports centered around games that simulate real sports, such as the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; or &quot;FIFA&quot; series.

The issues around esports have not prevented the IOC from exploring what possibilities there are for incorporation into future Olympics. In July 2018, the IOC and the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) held a symposium and invited major figures in esports, including Epic Games&#x27; Mark Rein, Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s Mike Morhaime, and esports players Dario &quot;TLO&quot; Wünsch, Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Lyon, and Se-yeon &quot;Geguri&quot; Kim, for these organizations &quot;to gain a deeper understanding of esports, their impact and likely future development, so that [they] can jointly consider the ways in which [they] may collaborate to the mutual benefit of all of sport in the years ahead&quot;. The IOC has tested the potential for esports through exhibition games. With support from the IOC, Intel sponsored exhibition esports events for &quot;StarCraft II&quot; and &quot;Steep&quot; prior to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, and five South Korean esports players were part of the Olympic Torch relay. A similar exhibition showcase, the eGames, was held alongside the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, though this was not supported by the IOC.

During the Eighth Olympic Summit in December 2019, the IOC reiterated that it would only consider sports-simulating games for any official Olympic event, but it would look at two paths for such games in the future: those that promoted good physical and mental health lifestyles, and virtual reality and augmented reality games that included physical activity.

In the late 2010s, leaders in Japan became involved in helping bring esports to the 2020 Summer Olympics and beyond, given the country&#x27;s reputation as a major video game industry centre. Esports in Japan had not flourished due to the country&#x27;s anti-gambling laws that also prevent paid professional gaming tournaments, but there were efforts starting in late 2017 to eliminate this issue. At the suggestion of the Tokyo Olympic Games Committee for the 2020 Summer Olympics, four esports organizations have worked with Japan&#x27;s leading consumer organization to exempt esports tournaments from gambling law restrictions. Takeo Kawamura, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, led a coalition of ruling and opposing politicians to support esports, called the Japan esports Union, or JeSU. Kawamura said that they would be willing to pass laws to further exempt esports as needed so that esports athletes can make a living playing these sports. So far, this has resulted in the ability of esports players to obtain exemption licenses to allow them to play, a similar mechanism needed for professional athletes in other sports in Japan to play professionally. The first such licenses were given out in mid-July 2018, via a tournament held by several video game publishers to award prizes to many players but with JeSU offering these exemption licenses to the top dozen or so players that emerge, allowing them to compete in further esports events. The Tokyo Olympic Committee has also planned to arrange a number of esports events leading up to the 2020 games. With the IOC, five esports events were set as part of an Olympic Virtual Series from 13 May to 23 June 2021, ahead of the games. Each event in auto racing, baseball, cycling, rowing and sailing will be managed by an IOC-recognized governing body for the sport along with a video game publisher of a game for that sport. For example, the auto racing event will be based on the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series and overseen by the International Automobile Federation along with Polyphony Digital. The baseball, cycling, and esailing events will be based on &quot;eBaseball Powerful Pro Baseball 2020&quot;, &quot;Zwift&quot;, and &quot;Virtual Regatta&quot;, respectively.

The organization committee for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris were in discussions with the IOC and the various professional esports organizations to consider esports for the event, citing the need to include these elements to keep the Olympics relevant to younger generations. Ultimately, the organization committee determined esports were premature to bring to the 2024 Games as medal events, but have not ruled out other activities related to esports during the Games.

In September 2021, the Olympic Council of Asia announced eight esports games will officially debut as medal sports for the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.

In December 2021, the IOC confirmed its Olympic Virtual Series (OVS) will return in 2022. The first edition of the OVS which ran from 13 May to 23 June, featured nearly 250,000 participants and had more than two million entries.

In January 2022, the IOC announced the appointment of the organization&#x27;s first ever head of virtual sport, tasked with the development of virtual sport for the global Olympic body, increasing the organization&#x27;s engagement with gaming communities, and overseeing the Olympic Virtual Series, IOC&#x27;s first licensed non-physical sports event. The inaugural series included virtual baseball, cycling, rowing, esailing and motorsports events.

In February 2022, the Commonwealth Games Federation announced that esports would be included in the 2022 Commonwealth Games as a pilot event, with the possibility of it being a medal event in the 2026 Games. The inaugural Commonwealth Esports Championship had separate branding, medals, and organization and included both men and women&#x27;s &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;eFootball&quot;, and &quot;Rocket League&quot; events.

As a follow-up to 2021&#x27;s Olympic Virtual Series, the IOC and the Singapore National Olympic Council held the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in Singapore in June 2023. Games featured at the event included:
* &quot;Tic Tac Bow&quot; (archery)
* &quot;WBSC eBaseball: Power Pros&quot; (baseball)
* Chess.com (chess)
* &quot;Zwift&quot; (cycling)
* &quot;Just Dance&quot; (dancing)
* &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; (motor sport)
* &quot;Virtual Regatta&quot; (esailing)
* &quot;Fortnite&quot; (sharpshooting)
* &quot;Virtual Taekwondo&quot; (taekwondo)
* &quot;Tennis Clash&quot; (tennis)

In June 2024, the IOC Executive Board announced the proposal to establish the Olympic Esports Games during the 142nd IOC Session held prior to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, with the inaugural event to take place in 2025 at Saudi Arabia following a new partnership with their National Olympic Committee, later rescheduled for 2027. The proposal was ultimately approved by a unanimous vote on 23 July 2024.

==Games==
A number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, real-time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet cafés, with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though the most popular games as of the early 2020s are &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;Fortnite&quot;, &quot;Rocket League&quot;, &quot;Valorant&quot;, &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, &quot;StarCraft II&quot; and &quot;Overwatch&quot;. &quot;&quot; has also popularized the digital collectible card game (DCCG) genre since its release in 2014.

==Video game design==
While it is common for video games to be designed with the experience of the player in game being the only priority, many successful esports games have been designed to be played professionally from the beginning. Developers may decide to add dedicated esports features, or even make design compromises to support high level competition. Games such as &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, and &quot;Dota 2&quot; have all been designed, at least in part, to support professional competition.

===Spectator mode===
In addition to allowing players to participate in a given game, many game developers have added dedicated observing features for the benefit of spectators. This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player&#x27;s point of view, to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have. The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage. Games with these features include &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, and &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. &quot;League of Legends&quot; includes spectator features, which are restricted to custom game modes.

In response to the release of virtual reality headsets in 2016, some games, such as &quot;Dota 2&quot;, were updated to include virtual reality spectating support.

===Online===
A very common method for connection is the Internet. Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players to set up real-time connections across the world. Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting cheating compared to physical events, and greater network latency, which can negatively impact players&#x27; performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and exhibition games.

Since the 1990s, professional teams or organized clans have set up matches via Internet Relay Chat networks such as QuakeNet. As esports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.net, which has been integrated into both the &quot;Warcraft&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot; series. Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a game server, either remotely to each of the competitors, or running on one of the competitor&#x27;s machines.

===Local area network===
Additionally, competitions are also often conducted over a local area network or LAN. The smaller network usually has very little lag and higher quality. Because competitors must be physically present, LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors. This helps prevent many forms of cheating, such as unauthorized hardware or software modding. The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events. Many gamers organize LAN parties or visit Internet cafés, and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs.

Individual games have taken various approaches to LAN support. In contrast to the original &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;StarCraft II&quot; was released without support for LAN play, drawing some strongly negative reactions from players. &quot;League of Legends&quot; was originally released for online play only, but announced in October 2012 that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments. In September 2013, Valve added general support for LAN play to &quot;Dota 2&quot; in a patch for the game.

==Players and teams==

=== General players and teams ===
Professional gamers are often associated with esports teams or broader gaming and entertainment organizations. Teams such as FaZe Clan, Cloud9, Fnatic, T1, G2 Esports, and Natus Vincere have become successful within esports and now sponsor esports players around the world. These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games within Evolution Championship Series, or &quot;Hearthstone&quot; tournaments. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware. Prominent esports sponsors include companies such as Logitech and Razer. Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys and on their social media, in 2016 the biggest teams have social media followings of over a million. Associations include the Korea e-Sports Association (KeSPA), the International Esports Federation (IESF), the British Esports Federation, and the World Esports Association (WESA).

Some traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, such as Rick Fox&#x27;s ownership of Echo Fox, Jeremy Lin&#x27;s ownership of Team VGJ, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s investment in NRG Esports. Some association football teams, such as FC Schalke 04 in Germany, Paris Saint-Germain in France; Beşiktaş J.K., Fenerbahçe S.K., and Galatasaray S.K. in Turkey; Panathinaikos F.C. in Greece either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams.

Competitive esports tournaments in the most popular games pay hundreds to thousands of dollars to players for winning tournaments. &quot;Dota 2&quot;″s 2021 tournament The International had a prize pool over $40 million, the largest in esports history, thanks to its Compendium battle pass contributing a portion of its sales to it. &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; had a total 2021 prize pool, across all tournaments, of around $22 million. The current biggest esports tournament by prize pool, the King Pro League Grand Finals for &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, provides just under US$10 million for the twelve teams that take part. However, financial security in the industry is largely limited to players in top performing teams. One study found that only 1 in 5 professional gamers have careers that last longer than two years. Team rosters are extremely volatile, sometimes changing players or rosters within a season.

While different from the regimens of traditional sports, esports athletes still have extensive training routines. Team Liquid&#x27;s professional &quot;League of Legends&quot; team practices for a minimum of 50 hours per week and most play the game far more. In April 2020, researchers from the Queensland University of Technology found that some of the top esports players showed similar aspects of mental toughness as Olympic athletes. This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age. Players are generally in competition by their mid- to late-teens, with most retiring by their late-20s.

=== Unique players and teams ===
There is a long history of different esports teams or certain players in leagues that aren&#x27;t exactly the same as most players. For example, there are many esports organizations or teams that are entirely made up of players that have physical disabilities. Permastunned and ParaEsports are great examples of this where ParaEsports is completely composed of professional &quot;CS:GO&quot; players that have cerebral palsy. Whilst these teams aren&#x27;t in many cases very successful in the major leagues of their respective esports, there are certain leagues or tournaments that are restricted to only have teams or players like these be able to compete. Although these teams or tournaments don&#x27;t get nearly as much attention, budget, or prize pool as the main leagues of popular esports, it is still important to recognize these amazing players that have overcome their unfortunate positions and strive to succeed.

==Leagues and tournaments==
=== Promotion and relegation leagues ===
In most team-based esports, organized play is centered around the use of promotion and relegation to move sponsored teams between leagues within the competition&#x27;s organization based on how the team fared in matches; this follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries. Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season. Those that do well, in addition to prize money, may be promoted into a higher-level league, while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward. For example, until 2018 Riot Games ran several &quot;League of Legends&quot; series, with the League of Legends Championship Series being the top-tier series. Teams that did not do well were relegated to the League of Legends Challenger Series, replaced by the better performing teams from that series. This format was discontinued when Riot opted to use the franchise format in mid-2018, but the promotion and relegation format still exists within Southeast Asia&#x27;s Pacific Championship Series and in North America&#x27;s new tier 2 league, the North American Challengers Series, as of 2024.

=== Franchised leagues ===

With rising interest in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the franchise approach used in North American professional sports, in which all teams, backed by a major financial sponsor to support the franchise, participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post-season games. This approach is more attractive for larger investors, who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the esport&#x27;s premiere league and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing. Though the details vary from league to league, these leagues generally require all signed player to have a minimum salary with appropriate benefits, and may share in the team&#x27;s winnings. While there is no team promotion or relegation, players can be signed onto contracts, traded among teams, or let go as free agents, and new players may be pulled from the esports&#x27; equivalent minor league.

The first such league to be formed was the Overwatch League, established by Blizzard Entertainment in 2016 based on its &quot;Overwatch&quot; game. Initially launched in 2018 with 12 teams, the league expanded to twenty teams in 2019. Though the first two seasons were played at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, the Overwatch League&#x27;s third season in 2020 will implement the typical home/away game format at esports arenas in the teams&#x27; various home cities or regions. The OWL would fold in 2023 and would be replaced by a more open esports structure for Overwatch known as the Overwatch Champions Series.

Take-Two Interactive partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA) to create the NBA 2K League, using the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; game series. It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional sports league, and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the 30 professional NBA teams. Its inaugural season started in May 2018 with 17 teams and the league has since expanded to 25 teams, including teams owned by Gen.G and Australia&#x27;s National Basketball League.

Similar to the NBA 2K League, EA Sports and Major League Soccer (MLS) established the eMLS in 2018, a league using EA&#x27;s &quot;FIFA&quot; (Now known as EA Sports FC) series. EA would later establish esports leagues with other professional football leagues, ranging from the English Premier League to the Saudi Pro League, which would feed into qualification for the FIFAe World Cup and later the EA Sports FC Pro World Championship.

Activision launched its 12-team Call of Duty League in January 2020, following the format of the Overwatch League but based on the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series.

Cloud9 and Dignitas, among others, developed a franchise-based &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; league, Flashpoint, in February 2020. This was the first such esports league to be owned by the teams rather than any single organization. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications, Flashpoint would be discontinued by 2022.

===Tournaments===
Esports are also frequently played in tournaments, where potential players and teams vie to be placed through qualification matches before entering the tournament. From there, the tournament formats can vary from single or double elimination, sometimes hybridized with group stage. Esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience, with referees or officials to monitor for cheating. The tournament may be part of a larger gathering, such as Dreamhack, or the competition may be the entirety of the event, like the World Cyber Games or the Fortnite World Cup. Esports competitions have also become a popular feature at gaming and multi-genre conventions.

Although competitions involving video games have long existed, esports underwent a significant transition in the late 1990s. Beginning with the Cyberathlete Professional League in 1997, tournaments became much larger, and corporate sponsorship became more common. Increasing viewership both in person and online brought esports to a wider audience. Major tournaments include the World Cyber Games, the North American Major League Gaming league, the France-based Electronic Sports World Cup, and the World e-Sports Games held in Hangzhou, China.

The average compensation for professional esports players does not compare to those of the top classical sports organizations in the world. According to Julian Krinsky Camps &amp; Programs website, the top Esports player in the world earned around $2.5 million in 2017. The highest overall salary by any esports professional at the time was around $3.6 million. While prizes for esports competitions can be very large, the limited number of competitions and large number of competitors ultimately lowers the amount of money one can make in the industry. In the United States, Esports competitions have prizes that can reach $200,000 for a single victory. Dota 2 International hosted a competition where the grand-prize winning team walked home with almost $10.9 million.

For well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of U.S. dollars a year. As of 10 September 2016, &quot;Dota 2&quot; has awarded approximately US$86 million in prize money within 632 registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million. &quot;League of Legends&quot; awarded approximately $30 million within 1749 registered tournaments, but in addition to the prize money, Riot Games provides salaries for players within their &quot;League of Legends&quot; Championship Series. Nonetheless, there has been criticism to how these salaries are distributed, since most players earn a fairly low wage but a few top players have a significantly higher salary, skewing the average earning per player. In August 2018, The International 2018, Valve&#x27;s annual premier &quot;Dota 2&quot; tournament, was held and broke the record for holding the largest prize pool to date for any esports tournament, amounting to over US$25 million.

Often, game developers provide prize money for tournament competition directly, but sponsorship may also come from third parties, typically companies selling computer hardware, energy drinks, or computer software. Generally, hosting a large esports event is not profitable as a stand-alone venture. For example, Riot has stated that their headline &quot;League of Legends&quot; Championship Series is &quot;a significant investment that we&#x27;re not making money from&quot;.

There is considerable variation and negotiation over the relationship between video game developers and tournament organizers and broadcasters. While the original &quot;StarCraft&quot; events emerged in South Korea largely independently of Blizzard, the company decided to require organizers and broadcasters to authorize events featuring the sequel &quot;StarCraft II&quot;. In the short term, this led to a deadlock with the Korean e-Sports Association. An agreement was reached in 2012. Blizzard requires authorization for tournaments with more than US$10,000 in prizes. Riot Games offers in-game rewards to authorized tournaments.

===University and school leagues===
The increasing popularity of esports brought with it a demand for extended opportunities for esports athletes. Esports clubs grew in popularity at American universities in the late 2000s and early 2010s, with &quot;StarCraft&quot; clubs competing by 2009. Universities, particularly in China and America, then began offering scholarship opportunities to incoming students to join collegiate esports teams. The first officially recognized varsity esports program was created at Robert Morris University in 2014. around 125 US colleges had esports-based varsity programs. Most of these are members of the National Association of Collegiate Esports.

The UK&#x27;s National University Esports League (NUEL) started in 2010. In 2023, it was taken over by Spanish Esports company GGTech Entertainment. it had been rebranded as University Esports UK &amp; Ireland and had over 110 participating universities. Another university competition in the UK is the British Universities Esports Championship, run by National Student Esports (NSE), which also had over 110 participating universities and colleges . The University of Warwick won its sixth consecutive NES Esports University of the Year title in 2024. The two organisations are not exclusive, with universities able to field teams in both NUEL and NSE competitions. For younger students, the British Esports Student Champs had over 1,250 teams from over 200 schools and colleges . Collegiate universities such as Durham and multi-campus universities such as Staffordshire also hold inter-collegiate or inter-campus tournaments.

According to Schaeperkoetter and collaborators in 2017, the potential impact of esports programs on universities, coupled with the growing interest that universities were showing in such programs, combined to make esports a relevant line of research in sport literature.

===Governing bodies===

While game publishers or esports broadcasters typically act in oversight roles for specific esports, a number of esports governing bodies have been established to collectively represent esports on a national, regional or global basis. These governing bodies may have various levels of involvement with the esport, from being part of esports regulation to simply acting more as a trade group and public face for esports.

The International Esports Federation (IESF) was one of the first such bodies. Originally formed in 2008 to help promote esports in the Southeast Asian region, it has grown to include over 140 member countries from across the globe. The IESF has managed annual World Esports Championships for teams from its member countries across multiple games.

The European Esports Federation was formed in April 2019 and includes UK, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Russia, Slovenia, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine. This body was designed more to be a managing partner for other esports, working to coordinate event structures and regulations across multiple esports.

Additionally, trade groups representing video games have also generally acted as governing bodies for esports. Notably, in November 2019, five major national trade organizations – the Entertainment Software Association in the United States, the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment, Interactive Software Federation of Europe, and the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association of Australian and New Zealand – issued a joined statement for supporting the promotion and participation of esports to respect player safety and integrity, respect and diversity among players, and enriching game play.

==Criticisms and legal problems==

=== Health concerns ===
Most esports generally require participants to sit and/or move little while playing, which raises concerns about a sedentary lifestyle by players. A research led by Ingo Froböse, a professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, for over eight years found professional and also amateur esports gamers play on average 24–25 hours per week and even physical activities after hours of playing are not able to compensate the damage of oversitting. Players in China may train for almost 14 hours a day. A study conducted in 2022 of &quot;CS:GO&quot; players found that total hours played were about 31.2 hours each week. Sitting for long periods at a computer could lead to eye fatigue and lower back pain from poor posture. Gamers with poor posture sit in forward head posture which can cause symptoms such as decreased arm or shoulder mobility and tension headaches. These sedentary behaviors of sitting for too long concerns public health researchers because spending more than 6–8 hours per day has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. As a result, teams like T1 have partnered with Nike to encourage exercise and provide training that helps improve gaming skills. Recent research has also shown that structured esports activities can foster teamwork, problem-solving skills, and promote digital literacy among participants, though concerns about sedentary behavior and mental health risks persist.

In addition to sedentary behaviors, players&#x27; mental health is a concern for scientists. One study found that competitors in esports are often under psychological and physical stress, and the amateur ones are the most affected, since they frequently aim at greater wins without enough preparation, though no clear training guidelines are set to become professional players. Researchers have found that high levels of stress lead to mental illness and poor decision making. The Esports sector has a high rate of burnout due to mental health and stress. A study found a correlation between depression and training time leading to sleep disturbances. Teams are starting to incorporate mental health support for players. Misfits has hired a psychologist to ensure players are equipped with methods to deal with stress and anxiety.

===Ethical issues===
Esports athletes are usually obligated to behave ethically, abiding by both the explicit rules set out by tournaments, associations, and teams, as well as following general expectations of good sportsmanship. For example, it is common practice and considered good etiquette to send a &quot;gg&quot; (good game) message to opponents when defeated. Many games rely on competitors having limited information about the game state. In a prominent example of good conduct, during a 2012 IEM &quot;StarCraft II&quot; game, players Feast and DeMusliM voluntarily offered information about their strategies to negate the influence of outside information inadvertently leaked to Feast during the game. Players in some leagues have been reprimanded for failing to meet expectations of good behavior. In 2012, professional &quot;League of Legends&quot; player Christian &quot;IWillDominate&quot; Riviera was banned from competing for one year following a history of verbal abuse. In 2013, &quot;StarCraft II&quot; progamer Greg &quot;Idra&quot; Fields was fired from Evil Geniuses for insulting his fans on the Team Liquid internet forums. &quot;League of Legends&quot; players Mithy and Nukeduck received similar penalties in 2014 after behaving in a &quot;toxic&quot; manner during matches.

The formation of Team Siren, an all-female &quot;League of Legends&quot; team, in June 2013 was met with controversy and dismissed as a &quot;gimmick&quot; to attract men&#x27;s attention. The team disbanded within a month due to negative publicity from their promotional video and the team captain&#x27;s poor attitude towards her teammates. In 2018, Team Vaevictis attempted to field an all-female roster in the LCL, the top esports league in Russia, but faced similar criticism. Vaevictis went 0–14 in both splits, and in February 2020, the LCL announced their disbandment due to a failure to field a competitive roster. The LCL stated, &quot;The results of the 2019 season showed a huge difference in Vaevictis Esports&#x27; results compared to other LCL teams, which is an unacceptable level of competitiveness in a franchised league.&quot;

There have been serious rule violations in certain esports. In 2010, eleven &quot;StarCraft: Brood War&quot; players were found guilty of fixing matches for profit and were fined and banned from future competition. Team Curse and Team Dignitas were denied prize money for collusion during the 2012 MLG Summer Championship. In 2012, &quot;League of Legends&quot; team Azubu Frost was fined US$30,000 for cheating during a semifinal match of the world playoffs. &quot;Dota 2&quot; player Aleksey &quot;Solo&quot; Berezin was suspended from several tournaments for intentionally throwing a game to collect $322 from online gambling. In 2014, four high-profile North American &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; players from iBuyPower were suspended from official tournaments after being found guilty of match-fixing, allegedly profiting over US$10,000 through betting on their fixed matches. Gambling on esports using &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offense&quot; &quot;skins&quot;, worth an estimated US$2.3 billion in 2015, came under criticism in June and July 2016 after several questionable legal and ethical aspects were discovered.

===Performance-enhancing drugs===

Reports of widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in esports are not uncommon, with players discussing their own, their teammates&#x27; and their competitors&#x27; use as well as officials acknowledging the prevalence of the issue. Players often turn to stimulants such as Ritalin, Adderall and Vyvanse, drugs which can significantly boost concentration, improve reaction time, and prevent fatigue. Selegiline, a drug used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease, is reportedly popular, because like stimulants, it enhances mood and motivation. Conversely, drugs with calming effects are also sought after. Some players take propranolol, which blocks the effects of adrenaline, or Valium, which is prescribed to treat anxiety disorder, in order to remain calm under pressure. According to Bjoern Franzen, a former SK Gaming executive, it is second nature for some &quot;League of Legends&quot; players to take as many as three different drugs before competition. In July 2015 Kory &quot;Semphis&quot; Friesen, an ex-Cloud9 player, admitted that he and his teammates were all using Adderall during a match against Virtus.pro in the ESL One Katowice 2015 &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; tournament, and went on to claim that &quot;everyone&quot; at ESEA League tournaments uses Adderall. In 2020, former Call of Duty champion Adam &quot;KiLLa&quot; Sloss told The Washington Post that one of the major reasons he stopped competing in esports was the &quot;rampant&quot; use of Adderall in the competitive scene.

The unregulated use of such drugs poses severe risks to competitors&#x27; health, including addiction, overdose, serotonin syndrome and, in the case of stimulants, weight loss. Accordingly, Adderall and other such stimulants are banned and their use penalized by many professional sporting bodies and leagues, including Major League Baseball and the National Football League. Although International e-Sports Federation (IeSF) is a signatory of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the governing body has not outlawed any PEDs in its sanctioned competitions. Action has been taken on the individual league level, however, as at least one major league, the Electronic Sports League, has made use of any drugs during matches punishable by expulsion from competition. Although not all players use drugs, the use of over-the-counter energy drinks is common. These energy drinks are often marketed specifically toward gamers, and have also faced media and regulatory scrutiny due to their health risks.

===Player exploitation===
There has been some concern over the quality of life and potential mistreatment of players by organizations, especially in South Korea. Korean organizations have been accused of refusing to pay competitive salaries, leading to a slow exodus of Korean players to other markets. In an interview, &quot;League of Legends&quot; player Bae &quot;Dade&quot; Eo-jin said that &quot;Korean players wake up at 1 pm and play until 5 am&quot;, and suggested that the 16-hour play schedule was a significant factor in causing burnout. Concerns over the mental health of players intensified in 2014 when &quot;League of Legends&quot; player Cheon &quot;Promise&quot; Min-Ki attempted suicide a week after admitting to match fixing.

To combat the negative environment, Korean &quot;League of Legends&quot; teams were given new rules for the upcoming 2015 season by Riot Games, including the adoption of minimum salaries for professional players, requiring contracts and allowing players to stream individually for additional player revenue.

Since esports games often requires many actions per minute, some players may get repetitive strain injuries, causing hand or wrist pain. During the early development of the esports industry, sports medicine and gaming-related injuries were ignored by players and organizations, leading to some early player retirements.

===Economics===
The &quot;League of Legends&quot; Championship Series and &quot;League of Legends&quot; Champions Korea offer guaranteed salaries for players. Despite this, online streaming is preferred by some players, as in some cases, streaming can be more profitable than competing with a team, and streamers have the ability to determine their own schedule. The International tournament awards US$10 million to the winners, however teams that do not have the same amount of success often do not have financial stability and frequently break up after failing to win.

In 2015 it was estimated by SuperData Research, that the global esports industry generated revenue of around US$748.8 million that year. Asia is the leading esports market with over $321 million in revenue, with North America at around $224 million, and Europe at $172 million. For comparison, the rest of the world combines for approximately $29 million. Global esports revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the video gaming industry bypassed many economic sectors by providing a means of compensating for the physical isolation imposed by the lockdown, transforming it into an increasingly important economic sector within the global economy.

The number of female viewers has been growing in esports, with an estimated 30% of esports viewers being female in 2013, a significant increase from 15% the previous year. However, despite the increase in female viewers, there is not a growth of female players in high level competitive esports. The top female players that are involved in esports mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, most notably &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot;, and &quot;StarCraft II&quot;. Current all-female esports teams include Frag Dolls and PMS Clan.

===Gambling===
Gambling on esports matches have historically been illegal or unregulated by major markets. This created a black market via virtual currency. In places where esports gambling is not officially recognized, the lack of regulation has resulted in match-fixing by players or third parties, and created issues with underage gambling due to the draw of video games. Some games allow bets in their in-game currency, while third-party gambling platforms will often take bets placed using virtual items earned in games. In esports gambling, most bets and odds are structured in the same way as traditional sports. Most gambling sites offering the booker service allow users to bet based on the outcome of tournaments, matches or special esports titles. On the other hand, due to the nature of esports, there are numerous innovative ways to make bets, which are based on in-game milestones. For example, League of Legend bettors may place their money on which team/champion will take the &quot;First Blood&quot;.

Esports gambling in the United States has been illegal under the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA). The Act prevented all but five states from allowing gambling on sporting events. However, regulation of esports betting still depended on state law. Some betting houses in Nevada, where sports betting has been already exempted under PASPA, classify esports as non-competitive &quot;other events&quot; similar to the selection of the Heisman Trophy winner or NFL Draft which are considered as legal. Other companies established in the United States allow betting on esports to international users but are restricted to Americans. Nevada legalized esports gambling in June 2017, classifying esports along with competitive sports and dog racing. With the Supreme Court of the United States&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot; in May 2018, PASPA was recognized as unconstitutional, as the Court claimed that the federal government cannot limit states from regulating sports betting. This created the potential for legalized esports-based betting in the United States. However, New Jersey, the state at the center of the Supreme Court case, passed its bill to legalize sports gambling but restricted gambling on esports to only international competitions where most players are over 18 years of age. Without PASPA, interstate gambling on esports would be still be limited by the Federal Wire Act, preventing users from betting on national esports events outside of the state.

In 2019, the countries where esports gambling is legal include the UK, New Zealand, Australia, China, Spain, Canada, South Korea, and Japan, and many of them are the international hosts for gaming tournaments. By the end of 2019, the state of New Jersey approved esports betting, just in time for the finals of the LoL Worlds Cup 2019 final match, which had over 4.000.000 spectators.

The esports gambling industry has attracted criticism because of its target audience. As a large part of the esports audience is underage, governments and regulators have expressed skepticism regarding the market and the possibility of underage gambling. Additionally, gambling platforms have received criticism for their integration with the larger esports industry. Esports platforms regularly sponsor professional esports teams, as happened with the contract between Betway and PSG.LGD team (Dota 2) in August 2019.

===Data analytics and machine learning===
With the growing popularity of machine learning in data analytics, esports has been the focus of several software programs that analyze the plethora of game data available. Based on the huge number of matches played on a daily basis globally (League of Legends alone had a reported 100 million active monthly players worldwide in 2016 and an average of 27 million League of Legends games played per day reported in 2014), these games can be used for applying big-data machine learning platforms. Several games make their data publicly available, so websites aggregate the data into easy-to-visualize graphs and statistics. In addition, several programs use machine learning tools to predict the win probability of a match based on various factors, such as team composition. In 2018, the DotA team Team Liquid partnered with a software company to allow players and coaches to predict the team&#x27;s success rate in each match and provide advice on what needs to be changed to improve performance.

===Game cancellations===
As more esports competitions and leagues are run entirely or in portion by the video game publisher or developer for the game, the ongoing viability of that game&#x27;s esports activities is tied to that company. In December 2018, Blizzard announced that it was reducing resources spent on the development of &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; and canceling its plans for tournaments in 2019. This caused several professional &quot;Heroes&quot; players and coaches to recognize that their career was no longer viable, and expressed outrage and disappointment at Blizzard&#x27;s decision.

==Media coverage==
===News reporting===
The main medium for esports coverage is the Internet. In the mid-2010s, mainstream sports and news reporting websites, such as &quot;ESPN&quot;, &quot;Yahoo!&quot;, &quot;Sport1&quot;, &quot;Kicker&quot;, and &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; started dedicated esports coverage. esports tournaments commonly use commentators or casters to provide live commentary of games in progress, similar to a traditional sports commentator. For popular casters, providing commentary for esports can be a full-time position by itself. Prominent casters for &quot;StarCraft II&quot; include Dan &quot;Artosis&quot; Stemkoski and Nick &quot;Tasteless&quot; Plott. However, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic affected how esports were covered in addition to the sports themselves. Notably, &quot;ESPN&quot; dedicated esports coverage was shuttered in November 2020 as the network refocus on more traditional sports, though said they would still have some coverage of esports events.

In 2018, the Associated Press&#x27; AP Stylebook officially began spelling the word as &quot;esports&quot;, dropping support for both the capital &quot;S&quot; and the dash between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;sports&quot; styles, similar to how &quot;e-mail&quot; transformed with common usage to &quot;email&quot;. Richard Tyler Blevins, better known as &quot;Ninja&quot;, became the first professional gamer to appear in a cover story for a major sports magazine when he appeared in the September 2018 issue of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;.

===Internet live streaming===

Many esports events are streamed online to viewers over the internet. With the shutdown of the Own3d streaming service in 2013, Twitch is by far the most popular streaming service for esports, competing against other providers such as Hitbox.tv, Azubu, and YouTube Gaming. Dreamhack Winter 2011 reached 1.7 million unique viewers on Twitch. While coverage of live events usually brings in the largest viewership counts, the recent popularization of streaming services has allowed individuals to broadcast their own gameplay independent of such events as well. Individual broadcasters can enter an agreement with Twitch or Hitbox in which they receive a portion of the advertisement revenue from commercials which run on the stream they create.

Another major streaming platform was Major League Gaming&#x27;s MLG.tv. The network, which specializes in &quot;Call of Duty&quot; content but hosts a range of gaming titles, has seen increasing popularity, with 1376% growth in MLG.tv viewership in Q1 of 2014. The 2014 &quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot; broadcast at MLG&#x27;s X Games event drew over 160,000 unique viewers. The network, like Twitch, allows users to broadcast themselves playing games, though only select individuals can use the service. For several years, MLG.tv was the primary streaming platform for the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; professional scene; famous players such as NaDeSHoT and Scump have signed contracts with the company to use its streaming service exclusively. In January 2016, MLG was acquired by Activision Blizzard.

YouTube also relaunched its livestreaming platform with a renewed focus on live gaming and esports specifically. For The International 2014, coverage was also simulcast on ESPN&#x27;s streaming service ESPN3. In December 2016, Riot Games announced a deal with MLB Advanced Media&#x27;s technology division BAM Tech for the company to distribute and monetize broadcasts of &quot;League of Legends&quot; events through 2023. BAM Tech will pay Riot at least $300 million per-year, and split advertising revenue.

===Television===
Especially since the popularization of streaming in esports, organizations no longer prioritize television coverage, preferring online streaming websites such as Twitch. Ongamenet continues to broadcast as an esports channel in South Korea, but MBCGame was taken off the air in 2012. Riot Games&#x27; Dustin Beck stated that &quot;TV&#x27;s not a priority or a goal&quot;, and DreamHack&#x27;s Tomas Hermansson said &quot;esports have [been proven] to be successful on internet streaming [services].&quot;

On the night before the finals of The International 2014 in August, ESPN3 broadcast a half-hour special profiling the tournament. In 2015, ESPN2 broadcast &quot;Heroes of the Dorm&quot;, the grand finals of the &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; collegiate tournament. The first-place team from the University of California, Berkeley received tuition for each of the team&#x27;s players, paid for by Blizzard and Tespa. The top four teams won gaming equipment and new computers. This was the first time an esport had ever been broadcast on a major American television network. The broadcast was an attempt to broaden the appeal of esports by reaching viewers who would not normally come across it. However, the broadcast was met with a few complaints. Those living outside of the United States were unable to view the tournament. Additionally, the tournament could not be viewed online via streams, cutting off a large portion of viewers from the main demographic in the process.

In September 2015, Turner Broadcasting partnered with WME/IMG. In December 2015, the partnered companies announced two seasons of the ELeague, a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league based in North America including 15 teams from across the world competing for a $1,200,000 prize pool each 10-week season. The tournament, filmed at Turner&#x27;s studios in Atlanta, Georgia, was simultaneously streamed on online streaming websites and TBS on Friday nights.

In January 2016, Activision Blizzard, publishers of the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot; series, acquired Major League Gaming. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the purchase, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick explained that the company was aspiring to create a U.S. cable network devoted to esports, which he described as &quot;the ESPN of video games&quot;. He felt that higher quality productions, more in line with those of traditional sports telecasts, could help to broaden the appeal of esports to advertisers. Activision Blizzard had hired former ESPN and NFL Network executive Steve Bornstein to be CEO of the company&#x27;s esports division.

TV 2, the largest private television broadcaster in Norway, broadcasts esports across the country. TV 2 partnered with local Norwegian organization House of Nerds to bring a full season of esports competition with an initial lineup of &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, and &quot;StarCraft II&quot;.

In April 2016, Big Ten Network announced a collaboration with Riot to hold an invitational &quot;League of Legends&quot; competition between two universities from the collegiate Big Ten Conference, as part of Riot&#x27;s collegiate championships at PAX East. On 17 January 2017, Big Ten Network and Riot announced that it would hold a larger season of conference competition involving 10 Big Ten schools.

Nielsen Holdings, a global information company known for tracking viewership for television and other media, announced in August 2017 that it would launch Nielsen esports, a division devoted to providing similar viewership and other consumer research data around esports, forming an advisory board with members from ESL, Activision Blizzard, Twitch, YouTube, ESPN, and FIFA to help determine how to track and monitor audience sizes for esports events.

In July 2018, on the first day of the inaugural 2018 Overwatch League season playoffs, Blizzard and Disney announced a multi-year deal that gave Disney and its networks ESPN and ABC broadcast rights to the Overwatch League and Overwatch World Cup, starting with the playoffs and continuing with future events.

<text>The Speak &amp; Math (or Speak &amp; Maths in some countries) was a popular electronic toy created by Texas Instruments in . Speak &amp; Math was one of a three-part talking educational toy series that also included Speak &amp; Spell and Speak &amp; Read. The Speak &amp; Math was sold worldwide. It was advertised as a tool for helping young children to become better at mathematics. The Speak &amp; Math had a distinct gray with blue and orange color scheme.

The unit could utilize either 4 &quot;C&quot; batteries or 6 volt DC power adapter. The display was a 9-character, 14-segment vacuum fluorescent display. The Speak &amp; Math used a TI TMS5110 chip for voice synthesis. The Speak &amp; Math, like the earlier Speak &amp; Spell, also had the ability to expand its memory using expansion modules that plugged into a slot inside the battery compartment. No expansion modules are known to have been produced for the Speak &amp; Math however. Like some models of the Speak &amp; Spell, the Speak &amp; Math had a mono headphone port.

Speak &amp; Math had five distinct learning games: &quot;Solve It&quot;, &quot;Word Problems&quot;, &quot;Greater Than/Less Than&quot;, &quot;Write It&quot;, and &quot;Number Stumper&quot;, all playable at three levels of difficulty. &quot;Solve It&quot; is the classic math problem-solving game where the participant must solve five math problems to the best of their ability. &quot;Number Stumper&quot; is a game of Bulls and Cows, whereby one is told the &quot;number [of digits] right&quot; and the &quot;number in wrong place.&quot; &quot;Write It&quot; involves the participant typing the number they hear. &quot;Greater Than/Less Than&quot; involves identifying whether the number on the left is greater than or less than the number on the right.

<text>Golden Liberty (; , ), sometimes referred to as Golden Freedoms, Nobles&#x27; Democracy or Nobles&#x27; Commonwealth ( or &quot;Złota wolność szlachecka&quot;) was a political system in the Kingdom of Poland and, after the Union of Lublin (1569), in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Under that system, all nobles (&quot;szlachta&quot;), regardless of rank, economic status or their ethnic background were considered to have equal legal status and enjoyed extensive legal rights and privileges. The nobility controlled the legislature (the &quot;Sejm&quot;—the parliament) and the Commonwealth&#x27;s elected king.

==Development==
This political system, unique in Europe, stemmed from the consolidation of power by the &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble class) over other social classes and over the monarchical political system. In time, the &quot;szlachta&quot; accumulated enough privileges (established by the &quot;Nihil novi&quot; Act (1505), King Henry&#x27;s Articles (1573), and various &quot;Pacta conventa&quot;) that no monarch could hope to break the &quot;szlachta&quot;″s grip on power.

The political doctrine of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations was &quot;our state is a republic under the presidency of the King&quot;. Chancellor Jan Zamoyski summed up this doctrine when he said that &quot;Rex regnat sed non gubernat&quot; (&quot;The King reigns and does not govern&quot;). The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a &quot;Senat&quot; and an elected king. The king was obliged to respect citizens&#x27; rights specified in King Henry&#x27;s Articles as well as in &quot;pacta conventa&quot; negotiated at the time of his election.

The monarch&#x27;s power was limited, in favour of the sizable noble class. Each new king had to subscribe to King Henry&#x27;s Articles, which were the basis of Poland&#x27;s political system and included almost unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance. Over time, King Henry&#x27;s Articles were merged with the pacta conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From then on, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was always supervised by a group of senators. The doctrine had ancient republican thought at its roots, which was then reapplied with varying success to an elective monarchy&#x27;s political reality.

The foundation of the Commonwealth&#x27;s political system, the &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; (, a term used from 1573), included the following:
* the election of the king by all nobles wishing to participate, known as &quot;wolna elekcja&quot; (free election)
* Sejm, the Commonwealth parliament, which the king was required to hold every two years
* &quot;pacta conventa&quot; (Latin), &quot;agreed-to agreements&quot; negotiated with the king-elect, including a bill of rights, binding on the king, derived from the earlier King Henry&#x27;s Articles
* &quot;rokosz&quot; (insurrection), the right of &quot;szlachta&quot; to form a legal rebellion against a king who violated their guaranteed freedoms
* &quot;religious freedom&quot; guaranteed by Warsaw Confederation Act 1573
* &quot;liberum veto&quot; (Latin), the right of an individual land envoy to oppose a decision by the majority in a Sejm session; the voicing of such a &quot;free veto&quot; nullified all the legislation that had been passed at that session; during the crisis of the second half of the 17th century, Polish nobles could also use the liberum veto in provincial sejmiks
* &quot;konfederacja&quot; (from the Latin &quot;confederatio&quot;), the right to form an organization to force through a common political aim

The Commonwealth&#x27;s political system is difficult to fit into a simple category, but it can be tentatively described as a mixture of these:
* confederation and federation, with regard to the broad autonomy of its regions. It is, however, difficult to decisively call the Commonwealth either confederation or federation, as it had some qualities of both of them
* oligarchy, as only the male &quot;szlachta&quot;, around 15% of the population, had political rights
* democracy, as all of the &quot;szlachta&quot; were equal in rights and privileges, and the Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). Also, the 10% of Commonwealth population who enjoyed those political rights (the &quot;szlachta&quot;) were a substantially larger percentage than in any other European country, and the nobles extended from powerful princes to knights poorer than many peasants; in comparison, in France, only about 1% of the population had the right to vote in 1831, and in 1832, in the United Kingdom, only about 14% of male adults could vote
* elective monarchy, as the monarch, elected by the &quot;szlachta&quot;, was the head of state
* constitutional monarchy, as the monarch was bound by pacta conventa and other laws, and the &quot;szlachta&quot; could disobey any of the king&#x27;s decrees that they deemed to be illegal

==Assessment==
The &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; was a unique and controversial feature of Poland&#x27;s political system. It was an exception, characterized by a strong aristocracy and a feeble king, in an age when absolutism was developing in the stronger countries of Europe, but the exception was characterized by a striking similarity to certain modern values. At a time that most European countries were headed toward centralization, absolute monarchy and religious and dynastic warfare, the Commonwealth experimented with decentralization, confederation and federation, democracy, religious tolerance and even pacifism. Since the Sejm usually vetoed a monarch&#x27;s plans for war, it was a notable argument for the democratic peace theory. The system was a precursor of the modern concepts of broader democracy and constitutional monarchy as well as federation. The &quot;szlachta&quot; citizens of the Commonwealth praised the right of resistance, the social contract, the liberty of the individual, the principle of government by consent, the value of self-reliance, all widespread concepts found in the modern, liberal democracies. Just like liberal democrats of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Polish noblemen were concerned about the power of the state. The Polish noblemen were strongly opposed to the very concept of the authoritarian state.

Perhaps the closest parallels to Poland&#x27;s &#x27;Noble Democracy&#x27; can be found outside Europe altogether, in America, among the slave-owning aristocracy of Southern United States, where slave-owning democrats and founding fathers of the US, such as Thomas Jefferson or George Washington, had many values in common with the reformist noblemen of the Commonwealth. However, the comparison is very weak, as the so-called Southern aristocracy was not limited to a hereditary caste; the social structure, based simply on the acquisition (or loss) of wealth and property, was fluid; and there was of course no monarchy or nobility in the United States.

Others however criticize the Golden Liberty, pointing out it was limited only to the nobility, excluding peasants or townsfolk and gave no legal system to grant freedom and liberty to the majority of the population, failing them by failing to protect them from the excesses of the nobility, resulting in the slow development of cities and the second serfdom among the peasants. The Commonwealth was called &quot;Noble&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, sometimes—&quot;the Jewish Paradise&quot;, but also &quot;Purgatory for the Townsfolk (Burghers)&quot; and &quot;Hell for the Peasants&quot;. And even among the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;), the Golden Liberty became abused and twisted by the most powerful of them (magnates). However, this &quot;the Jewish Paradise, but also Purgatory for the Townsfolk and Hell for the Peasants&quot; was a statement of social satire, and it should be evaluated whether it reflected the fact of the age. A number of Russian peasants fled from their far more brutal lords to settle in liberal Poland, which might stand out as example of counterevidence to the &quot;Hell for the Peasants&quot; claim.

In its extreme, the Golden Liberty has been criticized as being responsible for &quot;civil wars and invasions, national weakness, irresolution, and poverty of spirit&quot;. Failing to evolve into the &quot;modern&quot; system of an absolutist and national monarchy, the Commonwealth suffered a gradual decline down to the brink of anarchy because of liberum veto and other abuses of the system. With the majority of the &quot;szlachta&quot; believing that they lived in the perfect state, too few questioned the Golden Liberty and the Sarmatism philosophy until it was too late. With the &quot;szlachta&quot; refusing to pay taxes for a larger and modern army and magnates bribed by foreign powers paralyzing the Commonwealth political system, the Commonwealth was unable to keep up with its increasingly militarized and efficient (through bureaucratization) neighbors, becoming a tempting target for foreign aggression. It was eventually partitioned and annexed by stronger absolutist neighboring countries in the late-18th-century partitions of Poland.

==Similar systems==
The Golden Liberty created a state that was unusual for its time, but somewhat similar political systems existed in other contemporary states, like the Republic of Venice. (Both states were styled the &quot;Most Serene Republic&quot;.)

A similar fate was averted by Italy; first due to a secular inability of the kings of France and Spain, and the Papacy, to come to terms on how to divide the country, then through the reaction against Habsburg domination which, as late as 1861, finally aligned most of the country&#x27;s states in support of a national monarchy under King Victor Emmanuel II of the House of Savoy, hitherto king of Sardinia.

Notably, neither the Republic of Venice nor Italy had a &quot;liberum veto&quot; among their institutions.

==Proverb==
The &quot;szlachta&quot;&#x27;s rights and privileges became proverbial:

—literally,

or, preserving the Polish original&#x27;s rhyme scheme:
To this day, in Poland, this means that a free man (a better sense, today, for &quot;szlachcic&quot;) regards no man as his superior.

<doc id="564223" wikidata="Q749338" url="?curid=564223" title="Dulverton">
<text>Dulverton is a town and civil parish in west Somerset, England, near the border with Devon. The town had a population of 1,408 at the 2011 Census. The parish includes the hamlets of Battleton and Ashwick which is located approximately north west of Dulverton.

To the west of the hamlet lies Ashwick House, built in the Edwardian style in 1901. Also nearby is the estate of Northmoor, formerly a seat of Sir Frederick Wills, 1st Baronet of Northmoor, one of the four Wills Baronetcys, and the founders of the Imperial Tobacco Company. In 1929 Sir Frederick&#x27;s son &amp; heir, Sir Gilbert Wills, 2nd Baronet, was raised to the peerage as Baron Dulverton, whose principal seat was at Batsford Park, near Batsford, Gloucestershire.

Dulverton is a popular tourist destination for exploring Exmoor, and is home to the Exmoor National Park Authority headquarters. The town lies on the route of the Exe Valley Way and Land&#x27;s End Trail.

==Etymology==

The name Dulverton was first recorded in 1084 as &quot;dieglaford-tun&quot; meaning &quot;the settlement at the hidden ford&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Dolvertune&quot;, and suggests it was a royal manor before the Norman Conquest.

The parish also once contained the place Tolchet, noted as one of the relatively rare examples of an English place with a name deriving from Common Brittonic. It seems to comprise the words found in modern Welsh as (&quot;hole, cave&quot;) and (&quot;woodland&quot;), the name being paralleled by several Welsh places called &quot;Tyllgoed&quot;, the Cornish place-name &quot;Tolgus&quot;, and the now-lost Breton place-name &quot;Toulgoat&quot;, along with place-names in England including Olchard.

==History==
The town lies below the Iron Age hillforts of Oldberry Castle, Mounsey Castle and Brewer&#x27;s Castle.

The manor was granted to the Turbervilles by William I and in the late 12th century they gave the church and some land to Taunton Priory. The remainder of the manor passed to the Shete family. The parish of Dulverton was part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred.

The Middle Ages saw continued growth and the establishment of fairs and markets, with several small industries based upon the traditions of upland farming and the wool trade. These include related works such as laundries; originally used for the washing of sheep fleeces in the leats feeding the wide and fast-flowing River Barle, the surviving 19th-century industrial laundries continue to provide a service to surrounding businesses. The market house in Fore Street, which is believed to date from 1760, was re-modelled to become Dulverton Town Hall in 1866, with the porch and external double staircase being added in 1930 by Sir Albert Richardson.

The manor of Dulverton was purchased in 1568 by the Sydenham family seated at Combe House, on the opposite side of the River Barle to Dulverton, a junior branch of the ancient &quot;de Sydenham&quot; family which originated at the manor of Sydenham, near Bridgwater in Somerset, of which other branches were seated in Somerset at Combe Sydenham, Orchard Sydenham (later called Orchard Wyndham) and Brympton d&#x27;Evercy, which latter remained the seat of the Sydenham baronets, which title was created in 1641. In 1858 the Sydenhams sold the manor to the Earl of Carnarvon of Pixton Park, Dulverton. George Sydenham Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe (1848–1933) took his title from Combe, Dulverton.

Exmoor House was built as the Dulverton Union Workhouse in 1855. It is now the headquarters of the Exmoor National Park Authority.

Dr Charles Palk Collyns (1793–1864) set up as a surgeon and apothecary in Dulverton in 1814. Dr Collyns moved into Bilboa House in 1820, where he authored The Chase of the Wild Red Deer; his grave stone is located at All Saints&#x27; Church in Dulverton.

Private housing stock generally ranges from medium-size to substantial Georgian to late Victorian family houses, with a small estate of post-war modern houses and bungalows to the east of the town centre.

The town council (parish council) has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the unitary authority on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The town falls within the unitary authority of Somerset, which was established on 1 April 2023 from the merger of Somerset County Council and four district authorities. It was previously in the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019, having been in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and before that in Dulverton Rural District. Somerset Council is responsible for the former district services including building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism as well as county-level services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

As Dulverton falls within the Exmoor National Park some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a &#x27;single purpose&#x27; authority, which aims to &quot;conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks&quot; and &quot;promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public&quot;, including responsibility for local planning and conservation of the natural and historic environment.

Dulverton is the most populous area of the electoral ward called &#x27;Dulverton and District&#x27;. The ward stretches north from &quot;Dulverton&quot; to Winsford. The total population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 2,491.

It is also part of the Tiverton and Minehead county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Geography==

The town lies in the deep, wooded valley of the River Barle, at an ancient route convergence and river crossing. The river and the Barle Valley are both designated as biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The river passes under the Tarr Steps, a prehistoric clapper bridge possibly dating from 1000 BC. The stone slabs weigh up to 5 tons each. According to local legend, they were placed by the devil to win a bet. The bridge is long and has 17 spans. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The other bridges over the Barle include the five span Barle Bridge which is medieval in origin. It has double rings on the downstream side and single rings on the upstream side. It was repaired in 1624, and subsequently widened in 1819 by John Stone. It was further repaired in 1866 and in 1952–1953 after flood damage. The 18th-century Marsh Bridge was altered in 1866 when the central pier was removed and an iron bridge inserted. The parapet was destroyed in 1952 and reconstructed in steel in 1979. Towards Brushford the River Barle is crossed by the New Bridge dating from 1870, which led to Pixton Park, which was the home of John Dyke Acland and his wife Harriet Acland and later the family of Evelyn Waugh and Auberon Waugh.

The other major river in the parish is the River Exe, which is on the parish boundary with Brompton Regis, which is crossed by the medieval Chilly Bridge and Hele Bridge, and the 18th century Weir Bridge.

In between the town centre and the river is a large recreation meadow which recently underwent renovation by locals (including the pupils of Dulverton Middle School) supported by a Barclays Bank New Futures Scheme.

South of the town is Briggins Moor a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest which provides an example of unimproved mire of a type which is restricted to south-west England and Wales and which has been significantly reduced in extent in the recent past. Purple moor-grass (&quot;Molinia caerulea&quot;) and meadow thistle (&quot;Cirsium dissectum&quot;) are abundant. There is a large colony of the marsh fritillary butterfly (&quot;Eurodryas aurinia&quot;).

==Transport==

Two miles from Dulverton is the village of Brushford, where the Dulverton railway station on the Taunton to Barnstaple line used to be. It opened in 1873 and closed to passengers, who transferred to Dulverton by bus, in October 1966. The station buildings are still visible and it is clear where the lines used to run as the railway embankment is still visible and worn in places although the rails have been lifted.

==Religious sites==

The parish Church of All Saints in Bank Square has a tower from the 15th century, which was extensively restored between 1853 and 1855 when the rest of church was rebuilt by Edward Ashworth. It has been designated as Grade II* listed building.

The Congregational Church in Chapel Street was built in the 19th century with adjoining schoolrooms.

==Cultural references==

Two ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Dulverton&quot; after the Dulverton Hunt. The first, , launched in 1941, was a type II Hunt-class destroyer. She served in the Second World War and was scuttled in 1943 after being severely damaged by German air attack. The second and current , launched in 1982, is a Hunt-class minesweeper.

<doc id="564225" wikidata="Q294419" url="?curid=564225" title="Brett Emerton">
<text>Brett Michael Emerton (born 22 February 1979) is an Australian former professional footballer who played for Sydney Olympic, Sydney FC, Feyenoord Rotterdam, Blackburn Rovers and the Australia national team. Able to play as a wide midfielder or defender, Emerton was known for his &quot;speed, ball control and creativity.&quot;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Growing up in Macquarie Fields, Emerton first played for Gunners Soccer Club at Bensley Road as a five-year-old. He was nicknamed &quot;the greyhound&quot;. During the following years he played for the Macarthur Rams.

===Sydney Olympic===
Emerton was a product of the Australian Institute of Sport and started his career with Sydney Olympic in the National Soccer League in August 1996. During his stay at the club he impressed widely with his pace and stamina, as much as his play with the ball. After making 94 appearances and scoring 16 goals. Emerton began to be noticed in Europe.

===Feyenoord===
After captaining the Olyroos at the Sydney Olympics, Emerton joined Feyenoord in August 2000 for a fee of £415,000. He won a UEFA Cup winners medal in May 2002 (although Emerton himself was banned for the final) and being named the 2002 Oceania Footballer of the Year. He made a total of 111 league and cup appearances for Feyenoord, scoring eleven goals.

===Blackburn Rovers===
After being linked with several Premiership teams, Emerton eventually joined Blackburn Rovers in July 2003 for an undisclosed fee, on a four-year contract, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve always dreamed of playing in the Premiership so to finally achieve it is great.&quot; He turned down offers from other clubs so that he could play in his preferred position on the wing. He scored on his debut in a 5–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 2003. Manager Graeme Souness said of him: &quot;Emerton is a top player. If he can keep up that level of trickery I will be quite happy.&quot; In his first Premier League season, Emerton played in 37 league games, scored two goals, and featured in 40 matches in all competitions. However, Blackburn failed to make progress in the UEFA Cup and struggled against relegation.

Blackburn survived that season but again struggled in the 2004–05 season, not winning a game until September 2004. However, the club preserved their Premiership status following a change of manager and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, where they lost to Arsenal. Emerton paid credit to new manager, Mark Hughes, &quot;It is a huge achievement. When Mark came in we were in a bit of disarray but from the day he arrived we worked on our fitness. Everyone is better for that and it has shown in our performances.&quot;

A more successful season in 2005–06 saw Blackburn reach the 5th round of the FA Cup, losing to West Ham United, the semi-finals of the League Cup and qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Following the end of the season, Emerton signed a new four-year deal at Blackburn in August 2006. Mark Hughes described him as &quot;a player who gives me a lot of options. He can carry the ball from one end of the field to the other. That&#x27;s why teams have coveted him this summer.&quot;
Emerton made 47 appearances in the 2006–07 season as Blackburn finished in mid-table but reached the FA Cup semi-final for the second time in three years, losing to Chelsea, and reached the knock-out stages of the UEFA cup, eventually losing out to Bayer Leverkusen for a place in the last 16. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Emerton had made a total of 167 appearances for Blackburn in all competitions, scoring ten goals.

In July 2008, Emerton signed a new four-year contract, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2012.

On 31 January 2009, Emerton&#x27;s 2008–09 season came to a halt versus Middlesbrough when during a tackle, he damaged his knee. It was revealed on 2 February that he had damaged his cruciate ligament, which meant he would miss the remainder of the season, 6 to 9 months being his expected recovery time.
On 12 September 2009, Emerton made his long-awaited return to Premier League football as a second-half substitute in the 3–1 Blackburn victory over fellow Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 4 October 2009, Emerton started his first match in 2009–10 since being injured at Middlesbrough the previous season, playing against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in a heavy 6–2 defeat with Emerton playing 57 minutes before being replaced by substitute Morten Gamst Pedersen. In all competitions during the 2009–10 season, Emerton made a total of 29 appearances, scoring two goals, and providing four assists. 

On 25 July 2010, he replaced Morten Gamst Pedersen in the 60th minute in the 2–1 defeat to Rangers in the Sydney Festival of Football tournament held in Australia, but could not prevent the team from losing. &quot;The biggest cheer of the afternoon came on the hour mark with the introduction of Brett Emerton, the Australian crowd all standing to applaud the introduction of the Sydney-born midfielder. Emerton scored his first goal of the 2010–11 Premier League season in a 2–1 victory over Blackpool at Bloomfield Road on 25 September, in which he scored in the 92nd minute of injury time. On 4 December, he scored his second goal of the season at Ewood Park against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the 43rd minute, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 victory. Emerton scored the opening goal, and his third goal for the 2010–11 season, against local rivals Manchester United. In Rovers&#x27; last Premier League match of the season against Wolves at Molineux, Emerton scored a volley on 38 minutes and also played the full 90 minutes in a 3–2 win. He was made captain for his final match for Blackburn against Everton at Ewood Park on 27 August 2011, playing the full 90 minutes.

===Sydney FC===
On 25 August 2011, it was announced that Emerton had signed with two time A-League champions, Sydney FC on a three-year deal after terminating his contract with Blackburn Rovers by mutual consent returning him to his homeland after 11 years abroad.
He was the Vice-Captain of Sydney FC. He made his début at Etihad Stadium against A-League giants Melbourne Victory, where he had a 33rd-minute penalty saved by Ante Covic and came off in the 84th minute in front of 40,000 people in attendance in the 0–0 draw. He scored his first goal in the round 7 game against the Central Coast Mariners from a free kick, but Sydney slumped to a 3–2 defeat.

On 23 March 2013, Emerton was shown a red card against Western Sydney Wanderers for a studs-up challenge on left-back and former teammate Shannon Cole. He received a straight red card even though he received a yellow card three minutes before.

On 20 July 2013, Emerton captained the A-League All Stars in the inaugural A-League All Stars Game against Manchester United, a match in which the A-League All Stars were thrashed 5–1, courtesy of goals from Danny Welbeck, Jesse Lingard and Robin van Persie. Emerton was substituted off in the 83rd minute of the match, and was replaced by Adelaide United midfielder Marcelo Carrusca.

On 16 January 2014, Emerton announced his retirement from professional football as a result of his persistent back problems.

==International career==
Emerton was captain of the &quot;Olyroos&quot;, Australia&#x27;s Olympic football team, at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he was sent off against Nigeria as Australia were beaten 3–2 and went out of the tournament. He was named in the Australia squad for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup held in South Korea and Japan and made the starting line-up in a shock win over France and a defeat by South Korea as Australia qualified from the Group stages.

Emerton was a member of the Australian national team that lost out on the final place in the 2002 World Cup finals in Korea and Japan when Uruguay beat Australia over two legs in November 2001. He played in the team that comprehensively beat England 3–1 at the Boleyn Ground in February 2003, scoring the final goal to seal an impressive win.

Emerton played in both legs of World Cup play-off against Uruguay in November 2005, when the Socceroos qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, the first time that Australia had reached the finals of the World Cup since 1974, and was named in the Australian squad for the World Cup finals. He was in the starting line-up for all three Group Stage games against Japan, Brazil and Croatia as Australia qualified for the second round. However, he received two yellow cards against Croatia, was sent off in the 87th minute and subsequently missed the Socceroos&#x27; second round match against Italy.

Emerton scored two goals against Qatar in Australia&#x27;s fourth match of World Cup Qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in Doha. The match finished 3–1 to the Australians, as the nation advanced to the second round of the World Cup qualifiers. He also scored two goals against Qatar on 15 October in Brisbane, one from the penalty spot and the other a right foot finish from a flowing Australian move. Since returning from injury Emerton has received an international recall for the upcoming matches against the Netherlands and Oman. In his return match for the Socceroos against the Netherlands, Emerton came on as a second-half substitute for Josh Kennedy, and made an exceptional return by looking dangerous on the right side of midfield. He then started the next match on against Oman and played a full 90 minutes. Emerton scored a late winner against Oman in the 2011 Asian Cup Qualifying fixture to give the Socceroos a 2–1 win. On 17 November 2010, he injured his hamstring whilst on international duty against Egypt in a 3–0 defeat in Cairo. On 25 January 2011, Emerton scored his 18th goal for his country and the fourth goal in the 73rd minute of the match when he scored against Uzbekistan in a 6–0 win in the semi-finals of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup after coming on from the bench. He played a total of 5 games at the tournament. On 5 June 2011, he captained Australia in the absence of Lucas Neill in a 3–0 victory over New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval. On 7 June 2011, Emerton started the friendly game against Serbia playing in the 0–0 draw. Emerton started and scored the winner in a 1–0 victory for the Socceroos against Hong Kong in East Asian Cup qualification.

<doc id="564227" wikidata="Q2095663" url="?curid=564227" title="Stille Omgang">
<text>A stille omgang (&quot;Silent Walk&quot; or circumambulation) is an informal ritual that serves as substitute for the Roman Catholic processions that were prohibited after the Reformation in the Netherlands in the 16th century until the abolition of the Dutch constitutional procession ban in 1983. Best known is the &quot;Stille Omgang&quot; of Amsterdam, which is however still performed every year in March.

This walk commemorates the Miracle of the Host of 16 March 1345, a Eucharistic miracle which involved a dying man vomiting upon being given the Holy Sacrament and last rites. The Host was then, due to liturgical regulations, put in the fire, but miraculously remained intact and could be retrieved from the ashes the following day. This miracle was quickly recognized by the municipality of Amsterdam and the bishop of Utrecht, and a large pilgrimage chapel, the &quot;Heilige Stede&quot; (&quot;Holy Site&quot;) was built where the house had stood, and the Heiligeweg (&quot;Holy Way&quot;) as the major pilgrimage route to it.

The &quot;Stille Omgang&quot; fell out of an individual practice since the 17th century, but was revived in a collective form in 1881, imitating in that way the medieval procession for the Miracle. During the 1950s up to 90.000 Catholics, from all over the Netherlands, walked the Silent Walk, in 2016 usually about 5,000 people took part in it, following Mass in one of Amsterdam&#x27;s churches. However since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019 and later, with the restart in 2023 the amount of participants fell back to 2000. The Walk always occurs on the night of Saturday to Sunday following the start of the &quot;Mirakelfeest&quot;, which is on the first Wednesday after 12 March.

Eugenio Brunetta d&#x27;Usseaux (14 December 1857 – 8 January 1919) was an Italian nobleman and member of the International Olympic Committee.

== Early life ==
Eugenio Brunetta d&#x27;Usseaux was born on the 14 December 1857, in Vercelli, and was educated in Turin.{{sfn|De Luna|2005|pp=19-20}} His father, the count Carlo Augusto Brunetta of Usseaux was a high-ranking official of the Royal Sardinian Army, headquartered in the same city.{{sfn|De Luna|2005|p=15}} His mother, Carolyne Mattone of Benevello, also came from an Italian noble family, and was related to the family Valperga since seven centuries before.

At the end of his studies in the exclusive Nobles College located in the modern Academy of Science of Turin, Brunetta married Caterine di Zeyffat, a landowner of enormous plots in Ukraine, whose family had close ties to the Imperial family. The couple lived in Torino and in Paris.{{sfn|Olympedia}}

== Sports ==
After the early death of his wife began devoting himself to sports organizing.{{sfn|Olympedia}} Himself an active rower and rider, the count was very interested in sports, and was in Paris that he met with Baron Pierre de Coubertin interested to him, for the reinstatement of the Olympic Games. His engagement for the sports (ideals) was so very close to him, that in 1897 Brunetta d&#x27;Usseaux become member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he remained until his death, as general secretary since 1908. Till the 21st century, he was the only Italian person recovering this charge.

He succeeded in bringing the 1908 Summer Olympics to Rome, but Italy had to forfeit the organization of the Olympics in 1906, due to financial and organisational problems. The 1908 Games were held in London instead. That same year, Brunetta d&#x27;Usseaux was appointed secretary of the IOC. In this position, he tried to get winter sports on the Olympic programme, and suggested to have a separate winter sports week attached to the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. This was opposed by the Swedish organizers, but Brunetta d&#x27;Usseaux managed to get a winter sports week scheduled for 1916. Due to World War I, these Olympics were never organized.

== Death ==
The count died, under unclear circumstances,{{sfn|Bonini|Verratti|2011|p=16}} in France in 1919, and would not live to see the first Winter Olympic Games in 1924, maybe in Nice.{{sfn|De Luna|2005|p=10}} At that time, he would to come in Russia for acknowledging the family of his wife, after the start of Russian Revolution.

He was appointed as Bailiff of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

<doc id="564236" wikidata="Q1229094" url="?curid=564236" title="Appledore, Torridge">
<text>Appledore is a village at the mouth of the River Torridge, about 6 miles (10 km) west of Barnstaple and about 3 miles (5 km) north of Bideford in the county of Devon, England. It is the home of Appledore Shipbuilders, a lifeboat slipway and Hocking&#x27;s Ice Cream, a brand of ice cream only sold in North Devon. There are numerous shops, cafes and galleries. The local football club is Appledore F.C. The ward population at the 2011 census increased to 2,814.

== History ==
Appledore is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 (though it mentions two other, smaller, Appledores in Devon). Its earliest recorded name, in 1335, is &quot;le Apildore in the manor of Northam&quot;.
There was a Saxon settlement, but the Devon historian WG Hoskins says of the local legend that it was the site of a Viking raid in 878 AD, &#x27;there is no authority for this identification&#x27;.
The settlement prospered as a port in the Elizabethan period, and some cottages date from this period. The construction of a quay in 1845 further developed the port, and as a result Appledore has a rich maritime heritage from the second half of the 19th century. The painter Edward Calvert was born there in 1799. Shipowner Sir William Reardon Smith was born in Appledore and went to the Wesleyan school there.

The Richmond Dry Dock was built in 1856 by William Yeo and named after Richmond Bay in Prince Edward Island, where the Yeo family&#x27;s shipping fleet was based. From 1882 until the 1930s it was owned by Robert Cook, and continued in use until the 1960s. It is a Grade II* listed building. There is a maritime museum in the village chronicling the history of shipbuilding and seafaring in the village.

A lifeboat service for the area around the mouth of the River Taw was introduced in February 1825. The boat was kept in the King&#x27;s Watch House at Appledore for six years until a new boat house was built at Watertown, half a mile nearer the sea. From 1848 a second lifeboat was stationed at Braunton Burrows on the opposite side of the estuary but its crew always came from Appledore. A third station was built at Northam Burrows to the west of Appledore in 1851 and the Appledore boat moved there. A new station at Badsteps allowed Northam Burrows to close in 1889 and Braunton Burrows closed in 1918 as it was difficult to find men and horses to launch the boat. Appledore Lifeboat Station was rebuilt in 2001 and is home to an inshore lifeboat; a larger all-weather Tamar class boat is kept moored just off shore.

==Notable people==
David Blow (1931–2004), biophysicist, died in Appledore

== Railway ==
The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway (B,WH&amp;A,R) was most unusual amongst British railways in that although it was built as a standard gauge line (4 ft in) it was not joined to the rest of the railway network, despite the London and South Western Railway having a station at Bideford, East-the-Water, meaning on the other side of the River Torridge from the main town. The line was wholly situated on the peninsula made up of Westward Ho!, Northam and Appledore with extensive sand dunes, at the mouth of the Torridge and Taw estuary. Appledore railway station and the whole line closed in 1917 having been requisitioned by the War Office (Stuckey 1962).

==Sport and leisure==
Appledore has a Non-League football club Appledore F.C. who play at Marshford. They are currently members of the Devon Football League.

Appledore has two pilot Gig clubs in the village, Appledore PGC and Torridge PGC. 
They both compete in Westcountry regattas and the world championships on the Isles of Scilly.

Appledore Men&#x27;s Crews are in the world&#x27;s top 10.

==Transport==
Appledore is served by an hourly Stagecoach Bus service 21A. It serves:
Appledore - Northam - Bideford - Fremington - Barnstaple - Braunton - Ilfracombe. 
In the summer months, the buses double in frequency to 2 buses an hour.

Stagecoach also runs a circular route called 16.
It serves:
Bideford -Westward Ho! - West Appledore-Appledore - Northam (Via Square) and then back to Bideford.
This bus runs 6 times a week on Tuesdays and Thursday (3x each day)
== Gallery ==
==In popular culture==
In his novel &quot;Westward Ho!&quot;, Charles Kingsley describes Appledore as a &quot;little white fishing village&quot;.

Nikolai Tolstoy, Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s stepson, considers that the fictional town of Shelmerston in O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey-Maturin series may have been based on Appledore. O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s wife Mary Wicksteed grew up in Appledore.

In 2008, the Jackson family (including Tito Jackson) stayed for six weeks in Appledore while searching for a house to buy in the area. The project was filmed for a Channel 4 documentary &quot;The Jacksons are Coming&quot;, which was aired on 27 November 2008.

<text>The Land of Oz is a fantasy world introduced in the 1900 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by W. W. Denslow.

Oz consists of four vast quadrants, the Gillikin Country in the north, Quadling Country in the south, Munchkin Country in the east, and Winkie Country in the west. Each province has its own ruler, but the realm itself has always been ruled by a single monarch. According to &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; the ruler has mostly either been named Oz or Ozma. According to &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, the current monarch is Princess Ozma.

Baum did not intend for &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; to have any sequels, but it achieved greater popularity than any of the other fairylands he created, including the land of Merryland in Baum&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Dot and Tot in Merryland&quot;, written a year later. Due to Oz&#x27;s success, including a 1902 musical adaptation, Baum decided to return to it in 1904, with &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;. For the next 15 years, he described and expanded upon the land in the Oz Books, a series which introduced many fictional characters and creatures. Baum intended to end the series with the sixth Oz book &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910), in which Oz is forever sealed off and made invisible to the outside world, but this did not sit well with fans, and he quickly abandoned the idea, writing eight more successful Oz books, and even naming himself the &quot;Royal Historian of Oz.&quot;

In all, Baum wrote fourteen best-selling novels about Oz and its enchanted inhabitants, as well as a spin-off series of six early readers. After his death in 1919, publisher Reilly &amp; Lee continued to produce annual Oz books, passing on the role of Royal Historian to author Ruth Plumly Thompson, illustrator John R. Neill (who had previously collaborated with Baum on his Oz books), and several other writers. The forty books in Reilly &amp; Lee&#x27;s Oz series are called &quot;the Famous Forty&quot; by fans, and are considered the canonical Oz texts.

Baum characterized Oz as a real place, unlike MGM&#x27;s 1939 musical movie adaptation, which presents it as a dream of lead character Dorothy Gale. According to the Oz books, it is a hidden fairyland cut off from the rest of the world by the Deadly Desert.

==Characteristics==
Oz is, in the first book &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, distinguished from Dorothy&#x27;s native Kansas by not being civilized; this explains why Kansas does not have witches and wizards, while Oz does. In the third book, &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, Oz is described as a &quot;fairy country&quot;, new terminology that remained to explain its wonders.

==Geography==

===The Land of Oz===
Oz is roughly rectangular in shape, and divided along the diagonals into four countries: Munchkin Country (but commonly referred to as &#x27;Munchkinland&#x27; in adaptations) in the East, Winkie Country in the West, Gillikin Country in the North, and Quadling Country in the South. In the center of Oz, where the diagonals cross, is the fabled Emerald City, capital of the land of Oz and seat to the monarch of Oz, Princess Ozma.

The regions have a color scheme: blue for Munchkins, yellow for Winkies, red for Quadlings, green for the Emerald City, and (in works after the first) purple for the Gillikins, which region was also not named in the first book. This emphasis on color is in contrast with Kansas; Baum, describing it, used &quot;gray&quot; nine times in four paragraphs. In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, this is merely the favorite color of each quadrant, used for clothing and other man-made objects, and having some influence on their choice of crops, but the basic colors of the world are natural colors. The effect is less consistent in later works. In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, the book states that everything in the land of the Gillikins is purple, including the plants and mud, and a character can see that he is leaving when the grass turns from purple to green, but it also describes pumpkins as orange and corn as green in that land. Baum, indeed, never used the color scheme consistently; in many books, he alluded to the colors to orient the characters and readers to their location, and then did not refer to it again. His most common technique was to depict the man-made articles and flowers as the color of the country, leaving leaves, grass, and fruit their natural colors.

Most of these regions are settled with prosperous and contented people. However, this naturally is lacking in scope for plot. Numerous pockets throughout the Land of Oz are cut off from the main culture, for geographic or cultural reasons. Many have never heard of Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated around the edges of the country, and constitute the main settings for books that are set entirely within Oz. &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot;, for instance, is set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled areas. In &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot;, Ozma speaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.

In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, a yellow brick road leads from the lands of the Munchkins to the Emerald City. Other such roads featured in other works: one from Gillikin Country in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, and a second one from Munchkin Land in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot;.

Oz is completely surrounded on all four sides by a desert which insulates the citizens of the Land of Oz from discovery and invasion. In the first two books, this is merely a natural desert, with only its extent making it dangerous to the traveler, but in &quot;The Road to Oz,&quot; it is said to turn anyone who touches it to sand. Indeed, in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, Mombi tries to escape through it and Glinda chases her over the sands. Still, it is the dividing land between the magic of Oz and the outside world, and the Winged Monkeys can not obey Dorothy&#x27;s command to carry her home because it would take them outside the lands of Oz. In &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, it has become a magical desert called the Deadly Desert with life-destroying sands and noxious fumes, a feature that remained constant through the rest of the series, although no actual destruction is depicted in the Oz books, unlike in the film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. The desert has nonetheless been breached numerous times, both by children from our world (mostly harmless), by the Wizard of Oz himself, and by more sinister characters, such as the Nome King, who attempted to conquer Oz. After such an attempt in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, the book ends with Glinda creating a barrier of invisibility around the Land of Oz, for further protection. This was, indeed, an earnest effort on Baum&#x27;s part to end the series, but the insistence of readers meant the continuation of the series, and therefore the discovery of many ways for people to pass through this barrier as well as over the sands. Despite this continual evasion, the barrier itself remained; nowhere in any Oz book did Baum hint that the inhabitants were even considering removing the magical barrier.

====Gillikin Country====

Gillikin Country is the northern part of the Land of Oz. It is the home of the Gillikins.

====Quadling Country====
Quadling Country is the southern part of the Land of Oz. It is the home of the Quadlings and ruled by Glinda. Michael Patrick Hearn suggests the name Quadling means &quot;a small inhabitant of the fourth country.&quot;

====Munchkin Country====

Munchkin Country is the eastern part of the Land of Oz. It is the home of the Munchkins.

====Winkie Country====

Winkie Country is the western part of the Land of Oz. It is the home of the Winkies.

===West and East===
The first known map of Oz was a glass slide used in Baum&#x27;s &quot;Fairylogue and Radio-Play&quot; traveling show, showing the blue land of the Munchkins in the east and the yellow land of the Winkies in the west. These directions are confirmed by the text of all of Baum&#x27;s Oz books, especially the first, in which the Wicked Witch of the East rules over the Munchkins, and the Wicked Witch of the West rules over the Winkies.

Like traditional western maps, the &quot;Fairylogue and Radio-Play&quot; map showed the west on the left, and the east on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the compass rose adjusted accordingly. It is believed that this is a result of Baum copying the map from the wrong side of the glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.

Another speculation stems from the original conception of Oz, which at first appeared to be situated in an American desert. If Baum thought of the country of the Munchkins as the nearest region to him, it would have been in the east while he lived in Chicago, but when he moved to California, it would have been in the west.

Modern maps of Oz are almost universally drawn with Winkie country on the right (west) and Munchkin Country on the left (east), with an inverted compass rose. Many Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda&#x27;s spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found through the looking glass in which everything was a mirror image, or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1980 book &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one&#x27;s left as one faces north. March Laumer&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mirror of Oz&quot; attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.

===Location===

Oz, like all of Baum&#x27;s fantasy countries, was presented as existing as part of the real world, albeit protected from civilization by natural barriers. Indeed, in the first books, nothing indicated that it was not hidden in the deserts of the United States. It gradually acquired neighboring magical countries, often from works of Baum&#x27;s that had been independent, as Ix from &quot;Queen Zixi of Ix&quot;, and Mo from &quot;The Magical Monarch of Mo&quot;. The first of these is Ev, introduced in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;.

In &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914), Baum included maps in the endpapers which definitively situated Oz on a continent with its neighboring countries. Oz is the largest country on the continent unofficially known by names proposed by Robert R. Pattrick: Nonestica, for the whole of the countries surrounding Oz; and &quot;Ozeria,&quot; for the whole continent. The land also includes the countries of Ev, Ix, and Mo, which has also been known as Phunniland, among others. Nonestica is, according to the map, adjacent to the Nonestic Ocean.
Later maps, such as that drawn by John Drury Clark and John Burton Hatcher, or the map by James E. Haff and Dick Martin, show Oz on a small continent surrounded by an ocean full of islands, and they attempt to reconcile contradictions in the books, such as the east–west orientation of locations. A fair amount of evidence in the books points to this continent as being envisioned as somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean. At the opening of &quot;Ozma of Oz,&quot; Dorothy Gale is sailing to Australia with her Uncle Henry when she is washed overboard (in a chicken coop, with Billina the yellow hen), and lands on the shore of Ev—a rare instance in which an outsider reaches the Oz landmass through non-magical (or &quot;apparently&quot; non-magical) means. Palm trees grow outside the Royal Palace in the Emerald City, and horses are not native to Oz, both points of consistency with a South-Pacific location; illustrations and descriptions of round-shaped and domed Ozite houses suggest a non-Western architecture. Conversely, Oz has technological, architectural, and urban elements typical of Europe and North America around the turn of the twentieth century; but this may involve cultural input from unusual external sources (see History below).

An argument against the South Pacific is that the seasons in Oz are shown as the same seasons in the United States at the same time. In addition, in &quot;The Wishing Horse of Oz&quot;, Pigasus follows the North Star when he flies to Thunder Mountain, which could only be done in the Northern Hemisphere. Ruth Plumly Thompson asserts in her first Oz book, &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot;, that the language of Oz is English, which also suggests European or American influence.

===Inspiration===
Baum&#x27;s creation of the Emerald City may have been inspired by the White City of the World Columbian Exposition, which he visited frequently. Its quick building, in less than a year, may have been an element in the quick construction of the Emerald City in the first book.

Schematically, Oz is much like the United States, with the Emerald City taking the place of Chicago: to the East, mixed forest and farmland; to the West, treeless plains and fields of wheat; to the South, warmth and lush growth, and red earth.

Ruth Plumly Thompson took a different direction with her Oz books, introducing European elements such as the title character of &quot;The Yellow Knight of Oz&quot;, a knight straight out of Arthurian Legend.

Per the Littlefield Thesis the Wonderful Wizard of Oz is an allegory on the Election of 1896. Under this thesis, the diagonal design of the land of Oz in the engravings for the Oz books is meant to symbolize William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s Cross of Gold.

==Inhabitants==
===Gillikins===
The Gillikins are a race of people that live in Gillikin Country. They mostly wear purple and have purple in their landscapes.

===Quadlings===
The Quadlings are a race of people that live in Quadling Country. They mostly wear red and have red in their landscapes.

===Munchkins===

The Munchkins are a race of short people that live in Munchkin Country. They mostly wear blue and have blue in their landscapes.

===Winkies===
The Winkies are a race of people that live in Winkie Country. They mostly wear yellow and have yellow in their landscapes.

===Witches and wizards===

At the time of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the lands in the North, South, East, and West of Oz are each ruled by a Witch. The Witches of the North and South are good, while the Witches of the East and West are wicked. Glinda (the Good Witch of the South) is later revealed to be the most powerful of the four, although later Oz books reveal that the Wicked Witch of the West was so powerful, even Glinda feared her. After Dorothy&#x27;s house crushes the Wicked Witch of the East, thereby liberating the Munchkins from bondage, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy that she (the Witch of the North) is not as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East had been, or she would have freed the Munchkins herself.

During the first scene in Oz in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Good Witch of the North (Locasta or Tattypoo) explains to Dorothy that Oz still has witches and wizards, not being civilized, and goes on to explain that witches and wizards can be both good and evil, unlike the evil witches that Dorothy had been told of. That book contained only the four witches (besides the humbug wizard), but despite Ozma&#x27;s prohibition on magic, many more magicians feature in later works.

Baum tended to capitalize the word &quot;Witch&quot; when referring to the Witches of the North, South, East, or West but did not do so when referring to witches in general. For example, in the aforementioned first scene of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, Locasta (or Tattypoo) thanks Dorothy for killing the &quot;Wicked Witch of the East&quot;, and introduces herself as &quot;the Witch of the North&quot;, with the word &quot;Witch&quot; capitalized in both cases. However, when she goes on to tell Dorothy that &quot;I [the Witch of the North] am a good witch, and the people love me&quot;, the word &quot;witch&quot; is not capitalized.

White is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a &quot;sorceress&quot; in later books), wears a pure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.

Ozma, once on the throne, prohibits the use of magic by anyone other than Glinda the Good, the Wizard of Oz, and herself – as, earlier, the Good Witch of the North had prohibited magic by any other witch in her domains. The illicit use of magic is a frequent feature of villains in later works in the series, appearing in &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot;, &quot;Rinkitink in Oz&quot;, &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot;, and &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot;.

===Animals===
There are different kinds of animals living in Oz. According to Baum, all animals in Oz have the ability to speak because it is a &quot;fairy&quot; kingdom. When asked by his readers why Dorothy&#x27;s dog Toto did not speak, Baum insisted that he had the ability to, but did not choose to speak. Toto finally does so in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;.

Among the many animals in Oz are:

* A-B-Sea Serpent – A sea serpent that is composed of alphabet blocks.
* Chiss – An evil porcupine spirit that can launch his quills.
* Comfortable Camel – A bactrian camel from outside of the Land of Oz who found his way into the country along with the Doubtful Dromedary and they joined Dorothy Gale&#x27;s party to find the Scarecrow. He almost always feels comfortable during his eventful journey.
* Cowardly Lion – The Cowardly Lion is one of Dorothy Gale&#x27;s friends.
* Crab – A crab ended up in an argument with a Zebra to determine if the world had more water, or more land.
* Doubtful Dromedary – A dromedary from outside of the Land of Oz who along with the Comfortable Camel found their way into the country and they joined Dorothy Gale&#x27;s party to find the Scarecrow. He doubts nearly everything that anyone says.
* Dragons – Dragons are the toughest creatures in the Land of Oz and its neighboring countries. The ones in Gillikin Country live underground and are allowed to come out once every 100 years in search of food.
* Field Mice – The Tin Man once saved the Queen of the Field Mice from a wildcat. Her kind later help Dorothy and her friends get out of a deadly poppy field. The mice also reappear in the Marvelous Land of Oz to help the Scarecrow on his quest to reclaim his throne from General Jinjur, by hiding inside his clothes and jumping out to scare Jinjur and her guards.
* Foolish Owl – The Foolish Owl lives in Munchkin Country. She and the Wise Donkey are public advisers.
* Giant Purple Spiders – A race of spiders in Gillikin Country that catch travelers in their webs and make them their servants.
* Glass Cat – A glass sculpture brought to life by the Powder of Life.
* Gump – Gumps are common creatures in the Land of Oz. They are elk-like creatures with wide-spreading antlers, caprine whiskers, and a turned-up nose.
* Hippocampus – A race of half-horse half-fish aquatic creatures that live in Lake Orizon within Munchkin Country. The lake monster Quiberon once ate them into extinction. After Quiberon was turned to stone by the Wizard of Oz, he used his magic to reconstitute the bones of the Hippocampuses, causing their species to live once more.
* Hip-po-gy-raf – A Hip-po-gy-raf lives in Munchkin Country west of Mount Munch. It appears to be a combination of a hippopotamus and a giraffe.
* Hungry Tiger – The Hungry Tiger is the Cowardly Lion&#x27;s best friend.
* Jackdaws – A bunch of Jackdaws live in Quadling Country.
* Kabumpo – The elegant elephant of Pumperdink.
* Kalidahs – The Kalidahs have the head and back legs of a tiger and the arms, torso, and feet of a bear. Their claws are known to rip a lion in half.
* Kangaroo – A mittens-wearing kangaroo lives near the village of Fuddlecumjig.
* Lonesome Duck – The Lonesome Duck is the only duck in the Land of Oz.
* Orks – Orks are unusual flying animals that have the blended characteristics of a common ostrich and a parrot.
* Rak – A terrible beast with a horrible appetite and a bad disposition. It is said to be bigger than 100 men and can eat any living thing.
* Rattlesnake – A rattlesnake serves as a companion of the A-B-Sea Serpent.
* Squirrel King – The King of the Squirrels that live in Winkie Country.
* Stork – A stork once helped Dorothy and her companions rescue Scarecrow.
* Unicorns – A group of unicorns that live at Unicorners within Munchkin Country.
* Winged Monkeys – Monkeys with bird wings. They obey the owner of the Golden Cap that summons them three times.
* Wise Donkey – The Wise Donkey was a former citizen of the Land of Mo who often advised the King of Mo. He now lives in Munchkin Country with the Foolish Owl.
* Zebra – A Zebra ended up in an argument with a Crab to determine if there was either more water in the world or more land.

===Other races===
There is a multitude of other races living in the land of Oz, many of which only appear once. Among the known races are:

* The Bun People of Bunbury – The Bun People are made of baked goods like breads, buns, cakes, and muffins of all varieties.
* The Bunnies of Bunnybury – A race of civilized rabbits.
* The China People – A race of beings that are made of china (porcelain) that live in Quadling Country.

* The Hoppers – A race of one-legged people that live inside a mountain in Quadling Country.
* The Horners – A race of strange one-horned people that live inside a mountain in Quadling Country.
* The Hyups – A subspecies of Munchkins that live on Mount Munch.
* The Loons – A race of living balloon people that live in Loonville.
* The Magical Mimics – A race of evil shape-shifting creatures that are a type of Erb that live on Mount Illuso.
* The Middlings - A race of large mud creatures with dry grass hair that live beneath the surface of Munchkin Country.
* The Rigmaroles – A race of people that make long deliberate speeches which make use of many words.
* The Scares – A race of grotesque beings that reside in Scare City within Quadling Country.
* The Scooters – A race of people that live on the waters of the Gillikin River. They have long boat-like feet and have sails growing from their wrists to their ribs.

* The Utensians – A race of living utensils that live in Utensia in Quadling Country.
* The Yips – A small community of people that resemble the Hyups.

Outside of them are many other strange races who are often found living in the wilderness of Oz. Despite the overlordship of Ozma, many of the communities live autonomously. Oz has great tolerance for eccentricity and oddness.

Many characters in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and others are common. Entire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country is entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into figurines if removed. The China Princess lives in fear of breaking because she would never be as pretty again, even if repaired.

Many other characters are highly individual, even unique members of a species. Many such people from the outer worlds find refuge in Oz, which is highly tolerant of eccentricity.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The history of Oz before &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (often called the prehistory of Oz as it takes place before Baum&#x27;s &quot;histories&quot;) is often the subject of dispute, as Baum himself gave conflicting accounts. In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the title character recounts that he was a ventriloquist and a circus balloonist from Omaha, and during one flight the rope for his parachute vent became tangled, preventing him from descending until the next morning, and he awoke to find that he was floating over a strange land. When he landed, the people thought he was a great wizard because of his ability to fly. He did not disabuse them of this notion, and with his new power over them, he had them build a city with a palace in the center of Oz. He also ordered them to wear green glasses so it would appear to be made entirely of emeralds. However, in the later Oz books the city is depicted as actually being made of emerald or other green materials. The Wizard was a young man when he first arrived in Oz and grew old while he was there. Afraid of the Wicked Witches of the West and the East, who, unlike him, could do real magic, the Wizard hid away in a room of his palace and refused to see visitors. He lived in this way until the arrival of Dorothy in the first book.

In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; the prehistory was changed slightly. Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, reveals that the Wizard usurped the previous king of Oz Pastoria and hid away his daughter Ozma. This was Baum&#x27;s reaction to the popular 1903 Broadway extravaganza Baum adapted from his book, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, in which the Wizard took the role of the main antagonist and the Wicked Witch of the West was left out.

The Wizard, however, had been more popular with his readers than he thought. In &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, he omitted any mention of the Wizard&#x27;s having usurped the throne of Ozma&#x27;s father, but the largest changes occurred in the next book.

In the preface to &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot;, Baum remarks that the Wizard had turned out to be a popular character with the children who had read the first book and so he brought the Wizard back. During it, the Wizard relates yet another account of his history in Oz, telling Ozma that his birth name was Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs, which, being a very long and cumbersome name, and as his other initials spelled out &quot;PINHEAD,&quot; he preferred to leave just as O.Z. The balloon part of his story was unchanged, except for the detail added by Ozma, that the people probably saw his initials on his balloon and took them as a message that he was to be their king. She relates that the country was already named Oz (a word which in their language means &quot;great and good&quot;) and that it was typical for the rulers to have names that are variations of Oz (King Pastoria being a notable exception to this rule).

Ozma elaborates further, saying that there were once four Wicked Witches in Oz, who leagued together to depose the King, but the Wicked Witches of the North and South were defeated by Good Witches before the Wizard arrived in Oz. According to this version, the King at the time was Ozma&#x27;s grandfather. This version of prehistory restores the Wizard&#x27;s reputation, but adds the awkwardness of both Ozma and her father having been born in captivity.

In &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; Baum writes how Oz came to be a fairyland:
:&quot; Oz was not always a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus preventing its people from all contact with the rest of the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it.&quot;
Thenceforward, no one in Oz would ever age, get sick, or die. After becoming a fairyland, Oz harbored many Witches, Magicians, and Sorcerers until the time when Ozma made magic illegal without a permit. In yet another inconsistency, it is implied that Ozma was the fairy left behind by Queen Lurline to rule the country, contradicting the story where she was Pastoria&#x27;s daughter. This is later confirmed in &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot;:

:&quot;&quot;If you are really Princess Ozma of Oz,&quot; the Flathead said, &quot;you are one of that band of fairies who, under Queen Lurline, made all Oz a Fairyland. I have heard that Lurline left one of her own fairies to rule Oz, and gave the fairy the name of Ozma.&quot;&quot;
While this explains why no one dies or ages, and nevertheless there are people of different ages in Oz, it is completely inconsistent with the earlier versions of the prehistory.

Maguire, author of &quot;&quot; addresses this inconsistency by saying that the people of Oz believe that Ozma is reincarnated—that her spirit was left behind by Lurline, but her body is reborn to different mortal queens.

In Jack Snow&#x27;s &quot;The Magical Mimics in Oz&quot;, the prehistory story is retold. This version relates that Ozma was given to the king of Oz as an adoptive daughter, for he was old and had no children.

In the Magic Land stories of Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the prehistory is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000  years ago by a wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, so he decided to find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it from the rest of the world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov&#x27;s version doesn&#x27;t include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000  years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov&#x27;s series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000  years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to a cave and became the Magic Land&#x27;s main source of metal and gems, an analog to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500  years ago in this continuity).

===History through the first six books===
Eventually, Dorothy Gale and her whole house are blown into Oz from Kansas by a tornado. When the house lands, it crushes the Wicked Witch of the East, ruler of the Munchkins. In an attempt to get back to her home, she journeys to the Emerald City. Along the way, she meets the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow, all of whom accompany her. Once there, they become the first people to gain an audience with the Wizard since he went into seclusion, although he disguises himself because Dorothy now has the Wicked Witch of the East&#x27;s magic silver shoes, and he is afraid of her. The Wizard sends Dorothy and her party to destroy the Wicked Witch of the West and in exchange promises to grant her request to be sent home. Surprisingly, Dorothy &quot;destroys&quot; the Witch by throwing a pail of water on her, causing her to melt. Defeated, the Wizard reveals to the group that he is in fact not a real wizard and has no magical powers, but he promises to grant Dorothy&#x27;s wish and take her home himself in his balloon. He leaves the Scarecrow in his place to rule Oz.

Finally, it is discovered that the wizard had given the daughter of the last king of Oz, Princess Ozma, to the old witch Mombi to have her hidden away. Mombi had turned Ozma into a boy named Tip, whom she raised. When all of this is revealed Tip is turned back into Ozma and takes her rightful place as the benevolent ruler of all of Oz. Ozma successfully wards off several attempts by various armies to overthrow her. To prevent any upheaval of her rule over Oz, she outlaws the practice of all magic in Oz except by herself, the returned and reformed wizard, and by Glinda, and she has Glinda make all of Oz invisible to outsiders. Ozma remains the ruler of Oz for the entire series.

==Economy and politics==
Some political analysts have claimed that Oz is a thinly disguised socialist utopia, though some Baum scholars disagree. Advocates of this theory support it using this quotation from &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;:

: There were no poor people in the land of Oz because there was no such thing as money, and all property of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.

This is a revision of the original society: in the first two books, the people of Oz lived in a money-based economy. For instance, the people of the Emerald City use &quot;green pennies&quot; as coinage. Money was not abolished in the course of the series, but excised from the conception of Oz. Indeed, in &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot;, a character from Oz gets into trouble when he goes to Ev because he was unaware of the concept of money. This decision to remove money from Oz may reflect Baum&#x27;s own financial difficulties in the times when he was writing these books.

Since Oz is ruled by a monarch, benevolent though she may be, Oz is closer in nature to an absolute monarchy than a communist or Marxist state. When she was first introduced, Ozma was the monarch specifically of the Emerald City, but in the description of &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, Oz is presented as a federal state, rather like the German Empire, in monarchies rather than republics: having an overall ruler in Ozma, and individual kings and queens of smaller portions.

The society grew steadily more utopian, in that its peace and prosperity were organized, but from the first book, it was a stupendously wealthy country, in contrast to Kansas&#x27;s crop failures, droughts, and mortgages—just as it also is colorful to contrast with Kansas&#x27;s gray. On the other hand, despite the presence of the Emerald City, Oz is an agrarian country, similar to Kansas; the story has been interpreted as a populist parable, and certainly contains many populist themes.

In &quot;The Wonder City of Oz&quot;, Princess Ozma (called &quot;Queen Ozma&quot; in this book) is seen running for election (&quot;ozlection&quot;) to her office as a ruler against Jenny Jump, a half-fairy newcomer from New Jersey. However, this book was not written by Baum, but by John R. Neill, Baum&#x27;s second successor. Further, the concept of the &quot;ozlection&quot; was not in Neill&#x27;s manuscript for the book but was added by an editor at Reilly and Lee, the publisher.

At times the rulers of Oz&#x27;s territories have grander titles than would normally be customary, but this is done mostly for the satisfaction of the incumbents. The ruler of the Winkie Country is the Emperor, the Tin Woodman. The ruler of the Quadling Country is Glinda the Good. The Munchkin Country is ruled by a king, later identified as Cheeriobed, who is revealed to be married to the Good Witch of the North, who, a spell broken, abdicates leadership of the Gillikin Country to Joe King and Queen Hyacinth of Up Town.

The Royal Flag of Oz is based on the map of the Land of Oz; the four colors represent the four countries, and the green star represents the Emerald City.

==Defense==
Oz is mostly a peaceful land and the idea of subversion is largely unknown to its people. Most military positions are only formal. This has caused many problems, such as in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; when the Emerald City (which was only guarded by an elderly doorman and one soldier who was the entire Army of Oz at the time) was easily conquered by the Army of Revolt led by General Jinjur. This army was in turn overwhelmed by another army of girls led by Glinda.

Security of Oz is mostly maintained by magic such as Glinda&#x27;s spell making Oz completely invisible. Oz also has a natural barrier in the form of a desert that surrounds the land: anyone who touches the desert turns to sand. The Nome King has tried to conquer Oz on several occasions. A nominal army once existed, but it had an extremely large officers/privates ratio; other than its commander the Tin Woodman and one private, the portion of it seen in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; was composed entirely of cowardly officers. At the end of the book, it was said that there are three privates all in all, and it is unknown how many—if any—officers were left at home during Ozma&#x27;s travel to Ev. The private seen in the book named Omby Amby, is later promoted to Captain-General.

In the book &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, there are 2 towns called Rigmarole Town and Flutterbudgets that are the defensive settlements of Oz.

In the movie &quot;Return to Oz,&quot; the mechanical man Tik-Tok is the entire Royal Army of Oz.

Attempts by outsiders to conquer the Land of Oz are frequent, particularly in the Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson. But these attempts are always successfully thwarted in the end, usually by Ozma or by forces sympathetic to her.

==Characters==

Recurring characters in the classic Oz series include:

* Dorothy Gale – A heroic little orphan girl from Kansas. In later Oz books, she eventually moves to Oz permanently after visiting the land several times and having several adventures there. Dorothy ultimately becomes best friends with Princess Ozma who proclaims her an official princess of Oz.
* Toto – Dorothy&#x27;s little black dog whom she loves dearly. Toto is a sidekick companion, loyally following his mistress Dorothy on most of her adventures. It is revealed in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; that even though Toto is not a fairy dog, he can still talk in Oz, he just chooses not to.
* Princess Ozma – The long-lost child Queen and rightful ruler of Oz. She is the only child of Oz&#x27;s deceased mortal king, Pastoria who ruled before the Wizard arrived. She is established upon the throne as the true heir shortly after &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; takes place.
*Uncle Henry – Dorothy&#x27;s uncle who is a Kansas farmer and the husband of Aunt Em. He ultimately moves to Oz with Dorothy and Aunt Em when the bank forecloses on his farm.
* Aunt Em – Dorothy&#x27;s aunt, and the wife of uncle Henry. She ultimately moves to Oz with Dorothy and uncle Henry.
* The Good Witch of the North – The elderly ruler of the northern Gillikins. She is known by Locasta Tattypoo and became the ruler of the Gillikin Country after she overthrew Mombi, the Wicked Witch of the North. She was also the first witch Dorothy encountered upon her first arrival in Oz in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.
* The Scarecrow – A living stuffed man of straw who was made in Oz&#x27;s eastern quadrant called Munchkin Country. He is also a good friend of Dorothy. At the end of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; he became the King of Oz and ruled its imperial capital called the Emerald City after the Wizard left. However, he gladly relinquished the title when Ozma was found.
* The Tin Woodman (a.k.a. Nick Chopper) – An enchanted woodsman made entirely out of tin and is a good friend of Dorothy. He was a Munchkin but is the current Emperor of the western Winkies and lives in a tin castle. He became the official ruler of the Winkie Country after the Wicked Witch of the West was destroyed by Dorothy in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.
* The Cowardly Lion – The talking lion who is a good friend of Dorothy. At the end of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, he became the King of the Beasts and overcame his cowardly ways. In later Oz books, he becomes best friends with the Hungry Tiger; together they rule Oz&#x27;s Animal Kingdom and are the royal chariot pullers for Princess Ozma.
* The Wizard (Oscar Diggs) – The former ruler of Oz and the Emerald City before the Scarecrow and Princess Ozma. A skilled circus entertainer and ventriloquist from Omaha, Nebraska, he used his magic tricks to create illusions that made it appear as if he had real powers. Once a humbug, he is now a real wizard after being trained by both Ozma and Glinda, who successfully taught him how to perform honest magic.
* Glinda – The beautiful and wise Good Witch of the South who rules the southern Quadlings in a ruby palace. She became the benevolent sorceress of the Quadling Country after she vanquished the Wicked Witch of the South (although the classic MGM musical movie of 1939 portrays her as the Good Witch of the North).
*Guardian of the Gates – The friendly gatekeeper responsible for adorning the visitors who wish to enter Oz&#x27;s capital with the green-tinted spectacles. He is described as being a very jolly and short man who wears fancy green clothing and has green-tinted skin.
* Soldier with the Green Whiskers – The Captain-General of the Royal Army of Oz who guards the main entrance of the royal palace in the Emerald City. His real name is Omby Amby Wantowin Battles. He is a very tall man who has a very long green beard.

* The Shaggy Man – A homeless but friendly man from &quot;the real world&quot;. He ends up living in Oz permanently.
* Button-Bright – A lost little boy of only four- or five-years-old. He is from a wealthy family in Philadelphia but has many adventures in Oz and its neighboring kingdoms.
* Eureka – Dorothy&#x27;s pink and purple kitten.
* The Patchwork Girl (a.k.a. &quot;Scraps&quot;) – A life-size living doll made entirely of a colorful patchwork quilt. She was brought to life with the magic &quot;Powder of Life&quot; potion by a young Munchkin boy named Ojo. Scraps also becomes the love interest of the Scarecrow.
* Ojo – A young boy of Munchkin descent.
* Betsy Bobbin – A girl a year older than Dorothy from Oklahoma who comes to Oz with a talking mule named Hank after being shipwrecked.
* Polychrome – A colorful and ethereal sky fairy and the youngest daughter of the Rainbow.

* Jenny Jump – A 15-year-old girl from New Jersey who became a half-fairy.
* Pastoria – The former mortal King of Oz who ruled long before the Wizard came and is the deceased father of Princess Ozma.
* Mombi – The former Wicked Witch of the North. Mombi once ruled the northern quadrant of Oz until the Good Witch Locasta Tattypoo overthrew her. She also was partially responsible for the mysterious disappearance of Princess Ozma.
* The Nome King – The main villain and antagonist in the Oz books. He is Oz&#x27;s most threatening enemy who resides in the neighboring Nome Kingdom separated from Oz by the Deadly Desert. The Nome King is always trying to conquer Oz or thinking of ways to overthrow it throughout most of the entire series.

A shorthand reference for a person living in Oz is &quot;Ozite&quot;. The term appears in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot;, &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, and &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;. Elsewhere in the books, &quot;Ozmie&quot; is also used. In the animated 1974 semi-sequel to the MGM film, &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot;, &quot;Ozonian&quot; is in the script. The term &quot;Ozian&quot; appears in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s stage adaptation of the MGM movie and in the work &quot;Wicked&quot;. &quot;Ozmite&quot; was used in Reilly &amp; Lee marketing in the 1920s, a fact which has suggested to some critics that &quot;Ozmie&quot; may have been a typographical error.

==Other media==

===The 1939 MGM film&#x27;s Oz===

The Land of Oz as portrayed in the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite different from that portrayed in Baum&#x27;s books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy&#x27;s falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one&#x27;s home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.

There are many other small differences between the books and the movie. For example, when Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland the Munchkins are seen wearing colorful costumes, but in the book, Munchkins are said to only wear blue as blue is the official dominant color of the east. The first witch Dorothy meets in Oz in the book is the Good Witch of the North, a minor character that only had one other appearance in Baum&#x27;s books but is an important figure of Oz nonetheless. In the movie, this character is conflated with that of Glinda, who is the Good Witch of the South and does not make an appearance until the very end of Baum&#x27;s story. The character of Glinda in the books dresses in all white silk, as white is the traditional color for good witches, whereas in the film she is seen in pink.

It is also worthy of note that the Dorothy of the books is only a little girl who is no more than twelve years old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with ultimate despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old Judy Garland) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do. This is more consistent with Thompson&#x27;s portrayal of Dorothy—Baum is known for his strong and independent female characters.

The nature of the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not actually all green, but everyone is forced to wear green-tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie there is only a gate opening.

===Gregory Maguire&#x27;s revisionist Oz===
In his revisionist Oz novels &quot;&quot;, &quot;Son of a Witch&quot;, &quot;A Lion Among Men&quot; and &quot;Out of Oz&quot;, Gregory Maguire portrays a very different version of the Land of Oz. Maguire&#x27;s Oz is not Baum&#x27;s utopia, but a land troubled by political unrest and economic hardship. One political issue in Maguire&#x27;s novels is the oppression of the Animals (Maguire distinguishes speaking Animals from non-speaking animals by the use of initial capital letters). There are many religious traditions in Maguire&#x27;s Oz, including Lurlinism (which regards the Fairy Lurline as Oz&#x27;s creator), Unionism, which worships the Unnamed God, and the pleasure faiths which had swept Oz during the time that the witches were at Shiz. An example of the pleasure faiths was tic-tok (where creatures were enchanted to tell secrets or the future and run by clockwork), and sorcery.

Maguire&#x27;s presentation of Oz&#x27;s geography is also tinged with politics. A large political prison, Southstairs, exists in caverns below the Emerald City. Gillikin, home of Shiz University, has more industrial development than other parts of Oz. Munchkinland is Oz&#x27;s breadbasket and at one point declares its independence from the rule of the Emerald City. Quadling Country is largely marshland, inhabited by the artistic and sexually free Quadlings. The Vinkus (Maguire&#x27;s name for Winkie Country) is largely open grassland, populated by semi-nomadic tribes with brown skin.

The musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, based on Maguire&#x27;s first Oz novel, portrays an Oz slightly closer to the version seen in Baum&#x27;s novels and 1939 film. The oppression of the Animals is still a theme, but the geographical and religious divisions portrayed in Maguire&#x27;s novel are barely present.

In both the book and musical, several characters from the traditional Oz stories are present with different names. Glinda was called Galinda but changed her name. The Wicked Witch of the West is called Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the East is called Nessarose. In the musical, but not in the book, Boq becomes the Tin Man, and Fiyero becomes the Scarecrow.

===Alexander Melentyevich Volkov&#x27;s Magic Land===
Alexander Melentyevich Volkov was a Russian author best known for his translation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; into Russian, and for writing his own original sequels, which were based only loosely on Baum&#x27;s. Volkov&#x27;s books have been translated into many other languages, and are better known than Baum&#x27;s in some countries. The books, while still aimed at children, feature many mature political and ethical elements. They have been retranslated into English by Peter L. Blystone and partially by March Laumer, who used elements of them in his own books.

===Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Oz===
Philip José Farmer portrays a very different Oz in his book &quot;A Barnstormer in Oz&quot;. The premise is that nothing after the first book occurred—Dorothy never returned to Oz, and instead grew up, got married, and had a son. Her son, Hank Stover, is the main character, a World War I veteran flier and the titular barnstormer. While flying in his Curtiss JN-4 biplane he enters a green haze and emerges in the civil war-stricken land of Oz.

Farmer portrays the land of Oz as a science fiction author, attempting to explain scientifically many of the &quot;magical&quot; elements of Baum&#x27;s story.

===Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s Oz===
The main characters of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s books &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot; pass through many famous fictional worlds including those of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;; &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, specifically Lilliput; E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith&#x27;s Lensman universe; Asgard, connected to Heinlein&#x27;s own Future History universe by the Rainbow Bridge for one specific reason in one specific location; and Ringworld; as well as some of Heinlein&#x27;s own works, specifically those set in his Future History through which Lazarus Long moves; and of course the Land of Oz itself.

The Oz portrayed in the book is very close to Baum&#x27;s Oz, although Heinlein does make an attempt to explain some things from the standpoint of a science fiction author. He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet, where the direction of rotation relative to the poles is reversed, resulting in the sun seeming to rise in what would normally be the west.

Heinlein also explains that the population remains steady in Oz despite the lack of death because it is impossible for children to be born in Oz. When the population does increase through immigration, Glinda just extends the borders an inch or two in each direction, which makes more than enough space for all additional people.

===L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s Oz===
L. Sprague de Camp, like Heinlein, brings his own characters to Oz in his book &quot;Sir Harold and the Gnome King&quot;, part of the collaborative Harold Shea series. Unlike Heinlein, he does not attempt to explain Oz as science fiction, though he does deviate from the original corpus. He follows Thompson&#x27;s Oz books, thus using her spelling of &quot;Gnome&quot; and her final fate of the character, but he postulates an incident that has removed the Ozites&#x27; immortality, with the result that both Ozma and Dorothy have aged and married by the time his story takes place.

===Tad Williams&#x27; &quot;Otherland&quot; Oz===
In the &quot;Otherland&quot; series, by Tad Williams, a virtual reality version of Oz exists, wherein real-world antagonists play sadistic versions of the roles of the Tin Man, The Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion, in a twisted, martial, and post-apocalyptic version of Oz, populated both by characters from the novels, and a large quantity of male and female humans who go by the names &quot;Henry&quot; and &quot;Em&quot; respectively. The humans, computer-generated characters based on the lost minds of children drawn into the Otherland program, look forward to a messianic prophecy foretelling the coming of &quot;The Dorothy&quot;, where a child would be born among them.

===The Outer Zone (&quot;Tin Man&quot;)===
2007 Sci Fi television miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot; reinvents Oz as the Outer Zone (O.Z.), a parallel universe that was first visited by Dorothy Gale during the latter Victorian Era and is ruled over by her descendants. It is implied, by reference to centuries having elapsed since Dorothy came to the O.Z., that time has progressed at different rates in the O.Z. and &quot;the other side&quot;. The re-imagined Oz is described as a place where &quot;the paint has peeled, and what was once the goodness of Oz has become the horrible bleakness of the O.Z.&quot; The scenic design of the O.Z. features elements of steampunk, particularly the &quot;1930s fascist realist&quot; decor of the evil sorceress&#x27;s palace and the computer-generated Central City, analog of the Emerald City.

===&quot;Emerald City Confidential&quot;===
The 2009 point-and-click adventure video game &quot;Emerald City Confidential&quot; reinvents Oz in a film noir style, with Dorothy Gale as a femme fatale, the Lion as a corrupt lawyer, and some other changes.

===&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;===
The Land of Oz appears in the TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and is the focus of the episodes &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy Being Green&quot;, &quot;Kansas&quot;, &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, &quot;Our Decay&quot;, &quot;Ruby Slippers&quot;, and &quot;Where Bluebirds Fly&quot;. It was also seen briefly in the episodes &quot;Sisters&quot; and &quot;Chosen&quot;.

===&quot;OZ: A Fantasy Role-Playing Setting&quot;===
In 2022, Andrew Kolb released &quot;OZ: A Fantasy Role-Playing Setting&quot;, designed for use with tabletop role-playing games, in particular 5th Edition &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;. In this version of Oz, the kingdom is more akin to a city, closely resembling an art deco style in the vein of the 1920s. The city of Oz is broken up into a variety of districts, many of which can be found in the original novel, but adds certain modernizations including a monorail, a complex judiciary system, and a number of political factions.

==Magic of Oz==
Being a fantasy series Oz is rich in magic. In particular, there are many magic items that play an important role in the series.

===Silver Shoes/Ruby Slippers===
When Dorothy leaves Oz after having several adventures there and befriending many of Oz&#x27;s natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert by means of the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her unexpected arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair&#x27;s owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes, however, slip off of Dorothy&#x27;s feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film, the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks her heels together she closes her eyes and says: &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home&quot;. She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.

The silver shoes and ruby slippers are also used in several other versions including &quot;Wicked&quot; by Gregory Maguire. Here the shoes are constructed as a gift and have a chameleon effect. They are decorated with thousands of glittering glass beads that change colors according to the lighting. They can also appear to be several different colors all at once. The shoes are also lost when Dorothy is teleported back home just like in Baum&#x27;s novel. The Broadway musical based on Maguire&#x27;s book further shows that they were all silver, but were changed to ruby red by a spell put upon them by the Witch of the West Elphaba, enabling her sister the Witch of the East Nessarose, who prior had been confined to a wheelchair, to magically walk.

In 1985&#x27;s &quot;Return to Oz,&quot; the ruby slippers have been recovered from their place in the Deadly Desert by the Nome King.

A little-known adaptation of the original story made for British television in the mid-90s starring Denise van Outen explained that they had belonged to a visitor from over the rainbow who came to Oz before Dorothy and they were obtained by the Witch when the visitor wished herself home and they fell off her feet on the return trip.

===Powder of Life===
The Powder of Life is a magic substance from the book series, which first appears in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;.

It is a magical powder that brings inanimate objects to life. The witch Mombi first obtained it from a &quot;crooked magician.&quot; Later in the series, it is revealed that the substance is made by a Dr. Pipt. In order to make the substance, Dr. Pipt had to stir four large cauldrons for six years. Only a few grains of the powder could be made at a time. It is always described as being carried in a pepper box.

In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, the Powder of Life was used to bring Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and the Gump to life. The first batch of the powder in Mombi&#x27;s possession was activated by the following incantation and the action that had to be associated with:

* Raise the left hand, little finger pointing upward, and say: &quot;Weaugh!&quot;
* Raise the right hand, thumb pointing upward, and say: &quot;Teaugh!&quot;
* Raise both hands, with all the fingers and thumbs spread out, and say: &quot;Peaugh!&quot;

In &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, Dr. Pipt&#x27;s sister Dyna activated the Powder of Life with a simple wish that brought the rug of her late blue bear pet to life.

In &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; it brings the title character to life, also the glass cat and a phonograph.

Mombi&#x27;s shaker also contained three &quot;wishing pills&quot; fabricated by Dr. Nikidik.

The Powder has been used by Volkov in his series. There, it is produced from a certain plant of such viability that the smallest piece can grow into a plant within a day, on any surface except for solid metal. However, if it is sun-dried on such a surface, it turns into the Powder of Life. No incantation is required to make the powder work. The second book of the series is centered around a man who animates an army of wooden soldiers with the Powder and uses them for conquering the Magic Land.

In &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, the magic words to bring the inanimate object to life were &quot;WEAUGH, TEAUGH, PEAUGH&quot;.

===Magic Belt===
The Magic Belt is first introduced in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;. The belt belonged to the Nome King, but Dorothy Gale stole it and defeated him. When she leaves Oz, she gives it to Ozma for safekeeping.

In most Oz books, the Magic Belt grants its wearer the ability to transform anyone into any form, and the ability to transport anyone anywhere, and also makes its wearer impervious to harm. In some books, it also grants limited wishes.

In &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, its power is limited: its magic cannot affect objects which are made of wood.

In the non-canonical &quot;The Oz Kids&quot; animated series, the Magic Belt belonged to Dot.

===Magic Picture===
In Ozma&#x27;s boudoir hangs a picture in a radium frame. This picture usually appears to be of pleasant countryside, but when anyone wishes for the picture to show a particular person or place, the scene will display what is wished for. Sometimes the onlooker is able to hear sounds from the scene within the Magic Picture and sometimes an additional device is necessary to transmit sound.

A similar device is present in Volkov&#x27;s series. There, it is given as a present to the Scarecrow by the Good Witch of the South. It is a box of pink wood with a thick frosted glass screen. The device is password activated and limited in range to the Magic Land (with the exception of deep caverns and certain types of magical interference). The box is shown to be virtually indestructible; it withstood repeated abuse from a villain attempting to use it.

===Great Book of Records===

Glinda&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Great Book of Records&quot; is introduced in Chapter 29 of &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;: &quot; &#x27;It is a record of everything that happens,&#x27; replied the Sorceress. &#x27;As soon as an event takes place, anywhere in the world, it is immediately found printed in my Magic Book. So when I read its pages I am well informed.&#x27; &quot; The Book proves useful in &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; and &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot;; and it recurs in many of the stories of Baum&#x27;s successors and imitators. For instance, in &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, the Book is shown to cover more than simply Oz. It provided information concerning the &quot;Black Hats&quot; attempting to murder the four protagonists which enabled Glinda to devise a set of magical glasses requested by Hilda Burroughs that enable her to spot a Black Hat no matter how disguised. It is one of the prime magic devices of Oz; villains steal it when they can (as in &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; or in &quot;Handy Mandy in Oz&quot;). Since it covers the planet and not merely Oz, the Book&#x27;s entries are compressed and sometimes cryptic, and difficult to decipher (as in &quot;Paradox in Oz&quot; or &quot;Queen Ann in Oz&quot;).

The book is also featured in the fantasy series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. Zelena reads the book ignoring Glinda&#x27;s warning and turns green again because she felt betrayed as it was mentioned in the book that Dorothy would save Oz from a great evil (Zelena thought that evil was her but this was never revealed).

===The Love Magnet===
A rusty-looking horseshoe magnet that causes everyone to love its owner. It is closely associated with the Shaggy Man. In &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, he finds that being loved by everyone can be inconvenient. In &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; he reveals that Ozma has modified its powers so that it only works when it is displayed and affects only the feelings of those who see it. It is an essential plot-element in &quot;The Shaggy Man of Oz&quot;. Ozma keeps it hanging over the gate into the Emerald City so that all who enter will come with love, although this does not always seem to happen.

===Magic Fan===
The Magic Fan is brought to Oz by Dorothy in &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot;. Several subsequent books mention it. It creates a powerful wind, capable of blowing away an invading army.

===Fountain of Oblivion===
A fountain in the Emerald City, erected by the witch Glinda to reform a wicked king of Oz in the past. Anyone who drinks from it forgets everything he knows, including his own name. It appears in Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot;, and also plays an important role in the later contributor stories &quot;The Forbidden Fountain of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Shaggy Man of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Wicked Witch of Oz&quot;, and &quot;Paradox in Oz&quot;.

===Magic Dinner Bell===
Created by the Red Jinn, it summons a slave named Ginger, who appears bearing a tray full of delicious food when the bell is rung. Besides providing food, the bell also provides a means of escape from danger: anyone who holds onto the slave when he disappears after bringing the food is transported with him to the Red Jinn&#x27;s castle. There are actually two magic dinner bells, one in the Emerald City and another which the Red Jinn keeps for himself and uses while traveling. The bell is first introduced in &quot;Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz&quot; and also appears in &quot;The Purple Prince of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Silver Princess in Oz&quot;.

==Miscellaneous==

===Talking animals===
In Oz, animals such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger can talk, and all native animals appear to be capable of speech. &quot;&quot; emphasized the difference between Animals and animals. Animals (capitalized) are sentient beings that can talk. Several theories exist as to how animals gained the gift of speech.

The treatment of non-native animals was inconsistent. In the first book, the dog Toto never speaks, although brought to Oz; in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot;, Dorothy specifies that he cannot speak because he is not a fairy dog. However, in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, the chicken Billina acquires speech merely by being swept to the lands near Oz, and in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot;, the same is true of the kitten Eureka and the cab horse Jim when reaching the land of Mangaboos, a similarly magical land. In &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;, Baum restored the continuity: Toto can speak, and always could, but never bothered to, because it was unnecessary.

An additional inconsistency is introduced with &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;: Hank the Mule cannot speak until reaching the Land of Oz, although he lands on the shore of Ev first, where Billina the chicken gained the ability to speak. This might be because &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; was originally a stage play version of &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;; Dorothy was replaced by Betsy because he had sold the stage rights for Dorothy, and Billina was replaced by Hank because a mule could more convincingly be played by two people in a costume. Hank probably could not talk because Baum already had two speaking comedy characters, the Shaggy Man and Tik-Tok. Thus Hank would fill a better niche as a visual comedy character, in the tradition of British pantomime. The part of Hank was also an analog to the part of Dorothy&#x27;s cow Imogene, Toto&#x27;s replacement on stage in the immensely successful 1903 Broadway version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, a success that Baum sought to duplicate for the rest of his life.

There is one small kingdom in Oz where animals are unable to talk: Corumbia.

===Origin of the name Oz===
A legend of uncertain validity is that when relating bedtime stories (the earliest form of the Oz books) Baum was asked by his niece, Ramona Baxter Bowden, the name of the magical land. He glanced at a nearby filing cabinet, which had three drawers, labeled A–G, H–N, and O–Z. Thus he named the land Oz. This story was first told in 1903, but his wife always insisted that the part about the filing cabinet was not true. In &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot;, the name is translated as &quot;great and good&quot;. Several of Baum&#x27;s fairy stories that take place in the United States were situated on the Ozark Plateau, and the similarity of the name may not be a coincidence.

==Legacy==
In 2018, The Lost Art of Oz project was initiated to locate and catalog the surviving original artwork John R. Neill, W. W. Denslow, Frank Kramer, Richard &quot;Dirk&quot; Gringhuis and Dick Martin created to illustrate the Oz book series.

<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) was involved in the development of railway electrification of Britain. Like the LNER and the SR the LMS took over several schemes that had been developed by its constituent companies and also completed some of its own. All were suburban lines, in London, Liverpool and Manchester, and were usually steam lines converted to electric traction. Each service is listed below, showing dates of opening and the railway responsible for its conversion.

==London District==
Fourth rail, route length in 1927 was 40.2 miles (64.3 km).

* Whitechapel - Upminster, used by District Railway and opened in sections as follows:
** 1905 Whitechapel - East Ham 
** 1908 East Ham - Barking
** 1932 Barking - Upminster
* 1914 Willesden Junction - Earl&#x27;s Court
* 1916 Broad Street - Kew Bridge - Richmond
* Euston / Broad Street - Watford Junction, opened in sections as follows:
** 1917 Willesden Junction - Watford Junction: London and North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR). Jointly operated by the LNWR and the Bakerloo line at its opening
** 1922 Euston and Broad Street connected to the line; branch to Croxley Green (L&amp;NWR)
** 1927 Rickmansworth branch (LMS)

See also Watford DC Line, North London Line and West London Line

630 V DC third rail.

* Liverpool Exchange - Southport - Crossens and Ormskirk. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) 
** 1904, April Liverpool - Southport 
** 1906 Liverpool - Aintree (two routes). The independent Liverpool Overhead Railway (opened 1893-1905 and the world&#x27;s first overhead electric railway) was connected to this line by a spur line. 
** 1913 Aintree - Ormskirk
* 1938 Birkenhead Park - West Kirby and New Brighton: the Wirral Railway/Mersey Railway.

==Manchester District==
* 1908 Lancaster - Morecambe - Heysham. 6.6 kV AC overhead. Midland Railway
* 1913 Bury - Holcombe Brook; 1916 extended to Manchester Victoria. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR). Third rail.
* 11 May 1931 Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway. 1500 V DC overhead. Joint LMS/LNER

<doc id="564249" wikidata="Q208553" url="?curid=564249" title="Volkswagen Touareg">
<text>The Volkswagen Touareg (German pronunciation: ) is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV produced by Volkswagen since 2002. The vehicle is named after the nomadic Tuareg people, inhabitants of the Saharan interior in North Africa. The Touareg was originally developed with the Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 and , the Touareg was developed with the Audi Q8, the Bentley Bentayga and the Lamborghini Urus, which shares their MLB Evo platform and chassis. The first generation (2002–2010) offered five, six, eight, ten, and twelve-cylinder engine choices.

==Development==
The Volkswagen Touareg (internally designated &quot;Typ 7L&quot;) was developed as a joint venture project by Porsche and the Volkswagen Group, involving the Audi and Volkswagen brands. During the initial development phase and the early years of its production, Porsche operated as an independent entity, not affiliated with the Volkswagen Group. In response to these market conditions, Porsche&#x27;s CEO at the time, Wendelin Wiedeking, sought to diversify the company&#x27;s product range. This strategy included the introduction of Porsche&#x27;s first four-door vehicle. A team located in Weissach, Germany led by Klaus-Gerhard Wolpert, developed the Volkswagen Group PL71 platform. It is shared among the Touareg, the Audi Q7, and the Porsche Cayenne. The Touareg and Cayenne both seat five, while the Q7&#x27;s stretched wheelbase accommodates a third row for seven passengers.

The Volkswagen Touareg is built at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant in Bratislava, Slovakia, alongside the Audi Q7. The Cayenne is assembled by Porsche in Leipzig, Germany, at a facility built for Cayenne production.

Due to the demand and the exchange rates of euros against the US dollar, as well as different pricing and environmental policies in the US, the V6 and V8 engine variants make up a majority of Volkswagen&#x27;s American Touareg offering. In the United States, the Touareg is advertised as and competes with other luxury crossover SUVs.

==First generation (7L; 2002)==

The first generation Touareg was introduced in 2002. It comes as standard with a 4XMotion four-wheel drive system. It has an automatic progressively locking center differential (with manual override) and a &quot;low range&quot; setting that can be activated with in-cabin controls. The Touareg featured an optional 4-wheel active air suspension, which can raise the ride height on command, and an optional locking rear differential to increase off-road capability. An uncommon option was a front-locking differential. Its load level ground clearance is at , Off-Road Level is at , and extra clearance of . &quot;The Guardian&quot; said &quot;the Touareg is a colossal, grunting beast which seems as wide as it is long&quot; and noted: &quot;it&#x27;s a serious bit of kit. It was co-developed with Porsche and was first introduced in 2003. It won multiple awards such as the Best Luxury SUV, Best Sport/Utility, Best 4x4, and, Least Green Car of 2004 in America.&quot;

===Engines===
====W12 (2005–2010)====
The 6.0-litre double overhead camshaft (DOHC), 48-valve W12 engine version was initially intended to be a limited-edition model, with just 500 units planned to be produced; around 330 were slated for sale in Saudi Arabia, with the remainder sold in Europe. Some of those W12 Touaregs were sold in China, but the number sold is unknown. No sales were made in the United States. Eventually, the W12 model became an ordinary model without any production restrictions. According to Volkswagen, it can accelerate from 0 to in 5.9 seconds and reach an electronically limited top speed of .

====V10 TDI (2002–2008)====
The V10 TDI was offered in the United States for a limited time in 2004, but emissions regulations forced it off the market temporarily.

The V10 TDI returned to the U.S. market as a 2006 model-year vehicle in five states. Later US models went on sale in 2006, which was compliant with 50 states emission with Ultra-low Sulphur diesel and particulate filter. Stricter California Air Resources Board (CARB) emissions standards resulted in the V10 TDI being reduced to only 43 state emissions in 2008 before being cancelled again in the United States. The V10 engine was replaced by a V6 TDI engine that met the CARB minimum emission requirements for the 2009 model year.

===Facelift (2006-2010)===

The Touareg&#x27;s first facelift was unveiled at the 2006 Paris Motor Show, with its North American debut at the 2007 New York Auto Show as a 2008 model. It now features the shield grille styling shared with other vehicles in the Volkswagen range. The updated Touareg has more than 2300 redesigned parts and includes new technological features:
*ABS Plus, which works in conjunction with the traction control system and shortens the braking distance by up to 25% on loose surfaces;
*Front Scan, an adaptive cruise control system which can slow or even stop the car depending on traffic conditions;
*Side Scan, a blind-spot monitor: it uses radar at the rear of the car to sense another car&#x27;s presence and causes light-emitting diodes (LEDs) built into the wing mirrors to flash. If the driver indicates to move out, the LEDs flash at an accelerated rate to warn the driver until the other vehicle moves out of the Touareg&#x27;s field of vision.

The 2007 Touareg could be equipped with a driving dynamics package, a rollover sensor, a 620-watt Dynaudio sound system, and redesigned comfort seats. All diesel versions now have the diesel particulate filter standard.

In the US and Canada, the facelifted Touareg was marketed as the Touareg 2 for the 2008–2010 model years, reverting to simply Touareg in 2011.

====R50 (2007–2010)====

The Touareg R50 is the third Volkswagen after the Golf and Passat to be given the &#x27;R&#x27; treatment by Volkswagen Individual GmbH. The R50 global launch was at the 2007 Australian International Motor Show.

The &quot;R50&quot; naming comes from the engine displacement: 5.0 L. The R50 was offered with a 5.0-litre V10 diesel engine that produces and of torque, pushing the car from 0 to in 6.7 seconds.

The R50 came standard with 21-inch &quot;Omanyt&quot; wheels, sport-tuned air suspension, decorative &#x27;engine spin&#x27; finish interior trim inlays, and an optional four-zone Climatronic climate control system.

====V6 TDI (2007–2010)====
The 2007 version of the V6 TDI has and of torque. With this engine, the Touareg can reach from a standstill in 8.3 seconds.

====V6 TDI Clean Diesel (2009–2016)====
The V6 TDI Clean Diesel featuring Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system replaced the V10 TDI in US and Canada. The Touareg contains a tank in the rear of the vehicle underneath the spare tyre, which stores the AdBlue solution. It is estimated that this tank will need to be replenished every . The Touareg does not include the NOX storage catalyst found in Jetta Clean Diesel TDI due to its heavy weight.

The Touareg BlueTDI was unveiled at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. The production version of the V6 TDI Clean Diesel was unveiled at the 2008 LA Auto Show.

====Touareg &quot;Lux Limited&quot; (2009)====
The Touareg &quot;Lux Limited&quot; is a version of the V6 TDI Clean Diesel (225PS), V6 FSI, and V8 FSI for the US market. It features 20-inch alloy wheels (&quot;Mountain&quot; type) with size 275 all-season tires and a choice of 4 body colours (Sapphire Blue, Black Magic Pearl, Campanella White, and Galapagos Gray). It also came equipped with a full body colour aerodynamics kit, dual power front seats, full Cricket two-tone leather interior, touch screen navigation with streaming Bluetooth audio, 320-watt 11-speaker audio system, and adaptive high-intensity discharge headlamps.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 NAIAS.

====Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid (2009)====
The Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid is a prototype hybrid vehicle featuring a V6 petrol engine with a &#x27;Twin Vortices Series&#x27; (TVS) supercharger rated at at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 3,000 rpm, an electric motor rated at and of torque and an eight-speed automatic transmission. It has combined ratings of and of torque. The electric motor is powered by a 240-cell, 288 V, 6 Ah nickel metal-hydride battery array. The 4motion four-wheel drive system utilises a lighter Torsen centre differential from the Audi Q7 to save weight. The electric motor has a top speed of . Start-stop system supports regenerative braking, and coasting. Power steering and air conditioning were changed to be powered by battery.

The planned production version included a special E-switch that the driver can activate for pure electric driving, coasting speed.

====Engines====

US models include 3.6 V6, 4.2 V8 FSI, BlueMotion 3.0 V6 TDI. Canada models include 3.6 VR6, BlueMotion 3.0 V6 TDI. BlueMotion 3.0 V6 TDI was sold as V6 TDI Clean Diesel in US and Canada.

====Transmissions====

===Marketing===
In Canada and the US, ads showed the Touareg capable of feats that other Volkswagen cars could not accomplish, such as going right through a snowbank while a New Beetle got stuck.

A 2007 Volkswagen Touareg V10 TDI pulled a Boeing 747 as part of an advertising campaign, which holds the world record for the heaviest load towed by a passenger car.

On Holy Innocents&#x27; Day in 2007, Volkswagen Spain&#x27;s website showed a fake Touareg Cabrio convertible. The site was registered to VW&#x27;s Spanish division.

As the second generation Touareg launch campaign coincided with the premier of &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; movie, Volkswagen launched an interactive stunt simulator that allowed fans to play out their own stunts online. Users could maneuver any of six different VW models through various explosions, while altering vehicle speeds, props, sound effects, and camera angles to make that perfect scene.

==Second generation (7P; 2010)==


The second generation (Typ &quot;7P&quot;) Touareg was revealed on 10 February 2010, in Munich and later at the 2010 Beijing International Auto Show.

The new Touareg features a world-first automotive headlight technology: the &quot;Dynamic Light Assist&quot; glare-free high beam. Unlike an adaptive high-beam system, the Dynamic Light Assist system continually and gradually adjusts not only the high-beam range but also its pattern. The beam pattern changes its direction continually so that vehicles in front are not being illuminated, while the area surrounding them is being constantly illuminated at high beam intensity.

===Features===
*Adaptive cruise control with new Stop &amp; Go function
*Lane departure warning system: Lane Assist
*Blind Spot Monitor: Side Assist
*Front Assist Collision avoidance system for front (with full automatic emergency braking)
*Area View with four cameras
*Adaptive Air Suspension with continuous damping control (CDC) and Adaptive Body Roll Compensation
*Standard 8-speed automatic transmission

===Touareg Hybrid (2010–2018)===
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show and later at the 2010 New York International Auto Show and the 2010 Guangzhou Auto Show.

The Chinese model went on sale in early 2011.

<doc id="564258" wikidata="Q3750893" url="?curid=564258" title="Sherkin Island">
<text>Sherkin Island, historically called Inisherkin (), lies southwest of County Cork in Ireland alongside other islands of Roaringwater Bay. It had a population of 111 people at the time of the 2016 Census, and measures long by wide. The island has one pub, a bed and breakfast, a community centre and a Roman Catholic church.

==Climate==
Sherkin is one of the most southerly points of Ireland after the Fastnet Rock, Cape Clear, and Brow Head. It is said that when the frost covers the lawns of Baltimore just across the bay, the grass remains unfrosted on the island.

==Population==
Sherkin once had a population of around 1,000, which started to decline during the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century. Now the population is reduced and varies between the summer and the winter months, with increases in summer as people return to holiday houses and tourists arrive. The population of Sherkin include artists, writers, craft workers, musicians, photographers, beekeepers, cattle farmers, mussel and oyster farmers, oceanologists, fishermen, sailors, teachers, and doctors.

==Transport==
Sherkin is served year-round by a ferry service operating from the port of Baltimore.

The roads on Sherkin are narrow and maintained by Cork County Council. Most of the cars on the island are old and unsuitable for use on the mainland. Given the size of the island, many residents also walk or cycle. The island also has a bus service which primarily transports people to and from the ferry.

==History==
There are a number of archaeological remains on Sherkin. A franciscan friary, known locally as the Abbey, stands above Abbey strand, where the pier is. The seat of the O&#x27;Driscoll Clan was Dún na Long. These two buildings were heavily damaged in 1537 when citizens of Waterford invaded the island after a dispute over a seized and plundered ship. Sherkin has an automated lighthouse, maintained by locals. It is situated at Barrack Point and dates from 1835. The lighthouse marks the southern entrance to Baltimore Harbour, along with the Baltimore Beacon. On the south-western side of the island there is a functioning Roman Catholic church. The main historic sites include:
* Promontory fort – Celtic Iron Age – 600 BC – 400 AD
* Franciscan friary – Medieval – 1460 AD
* O&#x27;Driscoll Castle – Medieval – post 1200 AD

==Tourism==

The ferry to Sherkin sails from Baltimore on the mainland. The island is a tourist destination and it typically takes between 10 and 15 minutes to get to Sherkin from Baltimore. The journey to the neighbouring Gaeltacht island Cape Clear takes on average approximately 40 minutes. A number of Sherkin&#x27;s residents are active in the fields of art, including crafts, painting and writing. The busiest season starts with school summer holidays when families visit the island.

Visitors can book a sea safari trip around the islands. Once on Sherkin pier, people can visit the Franciscan friary, if it is open. Known locally as &quot;the Abbey&quot;, it has a photo exhibition inside and some displays outside.

Sherkin also has camp facilities. Because the island has no local refuse disposal facilities, campers and picnickers are encouraged to bring minimum packaging and take any litter back to the mainland or recycle cans and bottles on Sherkin Pier. Silver Strand is popular for barbecues.

===Festivals===
The busiest day of the year coincides with the Sherkin Regatta festival, a rowing regatta usually held in late July or early August. On this day the island is visited by sea rowers and their supporters, with children&#x27;s activities, music and food stalls. Music festivals are also occasionally held.

== Development and infrastructure ==
The island has a local development officer, and a community-based organisation called &quot;Sherkin Island Development Society&quot; (SIDS). Sherkin Island is supplied with mains power from the mainland through a submarine power cable. Another submarine cable from Sherkin supplies power to Cape Clear island.

===Research===
Sherkin Island Marine Station is a privately run operation located on the north-west of the island. Founded in 1975, it is mainly involved in gathering baseline marine data, and also produces a number of reports, books and the quarterly &#x27;Sherkin Comment&#x27; journal.

<doc id="564260" wikidata="Q3429356" url="?curid=564260" title="Voice of the Faithful">
<text>Voice of the Faithful (VOTF) is a movement of practicing Catholics, founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2002 in the wake of allegations regarding child abuse by Catholic clergy, perceived mishandling of cases of known or suspected abuse, and pastoral failures of Catholic bishops in response to abusers and abuse survivors alike. According to Notre Dame church scholar R. Scott Appleby, Voice is &quot;not challenging the bishops&#x27; authority but calling them to account for mismanagement&quot;. However, that view has been disputed.

==History==
VOTF began when a small group of parishioners met in the basement of St. John the Evangelist Church in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to pray over allegations that priests in the Archdiocese of Boston had abused local youngsters. Its meetings soon became well attended, as well as attracting media attention. At its first conference in July 2002, VOTF attracted more than 4,000 lay Catholics, victims of clergy sexual abuse, theologians, priests, and religious from around the United States. Less than a year after its founding, VOTF had grown to 30,000 members worldwide, and it continues to be a voice for its thousands of members. William D&#x27;Antonio and Anthony Pogorelc documented the early history of this social movement in &quot;Voices of the Faithful: Loyal Catholics Striving for Change&quot; (2007 Crossroad Publishing) This book presents both the hard statistics about the group’s membership and frank and appreciative analysis of the group’s influence.

Its founders ran into trouble early on with language calling for a &quot;Continental Congress&quot; to counterbalance the hierarchy. Voice of the Faithful members were among the protesters who gathered each Sunday at the height of the crisis in the predominantly Hispanic community that is home to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.

Three years after Voice of the Faithful formed to protest the transfers of abusive priests within the Boston Archdiocese, the movement focused on charting a more relevant strategy as a network of affiliates eager to engage bishops.&quot;When I have asked the leadership to tell me what they mean by their third goal, &#x27;to shape structural change within the church,&#x27; they have been unable to clearly articulate its meaning or implications,&quot; Indianapolis Archbishop Daniel M. Buechlein said.

In March 2014 VOTF expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot; with remarks made by Pope Francis in an interview with the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. In response to a question about &quot;fanaticism and the bad faith of the secularized world that doesn’t respect childhood much&quot;, Francis replied,I wish to say two things. The cases of abuse are terrible because they leave very profound wounds. Benedict XVI was very courageous and opened the way. And, following that way, the Church advanced a lot, perhaps more than anyone. The statistics on the phenomenon of violence against children are shocking, but they also show clearly that the great majority of the abuses come from the family environment and from people who are close. The Catholic Church is perhaps the only public institution that moved with transparency and responsibility. No one else did as much. And yet, the Church is the only one being attacked.

VOTF responded, &quot;That the Church may have been the only institution attacked, as in the recent U.N. report, does not matter...We are disappointed that Pope Francis, with his care for the marginalized, desire for social justice and focus on clericalism and reform of the Curia, does not see that holding bishops accountable for coverups and a full release of all secret files are essential for true reform and healing.

Following his installment in December, Bishop of Bridgeport, Frank Caggiano immediately spoke with VOTF members, He met with them again on March 13, 2014 in a meeting he described as &quot;the beginning of a conversation.&#x27; On March 19, members of VOTF joined with SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests) demonstrated outside the Bridgeport, Connecticut Catholic Center, calling on Caggiano to hire an outside firm to investigate allegations against two priests. Caggiano agreed to meet with the demonstrators; their spokesperson said that &quot;she would prefer to do so after he agrees to the investigation.&quot;

==Programs==

Among VOTF&#x27;s goals are: supporting clergy abuse survivors; supporting priests who are helping to heal survivors and correct institutional flaws in the Church; and working to reform governing structures in the Church so that abuse of authority could not happen again.
* &quot;Voice of Compassion fund&quot; takes donations from Catholics who did not want to contribute to the Archbishop&#x27;s Annual Appeal, and offers the funds to Catholic Charities, bypassing the archdiocese.
* Affirming their responsibilities for the good of the Church, VOTF members offer their experiences of faith and their competencies in the Church. The Santa Barbara, California chapter drafted a program to improve implementation of the Los Angeles archdiocese&#x27;s &quot;Safeguard the Children&quot;, the system to ensure that all parishes know what to do in the event of an abuse incident.
* &quot;Measuring and Ranking Diocesan Online Financial Transparency&quot;, ranks 177 dioceses on the availability of their financial statements and other criteria.
* Survivor Support
* Priest Support
* Bishop Selection

==Observations==
With a membership of practicing Catholics, VOTF has always been committed to working within the Church. Early on, the group was endorsed by a number of American Catholic theologians. A 2007 article in &quot;Commonweal&quot; called the group &quot;one of the most interesting and hopeful developments to come out of the Catholic Church’s sexual-abuse crisis.&quot;

David Zizik, founder of the diocesan Parish Leadership Forum, disputes VOTF&#x27;s claim to work in and with existing church structures, citing its refusal to support interim Bishop Richard Lennon’s 2003 Lenten Prayer Initiative and opting instead for a so-called &quot;Silent Watch&quot;, in which VOTF &quot;called for its supporters to protest at the archdiocesan chancery between noon and 3 p.m. each day during Lent&quot;.“We are at loggerheads because many groups within the church have adopted a kind of adversarial [approach].&quot; Such a mindset, says Zizik, is appropriate for a justice system, not a Catholic faith community.
In her 2011 book &quot;Faithful Revolution: How Voice of the Faithful Is Changing the Church&quot;, Tricia Colleen Bruce, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Sociology at Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee, looked at the development of Voice of the Faithful and its efforts to advocate for internal change while being accepted as legitimately Catholic. Drawing on three years of field observation and interviews with VOTF founders, leaders, and participants, Bruce&#x27;s book explores the nature of a religious movement operating within the confines of a larger institution, an example of what the author calls an &quot;intrainstitutional social movement.&quot; In the concluding section of her book, she writes, &quot;VOTF gave Catholics a space to express outrage at the scandal along with frustration and hope for the contemporary, post-Vatican II Catholic Church.&quot;

==Demographics==
In 2004, two years after its founding, a study conducted by Catholic University of America found that VOTF members &quot;share a deep and highly involved commitment to their Church,&quot; The study also found that the majority of members were women, that a small minority had some experience of formation for priesthood or religious life, and that one third were retired. Composition of VOTF membership &quot;leans heavily toward the Pre-Vatican II and Vatican II generations&quot;. A large percentage of VOTF members are not members of an affiliate but follow the movement on the internet. Many are active in their local parish community as serving on parish committees, as lectors, or Eucharistic ministers.

<doc id="564264" wikidata="Q1034392" url="?curid=564264" title="Cape Clear Island">
<text>Clear Island or Cape Clear Island (officially known by its Irish name: Cléire, and sometimes also called Oileán Chléire) is an island off the south-west coast of County Cork in Ireland. It is the southernmost inhabited part of Ireland and had a population of 110 people as of the 2022 census.

The island is a Gaeltacht area (Irish-speaking area), in which Irish is spoken on a daily basis. The nearest neighbouring island is Sherkin Island, which is east of Cape Clear Island. 

The island is divided into east and west halves by an isthmus called the Waist, with the North Harbour to the landward side and the South Harbour on the seaward side. Ferries sail regularly from the North Harbour to Schull and Baltimore on the mainland. The South Harbour is a popular berth for yachts and pleasure boats during the summer months.

==History==
Archaeological sites on the island include a prehistoric cup-marked stone (currently in the island&#x27;s museum), a fulacht fiadh at Gort na Lobhar, a neolithic passage tomb at Cill Leire Forabhain, several standing stones around the island, a promontory fort at Dún an Óir, and a signal tower dating from the Napoleonic Wars. The island also has a number of early Christian sites, and is reputed to be the birthplace of Saint Ciarán of Saigir. The ruin of a 12th-century church, which has protected national monument status, is close to the main pier in the North Harbour.

The island had a population of over 1,052 before the 19th century famine, but the current population of Cape Clear is less than one-eighth of that figure. The island&#x27;s primary school was built in 1897, and was visited by President of Ireland Mary McAleese in 1998.

Cape Clear was originally supplied with electricity produced by diesel generators on the island, but around 1995 these were replaced with a submarine power cable from the mainland.

==Culture and language==
The island is officially identified as a Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking) area. According to the 2016 census there were 145 people over the age of 3 living on the island, with 62% claiming to be able to speak Irish and 27% saying they spoke Irish daily outside the education system.

The population of the island increases in the summer months as students visit the local Irish Colleges, Coláiste Phobal Chléire and Coláiste Chiaráin. Students stay in local houses or dorms and improve their spoken Irish as part of the immersion courses within the Gaeltacht.

Every first weekend of September, the island hosts the Cape Clear Island International Storytelling Festival. The festival has been running annually since 1994.

==Wildlife==
Seals, basking sharks and dolphins are often found in the surrounding waters, while sea pinks and honeysuckle are common plants on the land. Cape Clear is home to a lighthouse and a bird observatory. Cape Clear is popular with bird watchers and at certain times of the year is home to many species of migratory birds as its climate is milder than the mainland and thus more attractive. Bird life includes black and common guillemots, cormorants and storm petrels.

The island has just three or so permanent residents, and is connected to the mainland by Ireland&#x27;s only cable car. The cable car system, which was closed for maintenance during 2022, was reopened in mid-2023 following replacement or refurbishment of its towers, tracks and related infrastructure.

Dursey has no shops, pubs or restaurants. At one point there was a post office on the island; this has since closed.

==Geography and fauna==
The townlands on the island are Ballynacallagh, Kilmichael, and Tilickafinna. There are three main peaks, the highest being . The promontories and rocks off Dursey include:

===Bull Rock===
Off the western point of the island are three rocks: Bull Rock, Cow Rock and Calf Rock. Bull Rock Lighthouse, which stands on Bull Rock, was built in 1888 and automated in March 1991. Bull Rock was inhabited until this time.

===Calf Rock===
A staffed lighthouse on Calf Rock was destroyed in a storm in 1881 and its remains can still be seen.

===Cow Rock===
Cow Rock is home to a number of nesting colonies of seabirds. Dolphins, whales and basking sharks are sometimes seen in the sea off the island.

==History==

Prehistoric sites have been surveyed on the island, including examples of bullaun and cup-marked stones in Ballynacallagh, a prehistoric hut site at Killowen, and a radial stone enclosure at Maughanaclea.

More prominent archaeological sites are visible at Ballynacallagh, where there is a ruined monastic church and graveyard, and at the site of a castle on Oileán Beag (&quot;Small Island&quot;). In 1602 this castle site was a garrison of the O&#x27;Sullivan Beare family. It was destroyed (along with Dunboy Castle) during the Nine Years&#x27; War. Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare claimed that all of the occupants of the castle were killed by a force under the command of George Carew in the Dursey massacre. The 300 islanders were killed; Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare gathered his people from across Cork and set off to take shelter with the O&#x27;Rourkes of Leitrim. Of the 1,000 that set off, 35 survived to reach the O&#x27;Rourkes after the convoy was repeatedly attacked. Little evidence of the castle site remains.

On the highest point on the island, at Tilickafinna, is a signal tower dating to the Napoleonic Wars. This narrow rectangular tower had two storeys over a basement, with each storey supported by vaulted stonework. The tower has been in ruin since the mid-19th century.

During World War II a whitewashed sign saying &quot;Éire&quot; was built and painted close to the signal tower to indicate to pilots that they were overflying neutral Ireland. In July 1943 a Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 crashed in fog on Crow Head near Dursey, killing all crew.

==Tourism==

The island is popular with day-trippers and walkers during the summer months. A waymarked section of the Beara Way loops around the island. Dursey Island&#x27;s Beara Way walk marks the beginning of Europe&#x27;s E8 European long distance path, which crosses Europe, ending in Istanbul, Turkey.

Spanning Dursey Sound, the aerial tramway is Ireland&#x27;s only cable car, and one of the few cable cars that cross the sea in Europe. Used by both tourists and the local population, its towers and tracks were replaced in refurbishment works undertaken during 2022 and early 2023.

Dursey Sound is also one of the &quot;signature discovery points&quot; along the Wild Atlantic Way, a coastal touring route that stretches along Ireland&#x27;s Atlantic coastline.

Dursey has no shops, pubs or restaurants, but a few holiday homes are rented on the island.

<text>Fort Jesus (Portuguese: &quot;Forte Jesus de Mombaça&quot;) is a fort located on Mombasa Island. Designed by the Italian architect Giovanni Battista Cairati, it was built between 1593 and 1596 by order of King Felipe II of Spain, who also reigned as King Filipe I of Portugal and the Algarves, to guard the Old Port of Mombasa. Fort Jesus is the only fort maintained by the Portuguese on the Swahili coast and is recognised as a testament to the first successful attempt by a Western power to establish influence over the Indian Ocean trade.

Cairati, inspired by Italian architect Pietro Cataneo, designed the fort, with the master builder being Gaspar Rodrigues. This was Cairato&#x27;s last overseas work. Although the design of Fort Jesus is an example of Renaissance architecture, the masonry techniques, building materials, and labor are believed to have been provided by the local Swahili people. The fort, built in the shape of a man viewed from the air, is roughly square with four bulwarks at its corners and is considered a masterpiece of late Renaissance military fortification.

==Historical significance==

Fort Jesus was captured and recaptured at least nine times between 1631, when the Portuguese lost it to Sultan Yusuf ibn al-Hasan of Mombasa, and 1895, it fell under British rule and was converted into a prison. After the Portuguese recaptured it from the Sultan in 1632, they refurbished it and built more fortifications, subsequently making it harder for the fort to fall. The fort was subject to an epic two-year siege from 1696 to 1698 by the Omani Arabs, led by Saif bin Sultan. The capture of the fort marked the end of Portuguese presence on the coast, although they briefly captured and re-occupied it between 1728 and 1729 with the help of the Swahili city-states. The fort fell under local rule from 1741 to 1837, when it was again captured by the Omanis and used as a barracks, before its occupation by the British in 1895, after the establishment of the East Africa Protectorate (which later became, in 1920, the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya).

==Preservation and legacy==

In 1958, Fort Jesus was declared a national museum. In 2011, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and highlighted as one of the most outstanding and well-preserved examples of 16th-century Portuguese military fortifications. The fort is Mombasa&#x27;s most visited tourist attraction.

==Overview==
Between 1631 and 1875, the fort was won and lost nine times by the nations contesting control of Kenya. The Omanis took the fort in 1698 after a notable siege of almost three years. It was declared a historical monument in 1958. Today it houses a museum.

The fort was designed by a Milanese architect, Giovanni Battista Cairati, who was the Chief Architect for Portuguese possessions in the East. It was the first European-style fort constructed outside of Europe designed to resist cannon fire. Today, it is one of the finest examples of 16th-century Portuguese military architecture, which has been influenced and changed by both the Omani Arabs and the British.
The fort quickly became a vital possession for anyone with the intention of controlling Mombasa Island or the surrounding areas of trade. When the British colonized Kenya, they used it as a prison, until 1958, when they converted it into a historical monument. James Kirkman was then assigned to excavate the monument, which he did (with a large use of external historical documents) from 1958 to 1971.

The architecture of the fort represents the rough outline of a person lying on their back, with their head towards the sea. The height of the walls is 18 meters. The original Portuguese fort had a height of 15 meters, but the Oman Arabs added 3 meters upon capturing the fort.

The fort combines Portuguese, Arab, and British elements (these being the major powers that held it at different times in history). The Portuguese and British presence is preserved in the presence of their respective cannons. The Portuguese cannons had a range of 200 meters and were longer than the British cannons, which had a range of 300 meters. Oman Arabs marked their occupancy with numerous inscriptions from the Koran on the wooden door posts and ceiling beams. The Muslim tradition of five pillars is also portrayed throughout the fort, with a former meeting hall supported by five stone pillars to the ceiling.

Some of the historical structures still standing in the fort include Oman House, which was the house of the sultan who governed the East African coast. Others are an open water cistern by the Portuguese for harvesting rainwater, and a 76-foot deep well sunk by the Arabs (but its water was too salty to be used for anything but washing).

The fort was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2011.

==Current status==
Today, Fort Jesus is a popular destination for foreign and local tourists and serves as a tourist destination, the fort is important as a host for numerous research programs, a Conservation Lab, an Education Department, and an Old Town Conservation Office.

<doc id="564276" wikidata="Q1641420" url="?curid=564276" title="Delimiter">
<text>A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters for specifying the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text, mathematical expressions or other data streams. An example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a &quot;field delimiter&quot; in a sequence of comma-separated values. Another example of a delimiter is the time gap used to separate letters and words in the transmission of Morse code.

In mathematics, delimiters are often used to specify the scope of an operation, and can occur both as isolated symbols (e.g., colon in &quot;formula_1&quot;) and as a pair of opposing-looking symbols (e.g., angled brackets in formula_2).

Delimiters represent one of various means of specifying boundaries in a data stream. Declarative notation, for example, is an alternate method (without the use of delimiters) that uses a length field at the start of a data stream to specify the number of characters that the data stream contains.

== Overview ==
Delimiters may be characterized as field and record delimiters, or as bracket delimiters.

===Field and record delimiters===
Field delimiters separate data fields. Record delimiters separate groups of fields.

For example, the CSV format uses a comma as the delimiter between fields, and an end-of-line indicator as the delimiter between records:

This specifies a simple flat-file database table using the CSV file format.

===Bracket delimiters===
Bracket delimiters, also called block delimiters, region delimiters, or balanced delimiters, mark both the start and end of a region of text.

Common examples of bracket delimiters include:
===Conventions===
Historically, computing platforms have used certain delimiters by convention. The following tables depict a few examples for comparison.

Programming languages
(&quot;See also&quot;, Comparison of programming languages (syntax)).
Field and Record delimiters (&quot;See also&quot;, ASCII, Control character).

==Delimiter collision==
Delimiter collision is a problem that occurs when an author or programmer introduces delimiters into text without actually intending them to be interpreted as boundaries between separate regions. In the case of XML, for example, this can occur whenever an author attempts to specify an angle bracket character. 

In most file types there is both a field delimiter and a record delimiter, both of which are subject to collision. In the case of comma-separated values files, for example, field collision can occur whenever an author attempts to include a comma as part of a field value (e.g., salary = &quot;$30,000&quot;), and record delimiter collision would occur whenever a field contained multiple lines. Both record and field delimiter collision occur frequently in text files.

In some contexts, a malicious user or attacker may seek to exploit this problem intentionally. Consequently, delimiter collision can be the source of security vulnerabilities and exploits. Malicious users can take advantage of delimiter collision in languages such as SQL and HTML to deploy such well-known attacks as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, respectively.

===Solutions===
Because delimiter collision is a very common problem, various methods for avoiding it have been invented. Some authors may attempt to avoid the problem by choosing a delimiter character (or sequence of characters) that is not likely to appear in the data stream itself. This &quot;ad hoc&quot; approach may be suitable, but it necessarily depends on a correct guess of what will appear in the data stream, and offers no security against malicious collisions. Other, more formal conventions are therefore applied as well.

====ASCII delimited text====
The ASCII and Unicode character sets were designed to solve this problem by the provision of non-printing characters that can be used as delimiters. These are the range from ASCII 28 to 31.

The use of ASCII 31 Unit separator as a field separator and ASCII 30 Record separator solves the problem of both field and record delimiters that appear in a text data stream.

====Escape character====
One method for avoiding delimiter collision is to use escape characters. From a language design standpoint, these are adequate, but they have drawbacks:

* text can be rendered unreadable when littered with numerous escape characters, a problem referred to as leaning toothpick syndrome (due to use of \ to escape / in Perl regular expressions, leading to sequences such as &quot;\/\/&quot;);
* text becomes difficult to parse through regular expression
* they require a mechanism to &quot;escape the escapes&quot; when not intended as escape characters; and
* although easy to type, they can be cryptic to someone unfamiliar with the language.
* they do not protect against injection attacks 

====Escape sequence====
Escape sequences are similar to escape characters, except they usually consist of some kind of mnemonic instead of just a single character. One use is in string literals that include a doublequote (&quot;) character. For example in Perl, the code:
print &quot;Nancy said \x22Hello World!\x22 to the crowd.&quot;; ### use \x22
produces the same output as:
print &quot;Nancy said \&quot;Hello World!\&quot; to the crowd.&quot;; ### use escape char
One drawback of escape sequences, when used by people, is the need to memorize the codes that represent individual characters (see also: character entity reference, numeric character reference).

====Dual quoting delimiters====
In contrast to escape sequences and escape characters, dual delimiters provide yet another way to avoid delimiter collision. Some languages, for example, allow the use of either a single quote (&#x27;) or a double quote (&quot;) to specify a string literal. For example, in Perl:
print &#x27;Nancy said &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the crowd.&#x27;;
produces the desired output without requiring escapes. This approach, however, only works when the string does not contain &quot;both&quot; types of quotation marks.

====Padding quoting delimiters====
In contrast to escape sequences and escape characters, padding delimiters provide yet another way to avoid delimiter collision. Visual Basic, for example, uses double quotes as delimiters. This is similar to escaping the delimiter.
print &quot;Nancy said &quot;&quot;Hello World!&quot;&quot; to the crowd.&quot;
produces the desired output without requiring escapes. Like regular escaping it can, however, become confusing when many quotes are used.
The code to print the above source code would look more confusing:
print &quot;print &quot;&quot;Nancy said &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Hello World!&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; to the crowd.&quot;&quot;&quot;
==== Configurable alternative quoting delimiters ====
In contrast to dual delimiters, multiple delimiters are even more flexible for avoiding delimiter collision.

For example, in Perl:

print qq^Nancy doesn&#x27;t want to say &quot;Hello World!&quot; anymore.^;
print qq@Nancy doesn&#x27;t want to say &quot;Hello World!&quot; anymore.@;
print qq(Nancy doesn&#x27;t want to say &quot;Hello World!&quot; anymore.);

all produce the desired output through use of quote operators, which allow any convenient character to act as a delimiter. Although this method is more flexible, few languages support it. Perl and Ruby are two that do.

====Content boundary====
A content boundary is a special type of delimiter that is specifically designed to resist delimiter collision. It works by allowing the author to specify a sequence of characters that is guaranteed to always indicate a boundary between parts in a multi-part message, with no other possible interpretation.

The delimiter is frequently generated from a random sequence of characters that is statistically improbable to occur in the content. This may be followed by an identifying mark such as a UUID, a timestamp, or some other distinguishing mark. Alternatively, the content may be scanned to guarantee that a delimiter does not appear in the text. This may allow the delimiter to be shorter or simpler, and increase the human readability of the document. (&quot;See e.g.&quot;, MIME, Here documents).

====Whitespace or indentation====
Some programming and computer languages allow the use of whitespace delimiters or indentation as a means of specifying boundaries between independent regions in text.

==== Regular expression syntax ====
In specifying a regular expression, alternate delimiters may also be used to simplify the syntax for match and substitution operations in Perl.

For example, a simple match operation may be specified in Perl with the following syntax:
$string1 = &#x27;Nancy said &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the crowd.&#x27;; # specify a target string
print $string1 =~ m/[aeiou]+/; # match one or more vowels
The syntax is flexible enough to specify match operations with alternate delimiters, making it easy to avoid delimiter collision:
$string1 = &#x27;Nancy said &quot;http://Hello/World.htm&quot; is not a valid address.&#x27;; # target string
print $string1 =~ m@http://@; # match using alternate regular expression delimiter
print $string1 =~ m{http://}; # same as previous, but different delimiter
print $string1 =~ m!http://!; # same as previous, but different delimiter.
==== Here document ====
A Here document allows the inclusion of arbitrary content by describing a special end sequence. Many languages support this including PHP, bash scripts, ruby and perl. A here document starts by describing what the end sequence will be and continues until that sequence is seen at the start of a new line.

Here is an example in perl:
print «ENDOFHEREDOC;
It&#x27;s very hard to encode a string with &quot;certain characters&quot;.

Newlines, commas, and other characters can cause delimiter collisions.
ENDOFHEREDOC
This code would print:

By using a special end sequence all manner of characters are allowed in the string.

====ASCII armor====
Although principally used as a mechanism for text encoding of binary data,
ASCII armoring is a programming and systems administration technique that also helps to avoid delimiter collision in some circumstances. This technique is contrasted from the other approaches described above because it is more complicated, and therefore not suitable for small applications and simple data storage formats. The technique employs a special encoding scheme, such as base64, to ensure that delimiter or other significant characters do not appear in transmitted data. The purpose is to prevent multilayered escaping, i.e. for doublequotes.

This technique is used, for example, in Microsoft&#x27;s ASP.NET web development technology, and is closely associated with the &quot;VIEWSTATE&quot; component of that system.

===== Example =====
The following simplified example demonstrates how this technique works in practice.

The first code fragment shows a simple HTML tag in which the VIEWSTATE value contains characters that are incompatible with the delimiters of the HTML tag itself:
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;__VIEWSTATE&quot; value=&quot;BookTitle:Nancy doesn&#x27;t say &quot;Hello World!&quot; anymore.&quot; /&gt;
This first code fragment is not well-formed, and would therefore not work properly in a &quot;real world&quot; deployed system.

To store arbitrary text in an HTML attribute, HTML entities can be used. In this case &quot;&amp;quot;&quot; stands in for the double-quote:
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;__VIEWSTATE&quot; value=&quot;BookTitle:Nancy doesn&#x27;t say &amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot; anymore.&quot; /&gt;
Alternatively, any encoding could be used that doesn&#x27;t include characters that have special meaning in the context, such as base64:
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;__VIEWSTATE&quot; value=&quot;Qm9va1RpdGxlOk5hbmN5IGRvZXNuJ3Qgc2F5ICJIZWxsbyBXb3JsZCEiIGFueW1vcmUu&quot; /&gt;
Or percent-encoding:
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;__VIEWSTATE&quot; value=&quot;BookTitle:Nancy%20doesn%27t%20say%20%22Hello%20World!%22%20anymore.&quot; /&gt;
This prevents delimiter collision and ensures that incompatible characters will not appear inside the HTML code, regardless of what characters appear in the original (decoded) text.

<doc id="564284" wikidata="Q2881919" url="?curid=564284" title="Bank of the West">
<text>Bank of the West was an American financial institution headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States. It had more than 600 branches and offices in the Midwest and Western United States.

It was founded in 1874 in San Jose, California, as the Farmers National Gold Bank of San Jose. Bank of the West was then owned by the French banking group BNP from 1979 to 2023. Canadian banking group Bank of Montreal (BMO) completed the acquisition of Bank of the West in February 2023, with the intention of absorbing it into BMO&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary BMO Harris Bank. Over the ensuing Labor Day weekend, the Bank of the West brand was retired, and all accounts and branches from both subsidiaries were converted and merged into the renamed BMO Bank, N.A. by September 5.

==History==
===Formation===
Bank of the West began as Farmers National Gold Bank of San Jose, California, in 1874. When all bank notes became convertible to gold or silver in 1880, the bank converted from a gold national bank and changed its name to the First National Bank of San Jose, California.

===Acquisition by BNP Paribas===
In 1970, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) established the French Bank of California. Later that decade, First National Bank of San Jose changed its name to Bank of the West. In 1979, BNP bought Bank of the West and merged in the French Bank of California. The bank owned 35 locations and $350 million in assets.

In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas.

===Mergers and expansions===
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Bank of the West bought several other banks and branches. In 1987, Bank of the West bought Bank of Los Gatos. This was followed by the 1990 purchase of Central Banking Systems; the 1991 purchase of 30 branches in northern California from failed Imperial Savings and Loan; the 1992 purchase of Atlantic Financial Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation; the 1993 purchase of 15 branches in northern California from Citibank for $360 million; the 1995 purchase of NorthBay Savings Bank, headquartered in Petaluma, California; and the 1997 purchase of branches from Bank of America and Coast Federal Bank.

In 1995, First Hawaiian Bank established Pacific One Bank to hold 30 branches in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho that it acquired from West One Bank when that bank was acquired by U.S. Bancorp and had to divest certain assets, due to the number of preexisting branches of U.S. Bank in the region. Three years later, in 1998, BNP and First Hawaiian Inc., the parent of First Hawaiian Bank and Pacific One Bank, created a company under the BancWest Bancorp name to hold Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank, with Bank of the West absorbing Pacific One. The creation of BancWest Bancorp caused the now-called BNP Paribas&#x27;s (BNPP) ownership of the holding company to fall to 45%. BNPP also agreed not to increase its ownership of the bank holding company before November 2001.
In 1999, Bank of the West bought Sierra West Bancorp. This transaction temporarily diluted BNP&#x27;s ownership of the holding company to 42%.

In 2001, as part of the regulatory approval process with Wells Fargo Banks&#x27;s acquisition of First Security Corp., Bank of the West acquired 23 First Security branches in New Mexico and seven First Security branches in Nevada to avoid antitrust issues with overlapping Wells Fargo operations. Also in 2001, First Hawaiian Bank bought Union Bank of California&#x27;s branches in Guam and Saipan. First Hawaiian had established its first branch in Guam in 1970 and its first branch in Saipan in 1997. (Union Bank of California had established its branch in Guam in 1974.) In May 2001, the independent directors of BancWest Bancorp established a special committee that then unanimously voted to accept BNP&#x27;s offer to acquire the remaining 
55% of BancWest Bancorp, making the holding company a wholly owned subsidiary of BNP. The year 2001 concluded with the December purchase by Bank of the West of United California Bank from Japan&#x27;s UFJ Bank.

In March 2004, Bank of the West announced the purchase of Community First Bankshares, a bank holding company that operated Community First National Bank, headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, which had 155 offices in 12 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Soon after, Bank of the West agreed to buy USDB Bancorp, the parent of Union Safe Deposit Bank. In December 2005, Bank of the West bought Commercial Federal Corporation of Omaha, Nebraska. This merger added offices in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma to Bank of the West.

In January 2006, Bank of the West opened a representative office in Tokyo, Japan, and in September 2007, it opened a representative office in Taipei, Taiwan. As of June 2016, Bank of the West&#x27;s CEO is Nandita Bakshi.

In 2022, the bank was listed as one of the &quot;Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusio&quot;n by the Disability Equality Index (DEI).

==Acquisition by BMO==
In December 2021, BNP Paribas agreed to sell Bank of the West to the Canadian banking group BMO Financial Group. BMO announced plans to merge Bank of the West with its existing U.S. subsidiary BMO Harris Bank, which would at least double BMO&#x27;s total presence in the United States. BMO&#x27;s acquisition of Bank of the West completed in February 2023. After the close of business on Friday, September 1, 2023, all Bank of the West accounts and branches were converted over the Labor Day weekend into those of BMO by Tuesday, September 5.

<doc id="564289" wikidata="Q700" url="?curid=564289" title="Swedish Chef">
<text>The Swedish Chef is a Muppet character from the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show,&quot; known for his eccentric culinary skills and communicating in mock Swedish gibberish. He was originally performed by Jim Henson and Frank Oz simultaneously, with Henson performing the head and voice and Oz performing the character with real hands. The Swedish Chef is currently performed by Bill Barretta with Peter Linz performing the character&#x27;s hands. He is best known for his ridiculous cooking methods and the phrase &quot;Bork, bork, bork!&quot;.

==Character==
A parody of television chefs, the Swedish Chef wears a &quot;toque blanche&quot;, has a thick brown moustache and has bushy eyebrows that completely obscure his eyes. He was one of the few Muppets to employ an actual puppeteer&#x27;s visible hands, which extended from the ends of his sleeves and facilitated handling food and utensils. Frank Oz originally provided the character&#x27;s hands.

Nearly all Swedish Chef sketches on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; feature him in a kitchen, waving some utensils while singing an introductory song in a mock language – a semi-comprehensible gibberish supposedly mimicking Swedish phonology and prosody. The song&#x27;s lyrics vary slightly from one episode to the next, but always end with &quot;Bork, bork, bork!&quot; as the Chef throws the utensils aside, occasionally knocking items off a shelf or the back wall in the process.

After this introduction, the Chef begins to prepare a recipe while giving a gibberish explanation of what he is doing. His commentary is spiced with the occasional English word to clue in the viewer to what he is attempting. These hints are necessary as he frequently uses unorthodox culinary equipment (firearms, sports equipment, hand tools, etc.) to prepare his dishes. (e.g. &quot;See de moofin? Und here de boom-a-shootin&quot; before tossing an English muffin into the air and blowing a hole through it with a blunderbuss to make a doughnut.) The sketch typically degenerates into a slapstick finale where the equipment or ingredients (often a live animal he is attempting to cook) get the better of him.

The Chef is referred to by name in one episode, in which Danny Kaye plays his uncle. Kaye reels off a very long name but adds, &quot;But we call him Tom&quot; – much to the Chef&#x27;s amusement. In 2010, the Chef was seen wearing a wedding ring, implying that the character is married.

==Inspiration==
Some claim that the Swedish Chef was inspired by a real-life chef. One example is Friedman Paul Erhardt, a German American television chef known as &quot;Chef Tell&quot;. Another example is Lars &quot;Kuprik&quot; Bäckman, a real-life Swedish chef. Bäckman claims that his rather unsuccessful appearance on an early edition of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; caught the attention of Jim Henson, who later bought the rights to the recording and created Bäckman&#x27;s Muppet alter ego. Bäckman&#x27;s Dalecarlian accent would explain the chef&#x27;s strange pronunciation. Muppet writer Jerry Juhl denied Bäckman&#x27;s story and insisted the character had no real-world counterpart: &quot;I wrote, rehearsed, rewrote, brainstormed, and giggled uncontrollably a thousand times with Jim Henson as we dealt with the Swedish Chef, and I never once heard him mention an actual Swedish chef...&quot;

According to Brian Henson, in one of his introductions for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Jim Henson had this tape that he used to play which was &#x27;How to Speak Mock Swedish&#x27;. And he used to drive to work and I used to ride with him a lot. And he would drive to work trying to make a chicken sandwich in mock Swedish or make a turkey casserole in mock Swedish. It was the most ridiculous thing you had ever seen. And people at traffic lights used to stop and sort of look at him a little crazy. But that was the roots of the character that would eventually become the Swedish Chef.&quot; According to Juhl, &quot;Jim spent a couple of weeks listening to Berlitz tapes while commuting to get his babble perfected. Then, much later, I actually WROTE the babble! Heck, I come from good Danish stock, which Jim and I decided made me an expert in Scandenavian linguistics.&quot;

When interviewed on the subject in Swedish magazine &quot;Expressen&quot; in 1985, Jim Henson claimed that &quot;one of my writers came up with the idea that the chef should sound like the Swedish actors in Ingmar Bergman films&quot;.

==Performance==
The Swedish Chef is a variation of a live-hand Muppet. The Chef&#x27;s lead performer, originally Jim Henson, uses his dominant hand to perform the character&#x27;s head and mouth, and provides his mock Swedish dialogue. Both hands of a second puppeteer, originally Frank Oz, serve as those of the Chef, which, in a twist on the formula, are actual human hands instead of puppet gloves, allowing him to better interact with the food he prepares and the tools he uses.

In recent years, the Chef has been sometimes seen wearing a wedding ring, one belonging to Steve Whitmire, who usually performed his hands during the majority of Bill Barretta&#x27;s tenure as the character. Since Whitmire&#x27;s departure from the Muppets, Peter Linz has served as the Chef&#x27;s hands.

==In Sweden and other countries==

The Muppets have not had the same cultural impact in Sweden as in the United States. In Sweden, the Swedish Chef&#x27;s name was translated as , meaning the &quot;Swedish cook&quot;. A 2012 &quot;Slate&quot; article stated that &quot;the fact that his nonsense words are so widely interpreted as Swedish-sounding is bewildering and annoying to Swedes&quot; and argued that Swedes don&#x27;t find the character funny at all; the author Jeremy Stahl quoted his wife who said the character &quot;doesn&#x27;t sound Swedish, doesn&#x27;t act Swedish, and there&#x27;s nothing Swedish about him. He&#x27;s not funny.&quot; The linguist Tomas Riad said &quot;it&#x27;s not funny for us to laugh at. It&#x27;s funny for other people to laugh at.&quot; To many Swedes, the sing-song quality of the character&#x27;s mock language is suggestive of Norwegian, not Swedish. 

In the German-dubbed version of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the Chef is Danish rather than Swedish, and his name is .

==Appearances==
Besides appearances in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the chef also appears in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979), &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981), &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984), &quot;The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years&quot; (1986), &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; (1987), &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; (1991), an attraction found at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; (1992), &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996), &quot;Muppets From Space&quot; (1999), &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; (2002), &quot;Studio DC: Almost Live&quot; (2008), a sketch for the cast of &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; and an episode with &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; star Jason Earles and &quot;Cory in the House&quot; star Jason Dolley, the Muppet viral video &quot;Popcorn&quot; (2010), &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011), &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014), a regular role on &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2015), and also appearing as a guest alongside Miss Piggy on the 5th season of &quot;MasterChef Junior&quot; (2017). A younger version of the Swedish Chef appeared on the Disney Junior series &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; where he was referred to simply as Chef. The Swedish Chef has also appeared in a 2013 &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; commercial with Robert Flores, Henrik Lundqvist, Steve Levy, and Linda Cohn. He appears in &quot;Muppets Now&quot; on the segment &quot;Økėÿ Døkęÿ Køøkïñ&quot; in which he competes against celebrity chefs. In 2020, he appeared in the cooking simulation video game &quot;Overcooked: All You Can Eat&quot; as a playable character. Swedish Chef appears as a playable character in &quot;Disney Heroes: Battle Mode&quot;, a mobile game featuring Disney characters.

<doc id="564293" wikidata="Q499707" url="?curid=564293" title="BNP Paribas">
<text>BNP Paribas (; sometimes referred to as BNPP or BNP) is a French multinational universal bank and financial services holding company headquartered in Paris. It was founded in 2000 from the merger of two of France&#x27;s foremost financial institutions, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Paribas. It also incorporates many other major institutions through successive acquisitions, including Fortis Bank in Belgium, Direkt Anlage Bank in Germany, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in Italy, Banque Générale du Luxembourg in Luxembourg, and Türk Ekonomi Bankası in Turkey. The group has also been present in the United States through its subsidiaries Bank of the West until 2023 and First Hawaiian Bank until 2019. With 190,000 employees, the bank is organized into three major business areas: Commercial, Personal Banking &amp; Services (CPBS); Investment &amp; Protection Services (IPS); and Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking (CIB).

BNP Paribas is listed on Euronext Paris and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. It is the second largest bank in Europe and eighth largest bank in the world by total assets. It became one of the five largest banks in the world following the 2008 financial crisis. It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. In the Forbes Global 2000, BNP Paribas was ranked as the 33rd largest public company in the world. It has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

Although a French banking group, the Belgian government has been a significant shareholder since 2009 (with 5.3% equity ownership as of mid-2023) as a result of the group&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;Fortis Bank Belgium&quot;, heir to the Société Générale de Belgique established in 1822.

== History ==


In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP&#x27;s bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 23 May 2000.

In 2006, BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy&#x27;s sixth-largest bank. On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the 2008 financial crisis and the bank&#x27;s quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.

On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis&#x27; activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group&#x27;s major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday, 12 December In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.

On 11 February, Fortis&#x27; shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become the property of BNP Paribas. However, the acquisition was completed, and BNP Paribas took 75% shareholding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. In April 2024, it was announced BNP Paribas had acquired Fosun International&#x27;s entire 9% stake in Ageas, worth €730 million. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.

In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone&#x27;s largest bank by deposits held. On 21 September, the bank&#x27;s registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg&#x27;s business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.

===BNP Paribas CIB===

BNP Paribas CIB (Corporate and Institutional Banking) is the global investment banking arm of BNP Paribas, the largest banking group in the world. In October 2010, BNP Paribas was ranked by Bloomberg and Forbes as the largest bank and largest company in the world by assets with over US$3.1 trillion.

BNP Paribas CIB&#x27;s main centres are in Paris and London, with large scale operations in New York, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and smaller operations in almost every financial centre in the world. It employs 185,000 people across 56 countries and provides financing, advisory and capital markets services. BNP Paribas CIB is a globally recognised leader in two areas of expertise: trading derivatives on all asset classes, and structured financing. BNP Paribas CIB also has a large corporate advisory network in Europe and Asia. BNP Paribas CIB has 13,000 clients, consisting of companies, financial institutions, governments, investment funds and hedge funds.

BNP Paribas CIB benefits from the Group&#x27;s large asset base (over €2 trillion) and diverse business model, and was resilient through the 2008 financial crisis. Revenues from BNP Paribas CIB nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2009 as robust investor demand boosted revenues from the bank&#x27;s fixed income trading business unit. CIB&#x27;s revenues totaled €3.351 billion (US$4.82 billion) for the quarter, up 81 percent from the second quarter of 2008, and following record revenues of €3.696 billion in the first quarter of 2009.

== Controversies ==

===Antisemitic allegations===
In 2016 BNP reached an undisclosed settlement with a Jewish employee, following a $40M lawsuit. The employee had been made to watch a training video in the form of a parody of the movie &quot;Downfall&quot;, portraying Adolf Hitler as the CEO of Deutsche Bank, one of BNP&#x27;s competitors and the Nazi soldiers around him as Deutsche Bank executives. Also, his colleagues made a number of anti-semitic comments during his time at BNP Paribas.

===Business with sanctioned countries===
On 30 May 2014, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations. BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US$100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.

On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It was also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering. It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion. BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank&#x27;s $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.

The bank&#x27;s failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be &quot;just fine&quot; and that it had &quot;a comprehensive plan&quot; to avoid similar violations in the future. The company&#x27;s stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement. To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions.

On 6 February 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that it had lifted a pair of 2014 enforcement actions it imposed on France&#x27;s BNP Paribas, after the bank overhauled its compliance with U.S. sanctions laws.

===Check processing===
In 2010 the French government&#x27;s Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to &quot;Exchanges Check-Image&quot; electronic transfer.

===€152 million risk management affair===

The German &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; FOCUS, Bloomberg and the French &quot;Les Échos&quot; newspapers published an article regarding a €152 million mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage was allegedly involved. The bank has sold securities for €326,400 to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is €163 million according to the bank. According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; published an article in March 2018 about the case with the title &quot;BNP Paribas failed to book trades in Germany for a week&quot;. It cites internal documents that show it did not book all trades that happened in structured products in Germany from 2 to 9 December 2015. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; estimates that 8,500 trades might have been affected. It also questions if the bank has hedged their positions if the trades have not been booked.

==Sponsorship==

BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. In 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament.

In 2008 it became the sponsor of the BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux, an ATP Challenger Tour tournament. The company&#x27;s sponsorship expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 two-week tournament in California. It also sponsored the BNP Paribas Showdown and BNP Paribas Tennis Classic exhibition tournaments held in New York City and London respectively. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.

In 2018, BNP Paribas created the production company BNP Paribas Pictures, and supports young cinema talents through an investment fund dedicated to the financing and co-production of the first films of new talents in Cinema, the Fonds Nouveaux Talents. In 2019, the group supports the Femis Residence and Mille visages, which aims to democratize the cinema environment and create bridges between the different professions in cinema. The group also participates in the restoration of cinematographic works such as Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Times&quot; in 2003.

=== Football ===
Between 1981 and early May 2020, BNP Paribas was a partner of the Belgian club RSC Anderlecht for 39 years through BNP Paribas Fortis.

<text>The Locomotives of the Midland Railway (which it always referred to as engines), followed its small engine policy. The policy was later adopted by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and contrasted with the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s policy. The small engine policy was partly the consequence of a difference in the background of senior managers. In most railway companies, the elite position was the design, construction and maintenance of locomotives. Bigger engines brought more prestige and allowed longer trains. In the Midland, the marketing department was paramount. They recognised that people wanted more frequent, shorter trains rather than an infrequent service. It concentrated on very light, very fast and frequent trains.

==Overview==
The small engine policy was, perhaps, carried on too long, giving rise to the derisive poem:

&quot;M is for Midland with engines galore&quot;
&quot;Two on each train and asking for more&quot;
Prior to around 1900, the Midland&#x27;s locomotives were not noticeably different in size or power to those of other British railway companies; what was more notable was the company&#x27;s commitment to standardisation of a small number of related locomotive designs. This policy began in the 1850s with Matthew Kirtley as Chief Mechanical Engineer. Kirtley provided two basic engine types - 0-6-0 locomotives for freight and 2-4-0 types for passenger work. Over 800 Kirtley 0-6-0s and 150 2-4-0s were built up to 1873. Samuel W. Johnson and Richard Deeley continued the policy but with a gradual progression in the locomotive designs. By 1914 the entire Midland network was being operated by six basic engine designs: a Class 1 0-6-0 tank engine for light freight and shunting, Class 1 0-4-4T tank engine for light passenger work, Class 2 4-4-0 engine for general passenger work, Class 3 0-6-0 engines in tank and tender variants for mixed traffic and freight, and Class 4 4-4-0 for express passenger work. This degree of standardisation was exceptional amongst the pre-grouping British railway companies. All the Midland designs were built to the same basic design principles and a &#x27;kit&#x27; of parts meaning that many parts such as boilers, cylinders, wheels, cabs and bearings were interchangeable across some or all of the six types.

During the 1890s, a new phase in British locomotive development began with the arrival of &#x27;large engine&#x27; designs to cope with rising average train weights for both passenger and freight traffic and demand for faster journey times. This new generation of engines featured much larger, more efficient boilers and were physically larger, heavier and more powerful than the locomotives commonly built in the preceding 40 years. During the 1900s, many British railways began introducing new locomotive designs, with the 4-6-0 becoming predominant for express passenger work, the 0-8-0 for heavy freight trains and the 2-6-0 for fast freight and mixed traffic. Unusually amongst the large British railways, the Midland chose not to develop its own &#x27;large engines&#x27; - when such designs were proposed by both Johnson and Deeley, they were rejected by the railway&#x27;s management. Instead the Midland chose to continue production of its existing locomotive designs largely unchanged and thus adopted the &#x27;small engine policy&#x27; for the 20th century.

===Origins of the Small Engine Policy===
The Midland was fortunate in that George Stephenson had built its main lines with very shallow gradients, while its main rival the LNWR had to cope with the hilly country north of Lancaster. The Midland favoured building large numbers of relatively small, low-powered engines to standardised designs. Each engine was cheaper to build and run than a larger equivalent and while more locomotives were required, the Midland&#x27;s Derby Works was able to achieve economies of scale. The Midland found that a single small engine was sufficient on the majority of its well-graded lines, and that it was more efficient to add either more trains of a shorter length to handle greater demand or to employ multiple small engines (two or three) when heavier trains were needed. This was deemed preferable to building a small number of large engines for the routes and duties that required them which did not fit into Derby&#x27;s standardised production and risked being underutilised and incurring expensive running costs unnecessarily. 

Indeed, the Midland&#x27;s operations were often based around keeping even its small engines lightly loaded at a time when other railways were not only building larger, more powerful locomotives but working them to their maximum capacity with the heaviest trains possible. The Midland&#x27;s philosophy was to keep individual train weights as low as was practically possible and run more trains, providing short-term economies in fuel consumption and wear-and-tear on the locomotive, which in the long term meant that Midland locomotives generally enjoyed longer service lives than hard-worked contemporaries on other railways. This was one reason why the relatively undersized standard Midland axle bearing was successfully retained for so long into the 20th century - under Midland operating practices the loads imposed on the bearing by a low-powered locomotive working well within its capabilities were minimised.

The overall interlinked light-use design/operate philosophy was formalised in 1907, when under chairman George Ernest Paget and Traffic Inspector John Follows, the Midland introduced a new traffic management system whereby every locomotive type was assigned a single standardised workload (in contrast to the system used by other railways, including the Midland&#x27;s main competitor the London and North Western Railway, whereby new or freshly-overhauled locomotives were given higher workloads, with locomotives progressively being assigned less arduous tasks as their condition deteriorated towards the next overhaul). This required that the standard workload had to be, to an extent, a &#x27;worst case&#x27; scenario of a worn-out locomotive immediately due for overhaul, with the result that train loads were kept low and engines in good condition were not worked to their maximum. This system also ensured the continuation of the Midland&#x27;s practice of continuing to run shorter, lighter but more frequent trains (against the industry trend for longer, heavier but fewer services) since the Midland&#x27;s service timings were calculated based on relatively low power being available.

===Advantages and Disadvantages===
The advantages were in the lower maintenance and fuel costs in ensuring that most engines were not worked to their limit, the permitting of standardised maintenance and inspection intervals (since individual locomotives did not have to be regularly assessed to ascertain their suitability for the work assigned to them) and the simplicity of rostering engines for work, as Midland shed managers could be confident that every engine they had available would be capable of the duty assigned. This allowed the Midland to greatly improve its punctuality and timekeeping - which had been poor in the late 19th century and a source of bad publicity - since the timetables and train loads could be drawn to also assume the standard &#x27;worst case&#x27; locomotive power available, while most of the engines actually in service were in better condition than that. 

One upshot of the new management system was that the Midland followed the practice common on American railways of putting the role of Motive Power Superintendent (responsible for managing and allocating the railway&#x27;s locomotive stock in service) under the authority of the Operating Department (with overall responsibility for managing the railway&#x27;s services and timetables in response to demand) rather than the role being subordinate to the Chief Mechanical Engineer (responsible for providing and maintaining locomotives) as was usual in British railway companies. This had the effect of Midland locomotive policy from approximately 1910, further formalising the concept of more frequent, lighter trains hauled by relatively small locomotives - a situation which favoured the goal of the Operating Department (greater frequency, flexibility and overall volume of services) at the expense of the Motive Power Superintendent&#x27;s natural preference for a smaller number of more powerful locomotives (a smaller number of more easily-managed, less labour-intensive assets performing the same work) or the ability of the Derby works (under the CME) to design such locomotives. 

Smaller, less powerful engines also allowed savings in civil engineering upgrades as they permitted lighter-laid track and cheaper bridges to be retained for longer into the 20th century - thus there is an interaction with Route Availability - primarily based on axle loadings - although this concept was not formalised into classifications in Midland or LMS days (contrast to the Great Western Railway, q.v.). In turn this acted against the widespread adoption of larger, heavier engines as this would require a simultaneous large-scale civil engineering programme to improve the Midland&#x27;s permanent way and associated structures. Similarly, the Midland was unusual among British railways by continuing to favour roundhouses to stable and service its locomotives instead of the more common longitudinal shed. While a shed could be relatively easy expanded and lengthened to accommodate larger locomotives, the roundhouses could not, further adding a secondary cost to adopting large engines. Another such factor was that decades of running light, short trains meant that the Midland&#x27;s network featured shorter-than-average sidings and passing loops - if more powerful locomotives were to be procured and used to the full, these would have to be rebuilt to work with longer trains.

The small engine policy served the Midland well when its network was confined to the English Midlands, which is largely free of steep gradients. As the company expanded into other parts of Britain the policy&#x27;s downsides began to cause problems. The company&#x27;s own main line to Scotland (the Settle-Carlisle Line) and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (where the Midland was responsible for providing locomotives) were renowned for their steep gradients and the company&#x27;s locomotive stock proved badly suited to the task. Nonetheless the small engine policy remained and double-heading or banking was used to make up for the shortfall in power. The policy also greatly reduced capacity on the Midland&#x27;s network as not only were there more (but smaller) trains than there would have been on another railway but further capacity was taken up by the need to accommodate light engines that had been used for piloting or banking duties that were returning to their depots. The small engine policy was a contributing factor to two fatal accidents on the Settle-Carlisle Line, at Hawes Junction and Ais Gill. In the former case it was due to excessive light-engine movements and in the latter due to a train stalling on the main line due to a lack of power.

===The End of the Policy===
The small engine policy remained in place into the 1920s and remained an influence during the early years of the Midland&#x27;s successor the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, its Chief Mechanical Engineer for most of the 1920s being Henry Fowler, a long-standing Midland engineer and former CME of that company. James Anderson was made Chief Motive Power Superintendent of the new LMS. Anderson was also from the Midland, was a trained locomotive engineer, had been draughtsman and works manager at Derby Works and had been appointed temporary CME of the Midland when Fowler was seconded to the British government to manage wartime production of munitions and aircraft. The corporate management structure of the Midland, with the Operating Department overseeing the role of the Motive Power Superintendent, continued in a somewhat de facto fashion in the early years of the LMS.

Midland-era standard designs were continued or lightly updated and constructed for use across the new LMS network. Many of these types proved ill-suited or inadequate for routes and operating practices away from ex-Midland territory - while ex-Midland locomotives were imposed on the new LMS, the operational practices that went with them were not, on top of still-rising demands with regard to train speeds and weights. This left Midland-designed &#x27;small engines&#x27; being worked to the full on heavy trains by crews used to working their engines as hard as possible. Under these conditions many of the designs proved inadequate in terms of both performance and reliability (such as the frequent axle bearing failures afflicting many ex-Midland LMS engines in the 1920s) and this left the LMS with a shortage of modern motive power by the late 1920s. Fowler oversaw the introduction of the Royal Scot class locomotives in 1927, which effectively ended the Midland small engine tradition - they were in fact built by the North British Locomotive Company which also had a large part in the design process, further assisted by plans of the Southern Railway&#x27;s Lord Nelson class being provided to the LMS. Fowler was succeeded by William Stanier in 1932 who brought in a new generation of modern &#x27;large engine&#x27; designs, greatly influenced by his previous employer, the Great Western Railway.

== Numbering and classification ==
Before 1907, locomotive numbering was somewhat erratic. New locomotives might take the numbers of old engines, which were placed on the duplicate list and had an A suffix added to their numbers. In 1907, the whole stock were renumbered in a systematic way, each class in a consecutive sequence, classes being ordered by type (passenger/tank/goods), power and age. After the grouping
this system was adapted for the whole LMS.

The Midland classified their stock into three classes numbered 1 to 3 with 1 the least powerful and 3 the most. Stock was also split into passenger and freight engines. When the two largest 4-4-0 classes (the 3-cylinder compounds and the &quot;999s&quot;) were introduced, these were put into Class 4. This system formed the basis for the subsequent LMS and BR classification systems.

== Engines inherited from constituent companies ==
The Midland Railway formed in 1844 from the Midland Counties Railway, the North Midland Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, and took over a number of others including the Leicester and Swannington Railway and the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway.

== Engines built by the Midland==
Initially, the Midland concentrated on maintaining and improving the somewhat varied fleet that it had inherited, with the assistance of The Railway Foundry in Leeds. In addition, it bought in twenty-four of their Jenny Lind locomotives and, in 1848, two unique Crampton locomotives.
=== Ex- LT&amp;SR (1912-1922) ===
In 1912 the Midland bought the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway, but this continued to be operated more or less separately. The Midland, and the LMS subsequently built some LT&amp;SR designs.

== Liveries ==

Prior to 1883 painted green. After 1883 the Midland adopted its distinctive crimson lake livery for passenger engines.

== Influence on LMS locomotive policy ==

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) continued the Midland&#x27;s small engine policy until William Stanier arrived in 1933. The last new Midland design was Stanier 0-4-4T of 1932/3 but some Fowler 4Fs were constructed as late as 1941.

<text>Portsmouth Football Club is a professional association football club based in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. The team is currently competing in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system in the 2024–25 season after winning the 2023–24 EFL League One title. Portsmouth are nicknamed Pompey, a local nickname used by both His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base, Portsmouth and the city of Portsmouth. The club adopted blue shirts in 1912 and have mostly used a combination of white shorts and red socks since 1946.

Founded on 5 April 1898, Portsmouth began their early history in the Southern and Western leagues, before being elected into the English Football League and newly formed Third Division in 1920. Portsmouth won two promotions in 1924 and 1927 to reach the First Division, becoming the first football club south of London to do so. After finishing runners-up in two FA Cup finals in 1929 and 1934, Portsmouth won for the first time in 1939. Normal professional football in England was suspended in September 1939 because of the outbreak of World War II, meaning Portsmouth retained the FA Cup trophy for seven consecutive years (the record) until the 1946 FA Cup final. 

After World War II, Portsmouth became League Champions of England in two successive 1948–49 and 1949–50 First Division seasons. However, Portsmouth&#x27;s 32 consecutive years in the First Division ended with relegation to the Second Division in 1959 and was followed by another relegation to the Third Division in 1961. In 1978, Portsmouth were relegated to the Fourth Division (formed in 1958) for the first time before earning three promotions in 1980, 1983 and 1987. After one brief season in the 1987-88 First Division, Portsmouth would remain in the second tier between 1988 until 2003.

Portsmouth became champions of the 2002–03 Football League First Division (restructured as the second tier in 1992) and were promoted to the Premier League. Portsmouth won the FA Cup for a second time in the 2008 FA Cup final. Portsmouth&#x27;s seven-year stay in the Premier League ended in 2009–10 with relegation, signalling the beginning of a difficult period where the club entered financial administration twice and were relegated three times. After the club was purchased by the Pompey Supporters Trust in 2013, Pompey would begin to recover financially and won the League Two title in 2016–17 and the League One title in 2023–24.

Portsmouth are one of only five English football clubs to have been champions of all four tiers of the professional English football pyramid. Portsmouth&#x27;s arch-rivals are Southampton, a rivalry based in part on geographic proximity and both cities&#x27; respective maritime histories. Portsmouth are also the only professional football club in England which is not located on mainland Great Britain, as the city of Portsmouth and their Fratton Park home football ground are located on Portsea Island.

==History==


===1898–1920: Founding of Portsmouth F.C. and early years===

Portsmouth F.C. were formed on 5 April 1898, at 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth, as &quot;The Portsmouth Football and Athletic Company&quot;, with John Brickwood as chairman. Although the founding of Portsmouth F.C. had been agreed on 5 April 1898, a football ground or a team of players did not exist until 1899.

In 1899, work began on developing a plot of former agricultural land near Goldsmith Avenue, Milton, Portsmouth into a new football ground, bought in 1898 from the local Goldsmith farming family. The new football ground was to be named Fratton Park after the nearby and convenient Fratton railway station. Frank Brettell was announced as Portsmouth Football Club&#x27;s first manager-secretary in February 1899. A bold and ambitious application for Portsmouth&#x27;s direct entry into the Southern League First Division, without the usual probationary period in the lower divisions, was accepted, and the club joined the Southern Football League Division One for the 1899–1900 season. 

Portsmouth&#x27;s first 1899–1900 season in the Southern Football League Division One was successful, with the club winning 20 out of 28 league matches, earning them the runner-up spot in the table behind champions, Tottenham Hotspur. In their second 1900–01 Southern Football League Division One season, Portsmouth finished in third place and joined the 1900–01 Western Football League, where they finished as Division One champions. Portsmouth won the 1901–02 Southern Football League championship title but were not promoted. In the 1902–03 Western Football League, Portsmouth won the Division One championship for a third consecutive season.

In the 1906–07 Western Football League, the top Division One was split into equal &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; sections, with a play-off between the two section winners to decide a Division One champion. In their last Western Football League appearance, Portsmouth finished in fourth position of the &#x27;B&#x27; section of Division One. At the end of the season, all fourteen members of the split &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; sections of Division One resigned from the Western Football League. Portsmouth ended their season in sixth place before the following season saw the team relegated. A severe financial crisis struck between seasons and a public appeal for funds in May 1911 kept the club afloat.

The team finished second place in the 1911–12 Southern Football League Division Two and were promoted as runners-up. However, the club&#x27;s finances were in trouble again, with losses and debts increasing to £10,000. A shareholders meeting was called on 8 May 1912, where George Lewin Oliver, one of the original founders and directors, proposed that &quot;&quot;The Portsmouth Football and Athletic Company&quot; should be wound up and replaced with a more business orientated company. The original company was then liquidated to remove the debt and on 27 July 1912, the &quot;Portsmouth Football Company Ltd&quot;&quot; was formed as the new parent company of Portsmouth F.C., with substantial financial guarantees given by the board of directors. The original 1898 founding director George Lewin Oliver became the new Portsmouth F.C. chairman.

Football was suspended during the First World War. Following the resumption of matches in the 1919–20 season, Portsmouth won the Southern League championship for the second time. Portsmouth were then elected to the Football League Third Division as founder members.

===1920–1939: Establishment in Football League, FA Cup triumph===
Competing in the Football League Third Division, Portsmouth claimed the title in the 1923–24 season. Debuting in the Second Division for the first time, they finished in fourth place. Portsmouth won promotion to the First Division by finishing runners-up in the 1926–27 season and in the process, recording their club record win in a 9–1 victory over Notts County. Portsmouth&#x27;s debut season in the 1927–28 First Division was a struggle, finishing one point and one place above relegation. Despite their difficulties in the top flight, Portsmouth reached the FA Cup final for the first time, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers in 1929. 

From 1929 to 1934, Portsmouth had become a regular top-half table finisher in the First Division. The 1933–34 season saw Portsmouth again reach the FA Cup final for a second time but lost to Manchester City. Having established themselves in the top flight, the 1938–39 season saw Portsmouth reach the FA Cup final. This was indeed third time lucky, as Portsmouth managed to defeat Wolverhampton Wanderers 4–1. The start of World War II in 1939 resulted in the suspension of the FA Cup competition for the duration, so Portsmouth held the trophy until it resumed in 1945–46.

The new 1939–40 season was cut short with the start of World War Two. However, football competitions did take place during the war, with the Football League being split into ten regional mini leagues, with Portsmouth in &#x27;League South&#x27; along with an annual national cup competition, the Football League War Cup. In 1942, Portsmouth reached the London War Cup final. Portsmouth progressed to the 1942 London War Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but were beaten by Brentford. During his wartime visits to Portsmouth, Field Marshal Montgomery became interested in Portsmouth Football Club and was made honorary President of Portsmouth F.C. in 1944 (until 1961).

===1946–1979: Post-war years===
The Football League finally resumed in 1946–47. Portsmouth won the First Division title in the 1948–49 season. Bob Jackson&#x27;s Portsmouth side beat Aston Villa 5–1 on the last day of the following 1949–50 season, winning the Football League title again for a second consecutive season – on goal average. In the following 1950–51 season, Portsmouth finished in 7th position. After narrowly avoiding relegation in previous seasons, Portsmouth finished bottom of the First Division at the end of the 1958–59 season, ending their 32-year stay in the First Division.

In the 1960–61 season Portsmouth finished second-to-last place in the Second Division relegation zone and were relegated once again to the Third Division. Under the guidance of George Smith, Portsmouth were promoted back to the Second Division at the first time of asking, winning the Third Division title. Despite limited financial means, manager George Smith maintained Portsmouth&#x27;s Second Division status throughout the rest of the 1960s. Portsmouth finished bottom of the Second Division in the 1975–76 season and were relegated down to the Third Division. In November of the 1976–77 Third Division season, the club found itself needing to raise £25,000 to pay off debts and so avoid bankruptcy. With players having to be sold to ease the club&#x27;s financial situation, and no money available for replacements, Portsmouth were forced to rely on inexperienced young players and ended the 1976–77 season only one place and one point above the Third Division&#x27;s relegation zone but were relegated at the end of the new 1977–78 season, finishing in bottom place. 

===1979–2003===

Under Frank Burrows&#x27; new management, Portsmouth gained promotion back to the Third Division after finishing in 4th place in the 1979–80 season. Portsmouth would take three seasons before in 1983, Portsmouth claimed their Third Division championship title, gaining promotion back into the Second Division. In the 1986–87 Second Division season, Portsmouth finished as runners-up behind Derby County, gaining promotion back to the First Division for the first time since the 1958–59 season. By the middle of the new 1987–88 First Division season, the club was again in financial trouble with the ground in a poor condition. Portsmouth were relegated straight back down to the Second Division. The summer of 1988 saw chairman John Deacon sell the club to London-based businessman and former Queens Park Rangers chairman, Jim Gregory.

The club&#x27;s parent company had a name change from &#x27;Portsmouth Football Company Limited&#x27; to &#x27;Portsmouth Football Club Limited&#x27; on 23 January 1989. Portsmouth ended the season only two places above the relegation zone. The 1992–93 Football League season saw a major restructuring of the English football &quot;pyramid&quot; system, with the new FA Premier League becoming the new first tier and the First Division becoming the second tier. Therefore, Portsmouth played in the new &quot;First Division&quot; but missed out on automatic promotion by virtue of scoring only one fewer goal than second-placed West Ham United. In the subsequent promotion play-offs, Portsmouth lost 3–2 on aggregate to Leicester City.

Terry Venables took over as chairman in February 1997 after buying a 51 per cent controlling share in the club for £1. Venables sold his shareholding back to Martin Gregory in 1998. Alan Ball then returned as manager for the second time on 26 January 1998. Relegation to the third tier was avoided on the last day of the season – by 1 point. Portsmouth&#x27;s centenary season, 1998–99, saw a financial crisis hit the club, and in December 1998 Portsmouth went into financial administration. Serbian-born US businessman Milan Mandarić decided to buy Portsmouth in May 1999. Alan Ball was sacked on 9 December 1999 during the 1999–2000 season with the club near the bottom of the table. Tony Pulis steered the club to safety. Portsmouth escaped relegation on the last day of the 2000–01 season when they won their final game and Huddersfield Town lost theirs, keeping Portsmouth up at their expense. A week before the new season began, 25-year-old Portsmouth goalkeeper Aaron Flahavan was killed in a car crash on 5 August 2001 with the club retiring his number 1 shirt for the season. Harry Redknapp became manager in 2002. After a 17th-place finish, he led Pompey to the First Division title in 2002–03, after an absence of fifteen seasons from the first tier.

===2003–2017: Premier League and decline===
In Portsmouth&#x27;s Premiership debut season in 2003–04, the partnership of Harry Redknapp and Jim Smith resulted in a 13th place final position at the end of the season. Almost halfway through the following 2004–05 season in the Premiership, Harry Redknapp unexpectedly walked out on Portsmouth in November 2004 after a row with chairman Milan Mandarić. Velimir Zajec then replaced Redknapp as Portsmouth manager, but in April 2005, Zajec was replaced by Frenchman Alain Perrin. Perrin managed to secure Portsmouth&#x27;s Premiership status with a few games of the season left. During the 2005–06 season, Alain Perrin was sacked with Harry Redknapp then making a surprise return to manage Portsmouth again after leaving relegated Southampton. In January 2006, Portsmouth were sold by Milan Mandarić and bought by businessman Alexandre Gaydamak. The club survived their third season in the Premier League one place above the relegation zone in 17th position. With large amounts of money available for Redknapp to make record signings, the club finished the 2006–07 season in the top half of the table for the first time since their promotion, in ninth position. 

The following 2007–08 season, Portsmouth finished eighth in the Premier League and defeated Cardiff City in the FA Cup final 1–0. This marked the club’s first FA Cup final since 1939.
The FA Cup win had also earned Portsmouth a place in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, the club&#x27;s first time playing European football. On 25 October 2008, Redknapp left Portsmouth for a second time, leaving his assistant Tony Adams to be promoted to the managerial role. On 27 November 2008, Portsmouth drew 2–2 with AC Milan, going 2–0 up, but conceding two goals later in the game. Adams was dismissed in February 2009. Youth team coach Paul Hart took over as manager until the end of the season, eventually finishing in 14th place. Because of the financial problems suffered by the club, Portsmouth were forced to sell several of their top players and high earners. Al Fahim completed the takeover on 26 August 2009. As the early stages of the 2009–10 season progressed, the finances dried up and the club admitted on 1 October that some of their players and staff had not been paid. Owing to the financial difficulties, the Premier League placed the club under a transfer embargo.

Avram Grant took over at Portsmouth on 26 November 2009, following the dismissal of Hart. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) filed a winding-up petition against Portsmouth at the High Court of Justice on 23 December 2009. In March 2010, this winding-up petition was dropped, leaving Portsmouth with a nine-point penalty for entering administration.

The club were later relegated but competed in the 2010 FA Cup final losing to Chelsea. Despite being FA Cup finalists, the club were denied a licence to play European football the following season in the UEFA Europa League. On 17 August, Balram Chainrai completed his takeover of the club.

In October 2010, it was revealed just hours later that Portsmouth had finally come out of administration, with Balram Chainrai regaining control of the company. On 1 June 2011, Convers Sports Initiatives (CSI) owned by Russian Vladimir Antonov completed its takeover of the club, although an arrest warrant would later be issued for him in November 2011 following allegations of asset stripping. He shortly afterwards resigned as chairman of Portsmouth after parent company CSI entered administration. On 17 February 2012, Portsmouth went into administration for the second time in two years, bringing them an automatic 10-point deduction. They were relegated from the Championship in 2011–12, the first time in 30 years that the club had played in the third tier.

Following Pompey&#x27;s relegation to League One, the entire professional playing squad left the club. The team were given a 10-point deduction in December 2012 for their financial issues. On 9 November 2012, Chanrai halted his attempt to buy the club. Six days later, the Pompey Supporters Trust signed a conditional agreement with PFK to buy the club. The club went on a record winless run of 23 matches during the season. On 10 April 2013, a deal with administrators was reached, although the Pompey Supporters&#x27; Trust had not yet finalised the purchase. Portsmouth were relegated again at the end of the season, to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in 33 years. On 19 April 2013, Portsmouth exited administration when the Pompey Supporters&#x27; Trust (PST) deal to buy the club was completed.

The 2013–14 season was also a turbulent one for Pompey with a high turnover of managers. With the club in serious danger of relegation to non-League, Andy Awford was again made caretaker manager and guided the club away from the drop. In a historic announcement on 29 September 2014, the club was able to declare itself debt-free after paying back all creditors and legacy payments to ex-players. Following an unsuccessful 2014–15 campaign, Paul Cook was appointed new manager of Portsmouth on 12 May 2015. Following an unsuccessful play-off attempt in the previous season, Paul Cook&#x27;s side secured promotion to League One in 2016–17 with a 3–1 win away at Notts County and were later confirmed as champions. However, Paul Cook resigned on 31 May 2017 to join Wigan Athletic.

===2017–present===
In May 2017, the Pompey Supporters&#x27; Trust (PST) voted in favour of a proposed bid by The Tornante Company, headed by former Disney chief executive Michael Eisner, to take over the club which was completed on 3 August 2017. Portsmouth finished their first season back in League One in 8th position. In the following season, they won the EFL Trophy, defeating Sunderland on penalties in the final but lost to the same team in the play-offs.

Portsmouth were due to return to Wembley to defend the EFL Trophy against Salford City on 5 April 2020 in the final, however, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the suspension of the season on 13 March. After the league was suspended, a points per game calculation meant that Pompey competed in the play-offs, albeit behind closed doors. Nevertheless, they lost on penalties to Oxford United.

The delayed 2020 EFL Trophy final was eventually played behind closed doors at Wembley Stadium in March 2021, with Portsmouth losing on penalties to Salford City. After three seasons finishing just below the play-off positions, they won promotion in the 2023–24 season as champions, ending their 12-year stay below the second tier.
==Club identity==
===Club badge===
Although Portsmouth F.C. were formed in 1898, the club did not have a club badge until one was introduced for the 1913–14 season. The official Coat of Arms of the City of Portsmouth contains an eight pointed gold star and crescent moon on a blue shield, Portsmouth&#x27;s adoption of the star and crescent is said to have come from when King Richard I (1157–1189), who granted the city &quot;a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points&quot; which he had taken from the Byzantine Emperor&#x27;s standard of Governor Isaac Komnenos, after capturing Cyprus.

The first 1913 Portsmouth F.C. badge was based on official symbols belonging to the town council of Portsmouth, which featured a golden eight-pointed star and a golden crescent moon. The club&#x27;s first badge featured a horizontally elongated white crescent moon beneath a white five pointed star, with both symbols positioned in the centre of a blue four pointed shield. Portsmouth town council bestowed the privileged use (but not ownership) of their moon and star motifs to Portsmouth F.C., albeit with some colour and design changes.

Throughout their history Portsmouth F.C. have tried different variations of the badge. After World War II, Portsmouth began using an eight-pointed star to match that used by the city of Portsmouth. In the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional badge was emblazoned on the shirt in white rather than gold but this was due to white being a cheaper alternative to a more expensive gold coloured thread. Between 1980 and 1989, Portsmouth scrapped their traditional star and crescent badge and replaced it with an entirely new design. This badge showed a football in front of an anchor (representing the Royal Navy) and a sword (representing the British Army), with the whole design surrounded by an outer ring of ships rope. An alternative version included a circular version of the traditional star and crescent badge in place of the football.

During 1989 and 1993, the sword and anchor badge was dropped replaced with a simpler eight pointed star and crescent moon on a long narrow shield. From 1993 until 1997, the 1989–93 long narrow shield design was replaced by an embroidered badge of the city of Portsmouth Coat of Arms. The 1993–97 city arms badge was replaced in 1997, with an eight pointed gold star and a golden crescent moon on a blue shield edged with a gold outer rim. This new badge coincided with the centennial anniversary in the 1997–98 season.

On 6 May 2008, Portsmouth revealed a new badge with &quot;three points&quot; at the top of the shield were replaced with two straightened angles, with &quot;Portsmouth F.C.&quot; written above the star on the shield. The traditional elongated crescent moon was replaced with a new circular one, which closely resembled that on the city&#x27;s Coat of Arms. The new badge had its debut in the 2008 FA Cup final, in which Portsmouth also wore a new 110th Anniversary all-blue commemorative home strip. As part of the World War I Centennial Commemorations in the 2014–15 season, the club opted to temporarily replace the badge with a more traditional badge. In June 2015, Portsmouth reverted the official club badge back to a traditional design.

On 4 May 2017, during a meeting between the Tornante Company the Supporters Trust, the prospective new owners identified a long overlooked ownership and copyright issue concerning the traditional Portsmouth badge – Portsmouth Football Club did not legally &quot;own&quot; the symbols on the badge, which had actually only been &quot;on loan&quot; to the club from Portsmouth City Council since 1913. On 15 March 2018, two newly redesigned club badges were finally revealed ahead of the 2018–19 season (one for players&#x27; shirts and the other for commercial purposes).

===Home colours===

In the 1899–1900 season, Portsmouth&#x27;s first home colours were salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, matched with white shorts and black socks. The pink shirts gave the early Portsmouth F.C. the alternative second nickname of &#x27;The Shrimps&#x27;. The collars and cuffs were the same colour as the Corporation of Portsmouth&#x27;s public trams, which were painted maroon at the time. These colours lasted until the end of the 1908–09 season. At the start of the 1909–10 season, Portsmouth changed to white shirts with navy blue shorts and navy blue socks.

For the start of the 1912–13 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed their home colours to azure blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth&#x27;s home kit colour combination up until the start of the 1933–34 season, when the shirts were changed to a royal blue. These colours remained until the start of the 1947–48 season, when the black socks were changed to red; this coinciding with the club&#x27;s most successful period and has remained the favoured colours for the majority of the time since. Portsmouth F.C. changed their colour combination several times during the 1966–1976 period, before reverting to the now tradition post-war blue shirts, white shorts and red stockings in 1976. For the club&#x27;s 110th anniversary season in 2008–09, Portsmouth played in an all blue home kit, which debuted in the previous season&#x27;s successful 2008 FA Cup final win. Since the 2009–10 season, Portsmouth reverted to the now traditional blue-white-red home kit.

====Red socks memorial====

Portsmouth had predominantly worn black socks since their first match in 1899. During the Second World War and post-war periods, the British Army&#x27;s Field Marshal Sir Bernard &#x27;Monty&#x27; Montgomery had been based at Southwick House, 5 miles to the north of Portsmouth. Montgomery regularly attended Pompey matches at Fratton Park, becoming the honorary President of Portsmouth Football Club. Following the suggestion by Montgomery, red socks were introduced by the club as a memorial to soldiers lost in wartime as red is the traditional colour of the British Army and also the colour of the Remembrance poppy. This also gave the Portsmouth team a patriotic blue, white and red appearance similar to the United Kingdom&#x27;s red white and blue Union Flag. The new red socks also coincided with Portsmouth&#x27;s most successful period, so the red socks were retained for good luck.

===Away colours===
The most frequent away colours used by Portsmouth have been white shirts with royal or navy blue shorts and either blue or white socks.

===Other historic kits===

For the 2008 FA Cup final victory against Cardiff City, Portsmouth debuted an all blue home kit manufactured by Canterbury and sponsored by Oki Printing Solutions to commemorate the club&#x27;s 110th Anniversary year. The all blue home kit was also used throughout the following 2008–09 season.

Portsmouth again reached the FA Cup final in 2010, but were defeated 1–0 by Chelsea. Portsmouth, as the away team, wore a white and maroon kit inspired from elements of the original &quot;Shrimps&quot; era (1899–1909) kit in which maroon collars and cuffs featured on the salmon pink home shirts.

===&quot;Pompey&quot; nickname===

The traditional nickname of the Portsmouth Football Club is Pompey, a nickname already long associated with the English city of Portsmouth and its Royal Navy base. An exact origin for the &quot;Pompey&quot; nickname has never formally been identified by historians, as many variations and interpretations of the &quot;Pompey&quot; nickname exist.

==Ground==


Portsmouth play their home games at Fratton Park, in the Portsmouth suburb of Milton. The football ground has been home to the club throughout its entire history. The football ground was formerly the site of a potato field in 1898 when it was purchased by the newly-formed &quot;Portsmouth Football &amp; Athletic Company&quot;.

Fratton Park was designed and completed during 1899 by Portsmouth director and architect Alfred Bone and was first opened to the public on 15 August 1899. The early Fratton Park of 1899 only had one roofed all-seat stand on the pitch&#x27;s southern side. The first ever football match to take place at Fratton Park was a friendly against Southampton, played on 6 September 1899, with Portsmouth winning 2–0. The first competitive match at Fratton Park was played three days later on 9 September 1899; a Southern League Division One match against Reading, which Portsmouth also won 2–0.

In 1905, the club expanded Fratton Park, adding a mock Tudor style club pavilion to the south-west corner in Frogmore Road, a pavilion designed by Alfred Bone. The pavilion originally featured a tall octagonal clock tower spire on its north-east corner, with an upper viewing gallery built beneath it giving an unobscured view over the entire Fratton Park pitch. In addition, two new solid earthbank terraces, topped with cinders and wooden planking were built behind the two goal ends. They were initially known as the &quot;Fratton Railway End&quot; and &quot;Milton End&quot; (or &quot;Spion Kop&quot;) and were built behind the west and east end goal lines respectively.

The pavilion&#x27;s clock tower was demolished in the 1920s as the South Stand was partially built into the pavilion&#x27;s footprint and still contains most of the pavilion&#x27;s original east side within it. Ten years later in 1935, Archibald Leitch also designed a larger North Stand for Fratton Park. Fratton Park reached its current all-time ground attendance record of 51,385 supporters on 26 February 1949, for an FA Cup sixth-round match, a 2–1 win against Derby County. The Fratton Railway End was demolished in 1956 and replaced by a new prefabricated concrete and steel stand, simply known as &quot;The Fratton End&quot;. Fratton Park became an all seated football ground in 1996, which greatly reduced Fratton Park&#x27;s previous maximum capacity. In 1997, a new Fratton End was opened in October 1997. Plans for relocation were first mooted in the early 1990s, but due to various objections and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park.

==Training ground==

Portsmouth F.C. have been using their training ground at 442 Copnor Road (PO3 5EW) in the Hilsea area of Portsea Island since 2014. The facilities in Hilsea were formerly a ROKO health club until Portsmouth F.C. purchased them on 16 June 2021. The main ex-ROKO health club building has since been refurbished into &#x27;Pompey Health And Fitness&#x27; members club, whose facilities are also used by Portsmouth F.C.″s squad.

==Rivalries and supporters==
Portsmouth&#x27;s main rivals are Southampton, who are 19.8 miles (31.8 km) away. The South Coast Derby is one of the less frequently played rivalries within English football due to the clubs being in different divisions; however this usually adds to the ferocity of the fixture.

Prior to the mid-late 1960s, rivalry between Portsmouth and Southampton was largely non-existent, as a consequence of their disparity in league status. This derby match has been sporadic. Since 1977, the teams have only been in the same division in four seasons: 1987–88, 2003–04, 2004–05 and 2011–12. As of June 2024, the two clubs have met 71 times in all competitions with Pompey winning on 21 occasions, Southampton winning 35 times and with 15 matches finishing level. The most recent fixture between the two sides came in September 2019 in the EFL Cup with Southampton winning 4–0 at Fratton Park.

Many Portsmouth supporters commonly use the derogatory nickname Scummer (plural: Scummers) to describe Southampton fans, or collectively Scum to also include their football club, and indeed the city of Southampton itself. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;Scummers&quot; was a derogatory name with naval origins for pirates or buccaneers, and was first recorded in use in 1585.

Meanwhile, Portsmouth supporters have had the equally derogatory nickname Skate bestowed upon them by Southampton fans as a rebuttal to &quot;Scummer&quot; since the 1987–88 Division One season. This was unofficially chosen by Southampton fans from a list of insults compiled by a Southampton-based supporters fanzine called &quot;The Ugly Inside&quot; in 1988. Ironically, the chosen nickname &quot;Skate&quot; was actually stolen from the civilian population of Portsmouth, who had long used &quot;Skate&quot; as a derogatory insult or nickname for sailors based in Portsmouth Dockyard and other Royal Navy establishments.

Another rivalry over the years, known as the &quot;Dockyard Derby&quot; by the media, is with Plymouth Argyle. This rivalry is also known as the Battle of the Ports. In recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with Sunderland, mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 2018–19 season.

===&#x27;The Pompey Chimes&#x27;===
The best-known chant sung by Portsmouth supporters are &quot;The Pompey Chimes&quot;. The chant is regarded as one of the oldest football chants still in use today.

&quot;The Pompey Chimes&quot; were originally called &quot;The Town Hall Chimes&quot;, and were created by the supporters of Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Football Club, a British Army artillery regiment team, who were the most popular and successful amateur football team based in Portsmouth for much of the 1890s. Royal Artillery played their home matches at the United Services Recreation Ground in Burnaby Road, Portsmouth, and were already nicknamed &quot;Pompey&quot; before the founding of Portsmouth F.C. in 1898.

The nearby Portsmouth Town Hall, only 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from Burnaby Road was completed in 1890, and would strike the various Westminster Quarters chimes every quarter hour. Football referees would use the Town Hall&#x27;s clock bells as a reference to when the football match should end at 4 pm. Just before 4 pm the crowd of supporters would sing in unison with the Town Hall&#x27;s chimes on the hour to encourage the referee to blow the whistle to signify full-time. The original words to &quot;The Pompey Chimes&quot; (as printed in the 1900–01 Official Handbook of Portsmouth F.C.), were:

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; {\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;tubular bells&quot; \time 5/4 \key e \major e4 gis fis b,2 | e4 fis gis e2 | gis4 e fis b,2 | b4 fis&#x27; gis e2 | R1*5/4\fermata \bar &quot;||&quot; \clef bass \time 4/4 e,1^&quot;Portsmouth Town Hall Chimes (4pm)&quot; | e1| e1 | e1 |}&lt;/score&gt;
&quot;Play up Pompey,&quot;
&quot;Just one more goal!&quot; 
&quot;Make tracks! What ho!&quot;
&quot;Hallo! Hallo!!&quot;

With the demise of Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C. after their expulsion from the 1898–99 FA Amateur Cup for alleged professionalism, many of Royal Artillery&#x27;s supporters switched their allegiance in 1899 to Portsmouth F.C., taking the &quot;Town Hall Chimes&quot; chant and the &quot;Pompey&quot; nickname from Burnaby Road to Fratton Park, a distance of 1.8 miles (2.8 km).

The Pompey Chimes are still sung at Fratton Park today, and have evolved to be sung at a quicker tempo, and with a shortened chime style – usually twice:

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; {\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;tubular bells&quot; \time 5/4 \key e \major gis4 e fis b,2 | b4 fis&#x27; gis e2 | gis4 e fis b,2 | b4 fis&#x27; gis e2 |}&lt;/score&gt;

&quot;Play up Pompey,&quot;
&quot;Pompey play up!&quot;
&quot;Play up Pompey,&quot;
&quot;Pompey play up!&quot;

It is most common to hear The Chimes sung by Portsmouth supporters as an encouragement to the Portsmouth team, more specifically before the Portsmouth players take set-piece kicks.

===Portsmouth Hall of Fame===
Portsmouth created a Hall of Fame in March 2009, which honours former players and staff members of the club. At a year-by-year ceremony, the club holds a day to announce the year&#x27;s inducted to the list, and also has a dinner for the people present.

The following players have been inducted into the Portsmouth Football Club Hall of Fame:

Key:
===Women&#x27;s team===
The club&#x27;s female counterpart is Portsmouth Women, which was founded in 1987. The team currently competes in the FA Women&#x27;s National League South and play at Havant &amp; Waterlooville&#x27;s stadium. Following the takeover of the club by the Portsmouth Supporters Trust, it was announced that there would be closer ties between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clubs.

On 5 June 2023, Portsmouth announced that their women&#x27;s team would integrate under The Tornate Company, meaning the side would be turning semi-professional for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

<doc id="564303" wikidata="Q232109" url="?curid=564303" title="Mary Astor">
<text>Mary Astor (born Lucile Vasconcellos Langhanke; May 3, 1906 – September 25, 1987) was an American actress. Although her career spanned several decades, she may be best remembered for her performance as Brigid O&#x27;Shaughnessy in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941).

Astor began her long motion picture career when a teenager in the silent movies of the early 1920s. When talkies arrived, her voice was initially considered too masculine and she was off the screen for a year. After she appeared in a play with friend Florence Eldridge, film offers returned, and she resumed her career in sound pictures.

In 1936, Astor&#x27;s career was nearly destroyed by scandal. She had an affair with playwright George S. Kaufman and was branded an adulterous wife by her former husband during a custody fight over their daughter. Overcoming these stumbling blocks in her private life, she went on to greater film success, eventually winning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of concert pianist Sandra Kovak in &quot;The Great Lie&quot; (1941).

Astor was a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player through most of the 1940s and continued to work in film, television and on stage until her retirement in 1964. She authored five novels. Her autobiography was a bestseller, as was her later book, &quot;A Life on Film&quot;, which was about her career.

Director Lindsay Anderson wrote of Astor in 1990 that when &quot;two or three who love the cinema are gathered together, the name of Mary Astor always comes up, and everybody agrees that she was an actress of special attraction, whose qualities of depth and reality always seemed to illuminate the parts she played.&quot;

== Life and career ==

Astor was born in Quincy, Illinois, the only child of Otto Ludwig Wilhelm Langhanke and Helen Marie de Vasconcellos. Her parents were teachers. Her German father emigrated to the United States from Berlin in 1891 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen; her American mother was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, and had Portuguese roots. They married on August 3, 1904, in Lyons, Kansas.

Astor&#x27;s father taught German at Quincy High School until the U.S. entered World War I. Later on, he took up light farming. Astor&#x27;s mother, who had always wanted to be an actress, taught drama and elocution. Astor was home-schooled in academics and was taught to play the piano by her father, who insisted she practice daily. Her piano talents came in handy when she played piano in her films &quot;The Great Lie&quot; and &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

In 1919, Astor sent a photograph of herself to a beauty contest in &quot;Motion Picture Magazine&quot;, becoming a semifinalist. When Astor was 15, the family moved to Chicago, Illinois, with her father teaching German in public schools. Astor took drama lessons and appeared in various amateur stage productions. The following year, she sent another photograph to &quot;Motion Picture Magazine&quot;, this time becoming a finalist and then runner-up in the national contest. Her father then moved the family to New York City, in order for his daughter to act in motion pictures. He managed her affairs from September 1920 to June 1930. 

A Manhattan photographer, Charles Albin, saw her photograph and asked the young girl with haunting eyes and long auburn hair whose nickname was &quot;Rusty&quot; to pose for him. The Albin photographs were seen by Harry Durant of Famous Players–Lasky and Astor was signed to a six-month contract with Paramount Pictures. Her name was changed to Mary Astor during a conference among Paramount Pictures chief Jesse Lasky, film producer Walter Wanger, and gossip columnist Louella Parsons. 

=== Silent movie career ===
Astor&#x27;s first screen test was directed by Lillian Gish, who was so impressed with her recitation of Shakespeare that she shot a thousand feet of film with her. 

She made her debut at age 14 in the 1921 film &quot;Sentimental Tommy&quot;, but her small part in a dream sequence wound up on the cutting room floor. Paramount let her contract lapse. She then appeared in some movie shorts with sequences based on famous paintings. She received critical recognition for the 1921 two-reeler &quot;The Beggar Maid&quot;. Her first feature-length movie was &quot;John Smith&quot; (1922), followed that same year by &quot;The Man Who Played God&quot;. In 1923, she and her parents moved to Hollywood.

After appearing in several larger roles at various studios, she was again signed by Paramount, this time to a one-year contract at $500 a week. After she appeared in several more movies, John Barrymore saw her photograph in a magazine and wanted her cast in his upcoming movie. On loan-out to Warner Bros., she starred with him in &quot;Beau Brummel&quot; (1924). The older actor wooed the young actress, but their relationship was severely constrained by Astor&#x27;s parents&#x27; unwillingness to let the couple spend time alone together; Mary was only seventeen and underage. It was only after Barrymore convinced the Langhankes that his acting lessons required privacy that the couple managed to be alone at all. Their secret engagement ended largely because of the Langhankes&#x27; interference and Astor&#x27;s inability to escape their heavy-handed authority, and because Barrymore became involved with Astor&#x27;s fellow WAMPAS Baby Star Dolores Costello, whom he later married. 

In 1925, Astor&#x27;s parents bought a Moorish style mansion with of land known as &quot;Moorcrest&quot; in the hills above Hollywood. The Langhankes not only lived lavishly off of Astor&#x27;s earnings, but kept her a virtual prisoner inside Moorcrest. Moorcrest is known not only for its ornate style, but its place as the most lavish residence associated with the Krotona Colony, a utopian society founded by the Theosophical Society in 1912. Built by Marie Russak Hotchener, a Theosophist who had no formal architectural training, the house combines Moorish and Mission Revival styles and contains such Arts and Crafts features as art-glass windows (whose red lotus design Astor called &quot;unfortunate&quot;), and Batchelder tiles. Moorcrest, which has since undergone a multimillion-dollar renovation, remains standing. Before the Langhankes bought it, it was rented by Charlie Chaplin, whose tenure is memorialized by an art glass window featuring the Little Tramp.
Astor&#x27;s parents were not Theosophists, though the family was friendly with both Marie Hotchener and her husband Harry, prominent Theosophical Society members. Hotchener negotiated Astor&#x27;s right to a $5 a week allowance (at a time when she was making $2,500 a week) and the right to go to work unchaperoned by her mother. The following year when she was 19, Astor, fed up with her father&#x27;s constant physical and psychological abuse as well as his control of her money, climbed from her second floor bedroom window and escaped to a hotel in Hollywood, as recounted in her memoirs. Hotchener facilitated her return by persuading Otto Langhanke to give Astor a savings account with $500 and the freedom to come and go as she pleased. Nevertheless, Astor did not gain control of her salary until she was 26 years old, at which point her parents sued her for financial support. Astor settled the case by agreeing to pay her parents $100 a month. Otto Langhanke put Moorcrest up for auction in the early 1930s, hoping to realize more than the $80,000 he had been offered for it; it sold for $25,000.

Astor continued to appear in movies at various studios. When her Paramount contract ended in 1925, she was signed at Warner Bros. Among her assignments was another role with John Barrymore, this time in &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1926). She was named one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1926, along with Mary Brian, Dolores Costello, Joan Crawford, Dolores del Río, Janet Gaynor, and Fay Wray. On loan to Fox Film Corporation, Astor starred in &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; (1928), which received good reviews, and the sophisticated comedy &quot;Dry Martini&quot; (also 1928). She later said that, while working on the latter, she &quot;absorbed and assumed something of the atmosphere and emotional climate of the picture.&quot; She said it offered &quot;a new and exciting point of view; with its specious doctrine of self-indulgence, it rushed into the vacuum of my moral sense and captivated me completely.&quot; When her Warner Bros. contract ended, she signed a contract with Fox for $3,750 a week. In 1928, she married director Kenneth Hawks at her family home, Moorcrest. He gave her a Packard automobile as a wedding present and the couple moved into a home high up on Lookout Mountain in Los Angeles above Beverly Hills. As the film industry made the transition to talkies, Fox gave her a sound test, which she failed because the studio found her voice to be too deep. Though this result was probably due to early sound equipment and inexperienced technicians, the studio released her from her contract and she found herself out of work for eight months in 1929.

=== New beginnings ===

During her time off, Astor took voice training and singing lessons with Francis Stuart, an exponent of Francesco Lamperti, but no roles were offered. Her acting career was then given a boost by her friend, Florence Eldridge, (wife of Fredric March), in whom she confided. Eldridge, who was to star in the stage play &quot;Among the Married&quot; at the Majestic Theatre in Downtown Los Angeles, recommended Astor for the second female lead. The play was a success, and her voice was deemed suitable, being described as low and vibrant. She was happy to work again, but her happiness soon ended. On January 2, 1930, while filming sequences for the Fox movie &quot;Such Men Are Dangerous&quot;, Kenneth Hawks was killed in a mid-air plane crash over the Pacific. Astor had just finished a matinee performance at the Majestic when Florence Eldridge gave her the news. She was rushed from the theatre to Eldridge&#x27;s apartment. A replacement, Doris Lloyd, stepped in for the next show. Astor remained with Eldridge at her apartment for some time, then soon returned to work. 

Shortly after her husband&#x27;s death, she debuted in her first talkie, &quot;Ladies Love Brutes&quot; (1930) at Paramount, in which she co-starred with her friend Fredric March. While her career picked up, her private life remained difficult. After working on several more movies, she suffered delayed shock over her husband&#x27;s death and had a nervous breakdown. During the months of her illness, she was attended to by Dr. Franklyn Thorpe, whom she married on June 29, 1931. That year, she starred as Nancy Gibson in &quot;Smart Woman&quot;, playing a woman determined to retrieve her husband from a gold-digging flirtation.

In May 1932, the Thorpes purchased a yacht and sailed to Hawaii. Astor was expecting a baby in August, but gave birth in June in Honolulu. The child, a daughter, was named Marylyn Hauoli Thorpe: her first name combined her parents&#x27; names, and her middle name is Hawaiian. When they returned to Southern California, Astor freelanced and gained the pivotal role of Barbara Willis in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Red Dust&quot; (1932) with Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. In late 1932, Astor signed a featured player contract with Warner Bros. Meanwhile, besides spending lavishly, her parents invested in the stock market, which often turned out unprofitable. While they remained in Moorcrest, Astor dubbed it a &quot;white elephant,&quot; and she refused to maintain the house. She had to turn to the Motion Picture Relief Fund in 1933 to pay her bills. She appeared as the female lead, Hilda Lake, niece of the murder victims, in &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot; (1933), co-starring with William Powell as detective Philo Vance. Film critic William K. Everson pronounced it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in the August 1984 issue of &quot;Films in Review.&quot;

Soon unhappy with her marriage, due to Thorpe having a short temper and a habit of listing her faults, by 1933 Astor wanted a divorce. At a friend&#x27;s suggestion, she took a break from movie-making in 1933 and visited New York alone. While there, enjoying a whirlwind social life, she met the playwright George S. Kaufman, who was in a strong, but open marriage. She documented their affair in her diary. Thorpe, by now making use of his wife&#x27;s income, discovered Astor&#x27;s diary, and told Astor that her liaisons with other men, including Kaufman, would be used in any divorce proceeding to support the charge that she was an unfit mother.

=== Custody case ===

Thorpe divorced Astor in April 1935. A custody battle over their four-year-old daughter, Marylyn, drew press attention to Astor in 1936. Astor&#x27;s diary was never formally offered as evidence during the trial, but Thorpe and his lawyers constantly referred to it, and its notoriety grew. Astor admitted that the diary existed and that she had documented her affair with Kaufman, but maintained that many of the parts that had been referred to were forgeries, following the theft of the diary from her desk. The diary was deemed inadmissible as a mutilated document because Thorpe had removed pages referring to himself and had fabricated content. The trial judge, Goodwin J. Knight, ordered it sealed and impounded. Florabel Muir, then with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, is known to have invented fabricated diary passages in her articles.

News of the diary became public when Astor&#x27;s role in &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936), as Edith Cortwright, was beginning to be filmed. Producer Samuel Goldwyn was urged to fire her because her contract included a morals clause. Goldwyn refused. With Walter Huston in the title role, &quot;Dodsworth&quot; received rave reviews on release, and the public&#x27;s acceptance assured the studios that casting Astor remained a viable proposition. Ultimately, the scandal caused minimal harm to Astor&#x27;s career, which was actually revitalized because of the custody fight and the publicity it generated.

In 1952, by court order, Astor&#x27;s diary was removed from the bank vault where it had been sequestered for 16 years, and was destroyed.

=== Mid-career ===
In 1937, Astor returned to the stage in well-received productions of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot;, &quot;The Astonished Heart&quot;, and &quot;Still Life&quot;. She also began performing regularly on radio. Over the next few years, she had roles on film in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937), John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937), &quot;Midnight&quot; (1939) and &quot;Brigham Young&quot; (1940). In John Huston’s classic &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), Astor played scheming temptress Brigid O&#x27;Shaughnessy. The film, based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett, also starred Humphrey Bogart and featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. For her performance in &quot;The Great Lie&quot; (also in 1941) she won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress in the 14th Academy Awards. As Sandra Kovak, the self-absorbed concert pianist who relinquishes her unborn child, her intermittent love interest was played by George Brent, but the film&#x27;s star was Bette Davis. Davis wanted Astor cast in the role after watching her screen test and seeing her play Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1. She then recruited Astor to collaborate on rewriting the script, which Davis felt was mediocre and needed work to make it more interesting. Astor further followed Davis&#x27;s advice and sported a bobbed hairdo for the role.

The soundtrack of the movie in the scenes where she plays the concerto, with violent hand movements on the piano keyboard, was dubbed by pianist Max Rabinovitch. Davis deliberately stepped back to allow Astor to shine in her key scenes. In her Oscar acceptance speech, Astor thanked Bette Davis and Tchaikovsky. Astor and Davis became good friends.

Astor was not propelled into the upper echelon of movie stars by these successes, however. She always declined offers to star in her own right. Not wanting the responsibility of top billing and having to carry the picture, she preferred the security of being a featured player. She reunited with Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Across the Pacific&quot; (1942). Though usually cast in dramatic or melodramatic roles, Astor showed a flair for comedy as The Princess Centimillia in the Preston Sturges film, &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; (also 1942) for Paramount. 

In February 1943, Astor&#x27;s father, Otto Langhanke, died in Cedars of Lebanon Hospital as a result of a heart attack complicated by influenza. His wife and daughter were at his bedside.

That same year, Astor signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), a move she soon came to regret. She was kept busy, playing what appeared to be under-written and largely interchangeable supporting roles, a category Astor later dubbed &quot;Mothers for Metro.&quot; After &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), the studio allowed her to debut on Broadway in &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; (1945). The play was a failure, but Astor received good reviews. On loan-out to 20th Century Fox, she played a wealthy widow in &quot;Claudia and David&quot; (1946). She was also loaned to Paramount to play Fritzi Haller in &quot;Desert Fury&quot; (1947), the tough owner of a saloon and casino in a small mining town. 

Before Helen Langhanke died of a heart ailment in January 1947, Astor said she sat in the hospital room with her mother, who was delirious and did not know her, and she listened quietly as her mother told her all about terrible, selfish Lucile, referring to Astor by her birth name. After her death, Astor said she spent countless hours copying her mother&#x27;s diary so she could read it and was surprised to learn how much she was hated. 

At MGM, Astor continued being cast in undistinguished, colorless mother roles. One exception was when she played a prostitute in the film noir &quot;Act of Violence&quot; (1948). The last straw came when she was cast as Marmee March in &quot;Little Women&quot; (1949). Astor found no redemption in playing what she considered another humdrum mother and grew despondent. She later described her disappointment with her cast members and the shoot in her memoir &quot;A Life on Film&quot;:

The studio wanted to renew her contract, promising better roles, but she declined the offer.

=== Middle years ===
At the same time, Astor&#x27;s drinking was growing troublesome. She admitted to alcoholism as far back as the 1930s, but it had never interfered with her work schedule or performance. She hit bottom in 1949 and went into a sanitarium for alcoholics.

In 1951, she made a frantic call to her priest and said that she had taken too many sleeping pills. She was taken to a hospital and the police reported that she had attempted suicide, this being her third overdose in two years. The story made headline news. She maintained it had been an accident.

That same year, she joined Alcoholics Anonymous and converted to Roman Catholicism. She credited her recovery to a priest, Peter Ciklic, also a practicing psychologist, who encouraged her to write about her experiences as part of therapy. She also separated from her fourth husband, Thomas Wheelock (a stockbroker she married on Christmas Day 1945), but did not actually divorce him until 1955.

In 1952, she was cast in the leading role of the play &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot;, which was later made into the movie &quot;Summertime&quot; (1955), and subsequently toured with it. After the tour, Astor lived in New York for four years and worked in the theater and on television. During the 1952 presidential election, Astor, a lifelong Democrat, supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson.

Her TV debut was in &quot;The Missing Years&quot; (1954) for &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;. She acted frequently in TV during the ensuing years and appeared on many big shows of the time, including &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, and &quot;Ben Casey&quot;. In 1954, she appeared in the episode &quot;Fearful Hour&quot; of the Gary Merrill NBC series &quot;Justice&quot; in the role of a desperately poor and aging film star who attempts suicide to avoid exposure as a thief. She also played an ex-film star on the Boris Karloff-hosted &quot;Thriller&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Rose&#x27;s Last Summer.&quot;

Astor starred on Broadway again in &quot;The Starcross Story&quot; (1954), another failure, and returned to southern California in 1956. She then went on a successful theatre tour of &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; directed by Agnes Moorehead and co-starring Ricardo Montalbán.

Astor&#x27;s memoir, &quot;My Story: An Autobiography&quot;, was published in 1959, becoming a sensation in its day and a bestseller. It was the result of Father Ciklic urging her to write. Though she spoke of her troubled personal life, her parents, her marriages, the scandals, her battle with alcoholism, and other areas of her life, she did not mention the movie industry or her career in detail. In 1971, a second book was published, &quot;A Life on Film&quot;, where she discussed her career. It, too, became a bestseller. Astor also tried her hand at fiction, writing the novels &quot;The Incredible Charley Carewe&quot; (1960), &quot;The Image of Kate&quot; (1962), which was published in 1964 in a German translation as &quot;Jahre und Tage&quot;, &quot;The O&#x27;Conners&quot; (1964), &quot;Goodbye, Darling, be Happy&quot; (1965), and &quot;A Place Called Saturday&quot; (1968).

Astor appeared in several movies during this time, including &quot;Stranger in My Arms&quot; (1959). She made a comeback in &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; (1961) playing Roberta Carter, the domineering mother who insists the &quot;shocking&quot; novel written by Allison Mackenzie should be banned from the school library, and received good reviews for her performance. According to film scholar Gavin Lambert, Astor invented memorable bits of business in her last scene of that film, where Roberta&#x27;s vindictive motives are exposed.

=== Final years and death ===
After a trip around the world in 1964, Astor was lured away from her Malibu, California home, where she was gardening and working on her third novel, to make what she decided would be her final film. She was offered the small role as a key figure, Jewel Mayhew, in the murder mystery &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964), starring her friend Bette Davis. She filmed her final scene with Cecil Kellaway at Oak Alley Plantation in southern Louisiana. In &quot;A Life on Film&quot;, she described her character as &quot;a little old lady, waiting to die.&quot; Astor decided it would serve as her swan song in the movie business. After 109 movies in a career spanning 45 years, she turned in her Screen Actors Guild card and retired.

Astor later moved to Fountain Valley, California, where she lived near her son, Anthony del Campo (from her third marriage to Mexican film editor Manuel del Campo), and his family, until 1971. That same year, suffering from a chronic heart condition, she moved to a small cottage on the grounds of the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House, the industry&#x27;s retirement facility in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, where she had a private table when she chose to eat in the resident dining room. She appeared in the television documentary series &quot;Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film&quot; (1980), co-produced by Kevin Brownlow, in which she discussed her roles during the silent film period. After years of retirement, she had been urged to appear in Brownlow&#x27;s documentary by a former sister-in-law Bessie Love, who also appeared in the series.

Astor died on September 25, 1987, at age 81, of respiratory failure due to pulmonary emphysema while in the hospital at the Motion Picture House complex. She is interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Astor has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6701 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Telempath is a science fiction novel by Canadian writer Spider Robinson, set in a dystopian near-future in which human cities have fallen into ruin and the population has been sharply reduced. The novel, Robinson&#x27;s first, is an expansion of his 1977 Hugo Award-winning novella &quot;By Any Other Name&quot;. It was first published under the Berkley imprint of G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons in 1976.

==Plot summary==
The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Isham Stone, is on a mission to kill the man allegedly responsible for the destruction of civilization: a scientist named Wendell Carlson, currently living alone at the former Columbia University in what used to be New York City.

Isham has been told by his father, scientist Jacob Stone, that Carlson is a madman who brought the world to its current state by releasing a &quot;hyperosmic plague&quot;: a virus that increases the sensitivity of the human sense of smell by many hundred times. With their senses of smell thus heightened, humans were unable to tolerate the odors produced by their own pollution-producing technology; the result was mass insanity and widespread rioting.

Another result was the discovery of a species of &quot;Muskys&quot; — intelligent plasmoids — that live in the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and feed on human pollutants. The curtailment of technological activity has caused them to approach the planet&#x27;s surface and attack human beings, on whose fear they are apparently able to feed.

Isham sets out for New York and succeeds in locating Carlson. He learns from Carlson, however, that the man actually responsible for developing and releasing the plague is Isham&#x27;s father Jacob. Isham returns to his home colony and sets a trap to kill his father, then returns to New York.

The original novella &quot;By Any Other Name&quot; ends at this point. The novel continues as Isham&#x27;s old teacher, Collaci, sets out to bring him back from New York to face a murder charge.

Isham is successfully captured, but before he can be tried, his colony is attacked by Agros (anti-technology worshippers of Pan) and he is taken prisoner.

Eventually Isham manages to bring about a measure of peace between the scientists and the neo-Luddites — and also learns that his father is not dead. The newly reconciled factions of humanity set out to rebuild civilization.

<text>Reinhard Bonnke (19 April 1940 - 7 December 2019) was a German-American Pentecostal evangelist, principally known for his gospel missions throughout Africa. Bonnke had been an evangelist and missionary in Africa since 1967. In Nigeria’s city, Lagos, in 2000, a single service is believed to have been attended by 1.6 million people. 

Christ For All Nations (CFAN) organisation, known for its work throughout Africa, claims Bonnke preached Christ to more than 79 million non believers.

== Early life ==
Reinhard Bonnke was born on 19th April 1940, in the city of Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany, the fifth son of Hermann Bonnke, an army logistics officer in the Reichswehr who fought on the Eastern Front; his paternal grandfather was August Bonnke, the owner of a windmill in Trunz, East Prussia (now Milejewo, Poland), who was healed of an unknown ailment by the evangelist Luis Graf in 1922, but died during the evacuation of East Prussia in 1945. His mother was Metaa Bonnke (née Scheffler). Bonnke had six siblings: Martin, Gerhard, Jurgen, Peter and Felicitas, his only younger sibling and his only sister. 

With his mother and siblings, he was taken to Denmark during the evacuation of East Prussia and spent some years in a displaced persons centre before settling in Gluckstadt, West Germany. After his own war service, his father became a pastor in the village of Krempe. 
He became a born-again Christian at the age of nine after his mother spoke with him about a sin that he had committed. He sensed a call from God to serve as a missionary in Africa from the age of 10 and said that he had the experience of baptism in the Holy Spirit. 

Bonnke studied at the Bible College of Wales in Swansea, Wales, UK, where he was inspired by the director, Samuel Rees Howells. In one meeting Howells spoke of answered prayer; after this meeting, Bonnke prayed, &quot;Lord, I also want to be a man of faith. I want to see your way of providing for needs.&quot; Passing through London, he had a chance meeting with the preacher George Jeffreys. As he walked, he came across a house with a nameplate on the front that said “George Jeffreys”. He wondered if it could be the great George Jeffreys who had founded the Elim Pentecostal churches in Ireland and England. He prayed for the young student and imparted grace to him.

Aftergraduation, he pastored in Germany for seven years, including establishing a congregation in Flensburg which met in a former rum factory.

==African mission==
His work in Africa began in 1967. He arrived in South Africa and almost immediately encountered the apartheid system, which he developed an antipathy towards, which in turn caused friction between him and the minister who oversaw him in South Africa. Bonnke subsequently accepted a position to oversee three churches in Lesotho, but began again from scratch after he discovered that unbiblical practices had emerged in the congregations he was to oversee.

In the first few years of his work, Bonnke encountered poor results from his evangelistic efforts and felt frustrated at the pace of his ministry. Then he had a recurring dream featuring a picture of the map of Africa being splattered with blood and heard the voice of God crying &quot;Africa Shall Be Saved&quot;. This ultimately led him to adopt large-scale evangelism, rather than the traditional small-scale missionary approach. He rented a stadium in Gaborone, Botswana, and preached with little cooperation from local churches. The first meetings saw about 100 people attending, but this number grew swiftly.

In 1974, Bonnke founded the mission organisation Christ for all Nations (CfaN). Originally based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the headquarters were relocated to Frankfurt, Germany, in 1986. This was done primarily to distance the organisation from South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policy at the time. Today CfaN has 9 offices across 5 continents.

Bonnke began his ministry holding tent meetings that accommodated large crowds. According to an account published by the Christian Broadcasting Network, in 1984 he commissioned the construction of what was claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest mobile structure - a tent capable of seating 34,000; this was destroyed in a wind storm just before a major meeting and therefore the team decided to hold the event in the open air instead. According to this account, the event was subsequently attended by over 100,000 people which is far greater than the 34,000 seating capacity the tents could have contained. For various reasons, usually due to insufficient capacity, the 34,000-seat tent was only used once, in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1986.

In addition to South Africa, Bonnke would also hold many campaigns in other African countries including Nigeria and Kenya and became known as &quot;the Billy Graham of Africa.&quot; In the 5 February 2001 edition of Graham&#x27;s &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, journalist Corrie Cutrer stated that Bonnke had set &quot;record-breaking attendances&quot; at recent events he held in Nigeria. Bonnke announced his &quot;farewell gospel crusade&quot; to be held in Lagos, Nigeria, in November 2017. Lagos is also the location of a gospel crusade held in 2000 which, according to CfaN, is the organization&#x27;s largest to date, drawing an attendance of six million people. In 2009 Bonnke appointed his successor, Daniel Kolenda who continues to lead the ministry. In 2020, following Bonnke&#x27;s death, Christ for all Nations launched the CfaN Evangelism Bootcamp. In 2022 Schools of Evangelism were started in South Africa, and Europe and Fire Camps were launched in dozens of nations on six continents. Today, more than 4,000 evangelists have been trained by Christ for all Nations and more than 91-million decisions for Christ have been counted. In 2024, in the 50th year of the ministry, CfaN is conducting 50 gospel crusades throughout the African contenent.

==Persecution==
=== Kano riots, subsequent expulsion from Nigeria, and return to the country ===
In 1991, during Bonnke&#x27;s visit to Kano in Nigeria, there were riots in the city as Muslims protested over remarks he had reportedly made about Islam in the city of Kaduna on his way to Kano. A rumour was spread that Bonnke was planning to &quot;lead an invasion&quot; into Kano. Muslim youths gathered at the Kofar Mata Eide-ground where they were addressed by several clerics who claimed that Bonnke was going to blaspheme Islam. About 8,000 youths gathered at the Emir&#x27;s palace and after noon prayers the riots ensued, during which many Christians sustained various injuries and several churches were burned. Official reports state that at least eight people were killed, although other research and reports place the number as being as much as 500 as many of the Christians who were killed were thrown into wells and the attacks were spread between multiple locations.

Despite the state governor absolving Bonnke of any blame for the incident, Bonnke&#x27;s subsequent attempts to return to Nigeria were denied, as the Nigerian Embassy refused his visa applications. In 2000, a new civilian government in Nigeria was elected to power, and President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian, invited Reinhard Bonnke to return to the country. Bonnke returned to Nigeria and held a crusades in Benin City in the south. He would deny reports that the Northern Region of Nigeria&#x27;s Council of Ulamas banned him from entering northern Nigeria.

Bonnke held many crusades in Nigeria after 2000, and conversion rates were significantly higher than in many other African nations, with one campaign achieving an 83% conversion rate. Nigeria would be where his final international crusade would be held, in Lagos in 2017.

== Personal life ==
After graduating from the Bible College of Wales and returning to Germany, Bonnke led a series of meetings in Rendsburg. He began receiving speaking invitations from all around Germany and the rest of the world. Bonnke met Anni Suelze at a gospel music festival and admired the grace which she showed when a mistake led to her losing a music competition. He offered to preach at the church she attended and over time they fell in love. They married in 1964 and had three children: Kai-Uwe Friedrich, known as &quot;Freddy&quot;, Gabrielle and Suzanne. 

== Death ==
Bonnke died on 7 December 2019. The month before, he had announced on his official Facebook page that he had undergone femur surgery and needed time to &quot;learn how to walk again&quot;. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who is Muslim, praised Bonnke for his frequent visits to Nigeria and described his death as a &quot;great loss to Nigeria&quot;.

His appointed successor is the evangelist Daniel Kolenda.

<text>In generative grammar, a parasitic gap is a construction in which one gap appears to be dependent on another gap. Thus, the one gap can appear only by virtue of the appearance of the other gap, hence the former is said to be &quot;parasitic&quot; on the latter. For example, in the example sentence in (1) the first gap is represented by an underscore ( __ ), and appears as a result of movement of the constituent which explanation to the beginning of the sentence. The second gap is represented by an underscore with a subscript p ( __p); this is the &quot;parasitic gap&quot;.

While parasitic gaps are present in English and some related Germanic languages, e.g. Swedish (see Engdahl 1983), their appearance is much more restricted in other, closely related languages, e.g. German and the Romance languages. Japanese linguistic scholar Fumikazu Niinuma has attempted to differentiate between parasitic gaps and coordination in his research, as he believes the two are often confused.

An aspect of parasitic gaps that makes them particularly mysterious is the fact they usually appear inside islands to extraction. Although the study of parasitic gaps began in the late 1970s, no consensus has yet been reached about the best analysis.

==The phenomenon==

The example sentences in (2) are normal declarative sentences that contain no gap at all. The sentences in (3), in contrast, contain two gaps, whereby the second gap is parasitic on the first; the parasitic gap is marked with a p-subscript. The sentences in (4) show that if there is no real gap (that corresponds to the bold-faced constituent), then the parasitic gap is not possible. 
:
The appearance of parasitic gaps in (3) appears to be reliant on syntactic movement (e.g. wh-movement or topicalization), and presents two challenges:

* The fact that there are two gaps but only one fronted wh-expression is a source of difficulty for the analysis of parasitic gap constructions. Why can one fronted wh-expression license two gaps?
* The fact that parasitic gaps usually appear inside extraction islands leads one to expect extraction from the site of the parasitic gap to be altogether impossible. Why do parasitic gaps ignore islands?.

==History==

=== Discovery ===
The phenomenon of parasitic gaps appears to have been discovered by John Robert Ross in the 1960s, but remained undiscussed until papers by Knut Tarald Taraldsen and Elisabet Engdahl explored the properties of the phenomenon in detail. The analysis of parasitic gaps was central to the development of the GPSG framework (Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar) in the mid 1980s, and this analysis was later refined in the HPSG framework (Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar) of Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag. In the 1990s, a debate centered around the best theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps, namely extraction versus percolation. This debate culminated in a collection of essays edited by Peter Culicover and Paul Postal in 2001.

===Controversy===

==== Extraction gap versus proform ====
The theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps is not a settled matter by any means, since accounts of the phenomenon vary drastically. In very broad terms, there are two lines of analysis that one can pursue:

* The extraction analysis assumes that parasitic gaps are extraction gaps, and that parasitic gaps arise by way of the same basic mechanism that licenses &quot;normal&quot; extraction gaps. This sort of approach must augment the analysis of extraction gaps in some way in order to accommodate parasitic gaps under the same theoretical umbrella. Extraction analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that most parasitic gaps appear to be dependent on the occurrence of wh-movement or topicalization. Extraction analyses are challenged, however, by missing-object constructions, as noted above.
* The proform analysis assumes that parasitic gaps actually contain a covert element, this element having the status of definite proform. Proform analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that many parasitic gaps occur optionally; the covert proform has the option to be overt. Proform analyses are challenged, however, by the fact that most parasitic gaps occur in the immediate environment of wh-movement or topicalization, since they do not provide a clear basis for explaining this correlation.

Some analyses mix and match these two basic lines of analysis, although in general, both are well represented in the literature on parasitism and most accounts can be placed in the one or the other camp.

==== Licensing of real gap ====
The controversy regarding the licensing of parasitic gaps has also been widely debated as the phenomenon has continued to be researched. It is generally agreed upon that a real gap licenses a parasitic gap however, the required properties of this real gap have been widely debated. In 1994, Postal wrote a paper examining how the leftward extraction of clauses may be a general licensor for parasitic gaps while examining two theoretical approaches:

* P-Gap Licensing Restriction (PLR) suggests that the gaps that license parasitic gaps must be restricted in some way. 
* PG=NP suggests that the licensors of parasitic gaps must be NPs/DPs.

On the basis of evidence from topicalization and object raising, Postal&#x27;s 1994 paper concludes that true parasitic gaps are not licensed by rightward DP movement, but rather by leftward extraction of a clause. Overfelt 2016 argues against Postal&#x27;s claim that rightward DP movement cannot license true parasitic gaps, and concludes that the licensors of true parasitic gaps are adjunction structures.

==Some traits of parasitic gaps==

Some of the central research issues that arise in the investigation of parasitic gaps include:
*optionality: many parasitic gaps are optional
*obligatoriness: some parasitic gaps are obligatory
*missing object: the appearance of parasitic gaps in missing object constructions (also known as &quot;tough&quot;-movement)
*parallelism: syntactic parallelism seems to promote the appearance of parasitic gaps

===Often optional===

Many parasitic gaps appear optionally. They are in non-complementary distribution with a pronoun, meaning that the speaker has the choice whether to employ the gap or not. The example sentences in (5) contain typical parasitic gaps, whereas the ones in (6) use a pronoun instead of the gap. In other words, in these contexts, the parasitic gap is optional. Optionality like this suggests an analysis of parasitism in terms of ellipsis, since optionality is the primary trait of known ellipsis mechanisms.
:

===Sometimes obligatory===
While many parasitic gaps occur optionally, other parasitic gaps occur obligatorily; this can be seen when the parasitic gap precedes the &quot;real&quot; gap. The example sentences in (7) are normal declarative sentences that contain no gap at all. The sentences in (8), in contrast, contain two gaps, with the parasitic gap preceding the real gap. We know that the first gap (the leftmost gap) in (8) is parasitic on the following gap because it, i.e. the leftmost gap, appears inside what is normally an extraction island (marked with square brackets). As for the sentences in (9) — which are strongly marginal (indicated by the double question mark notation ??) — they show that in a sense, the real gap can also be dependent on the parasitic gap. This aspect of parasitic gaps is related to weak crossover (WCO). WCO occurs when a fronted expression is coreferential with an intermediate expression that appears between the fronted expression and the position of its gap.
:
In the big picture, one can simply note that parasitic gaps behave variably depending upon whether they precede or follow the &quot;real&quot; gap. When they precede the &quot;real&quot; gap, their appearance is usually obligatory.

===Missing object===
Much work on parasitism assumes that parasitic gaps are dependent on the existence of another gap. The assumption is that parasitic gaps are reliant on the mechanisms that license normal extraction gaps such as wh-movement and topicalization. This assumption is challenged, however, by so-called missing-object constructions, also known as &quot;tough&quot;-constructions or &quot;tough&quot;-movement. The example sentences in (10) lack gaps entirely. The sentences in (11) contain parasitic gaps despite the fact that neither wh-movement nor topicalization has occurred. These sentences illustrate a missing-object construction, since the verbs &quot;appreciate&quot;, &quot;understand&quot;, and &quot;get&quot; are transitive and should hence take an object. This object is missing, as marked by the gap on the left. Whatever the analysis of parasitic gaps ends up being in the long run, it will have to accommodate the facts involving missing objects illustrated here. Movement (wh-movement, topicalization) may not actually be the key factor licensing parasitic gaps.
:

===Show structural parallelism===

Examining the examples of optional parasitic gaps produced above so far, one sees that in each case, a certain structural parallelism is present, where both the real gap and the parasitic gap bear the grammatical function of direct object. This parallelism is now explicitly illustrated using brackets. In each of these examples, the square brackets mark what appear to be parallel structures, similar to the type of coordinate structure found coordination. The brackets mark verb phrases (VPs), and the subordinator appearing between the brackets is functioning like a coordinator (i.e. &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, or &quot;but&quot;). This parallelism may be a significant factor that is aiding the appearance of the parasitic gaps.

When the real gap and the parasitic gap are not structurally parallel — as when the real gap bears the grammatical function of subject, while the parasitic gap bears the grammatical function of object — there is a significant drop in acceptability of the parasitic gap. The examples in (13) show that, in such contexts, parasitic gaps are all marginal to varying degrees.

The marginality of the examples in (13) correlates with the lack of syntactic parallelism. What exactly explains this drop in acceptability is not entirely clear, although it may have to do with ease of processing. Parallel structures are easier for humans to process, and hence parasitic gaps are facilitated by contexts that have a low processing load.

<text>John C. Turmel (born February 22, 1951) is a perennial candidate for election in Canada, and according to the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; holds the records for the most elections contested and for the most elections lost, having contested 112 elections and lost 111. The other contest was a by-election that was pre-empted by a general election call.

==Background==
Turmel, who describes himself as a &quot;Libertarian Socred&quot;, believes in Louis Even&#x27;s Quebec social credit theory of monetary reform and has also campaigned for the legalization of gambling, the adoption of &quot;Local Employment Trading Systems&quot; (LETS) which are interest-free barter arrangements, and for the legalization of marijuana. He describes his platform as &quot;I want no cops in gambling, sex or drugs or rock and roll, I want no usury on loans, pay cash or time, no dole.&quot;

He has participated in several protests outside of Canada&#x27;s major banking institutions, saying that bank interest promotes poverty and starvation in the third world.

Turmel, an electrical engineering graduate, who lists his occupation as &quot;professional gambler&quot; was active in the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Social Credit Party of Ontario in the 1980s, and founded the Christian Credit Party in the 1980s, the Abolitionist Party of Canada in the 1990s, and the Pauper Party of Ontario in 2011.
He wears a white construction helmet, when campaigning,
and calls himself &quot;The Engineer&quot;.
The colour of his helmet is said to not only refer to the white construction helmets worn by engineers and architects on construction sites, but also to the &quot;berets blanc&quot; (white berets), the nickname of the Pilgrims of Saint Michael, a radical monetarist faction within the Quebec social credit movement.

Turmel&#x27;s grandfather, Adelard Turmel, supported the Social Credit Party of Canada from its inception in 1935, and he passed on a belief in social credit monetary theories to his descendants. His brother, Raymond Turmel, has also campaigned for public office on several occasions.

Turmel spent most of his life in Ottawa but has made Brantford, Ontario, his home since 2003 after running in a by-election there and finding he liked the area where he could play high-stakes Holdem Poker professionally at the Brantford Charity Casino.

==Political activity==
===Gambling activism===
Turmel received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Carleton University in Ottawa in 1976 with a specialization in the mathematics of gambling and became Teaching Assistant to Walter Schneider in the course until 1978 when he was fired for running a highly publicized Blackjack &quot;21&quot; game in the Faculty Club. The next year he received his first conviction for keeping a common gaming house for running Blackjack games at home. In 1981, Turmel was convicted and jailed for 21 days for keeping a gaming house and playing 21, he lost the appeal but had the sentence converted to 100 hours community service playing accordion in old-age homes. In 1991, Turmel was convicted in Gatineau, Quebec, of running a common gaming house and sentenced to 4 months in jail. Before getting out after one month, Turmel ran for Chair of Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality while in jail, collecting approximately 3,500 votes. In 1993, as a part of Project Robin Hood, Ottawa and Ontario Provincial Police raided the private 28-table Casino Turmel, the largest gaming house raid in Canadian history. Turmel was convicted and sentenced to 200 hours community service playing accordion in retirement homes.

===Entering the electoral fray===
His campaign to legalize gambling and the notoriety he received as a result, combined with his family&#x27;s background in social credit ideology, led Turmel to seek election at the federal level for the first time at the age of 28, as an independent candidate in Ottawa West in the May 1979 federal election in which he ran as the self-described &quot;champion of hookers, gamblers and dope smokers&quot; in a campaign in which he argued interest on money, usury, was the evil instability in financial affairs and swore to &quot;abolish interest rates&quot;. He won 193 votes.

===Social Credit===
He ran again as an independent in the February 1980 federal election in Ottawa Centre. His application to run as a Social Credit Party of Canada candidate was rejected by party leader Fabien Roy. He won 64 votes. The Social Credit Party lost its remaining seats in the election.

Because of the death of the Social Credit candidate in Frontenac riding in Quebec during the election, a by-election was held in March. When Fabien Roy accepted the nomination without a convention, Turmel ran again as an independent against the Social Credit candidate. He ran as an independent candidate in the April 13 federal by-election in London West, claiming to be interim leader of the Ontario Social Credit Party. Turmel won 77 votes as an &quot;independent Social Credit&quot; candidate in a September 8 by-election in Hamilton West.

He also sought the Social Credit Party of Canada’s interim national leadership unsuccessfully at a convention in November in Calgary. Turmel opposed the appointment of Martin Hattersley as interim leader of the federal Social Credit party as being undemocratic. The party executive claimed that the party did not have sufficient funds to hold a convention.

While running in the Hamilton West federal byelection, Turmel registered for Mayor of Ottawa in November, collecting 1,928 votes. At the same time, he ran as the Social Credit candidate in a provincial by-election in Carleton riding, coming in last. Registered in a hat-trick.

With grandfather Adelard, mother Therese, and brother Ray Turmel in support, Turmel started picketing the Bank of Canada on every Thursday when the interest rate was set and then picketing Parliament too. This continued for five years until the retirement of Governor Gerald Bouey.

In the March 1981 provincial election, Turmel ran as a Social Credit candidate in Ottawa Centre, while his brother Raymond ran for the party in Ottawa South and Serge Girard, Dale Alkerton and Andrew Dynowski ran in neighbouring ridings. It was reported that he became interim leader of the Ontario Social Credit Party in early March, although it is not clear if other members of the party agreed.

In September, Turmel was a candidate in the federal by-election in Spadina riding in Toronto, collecting 98 votes. The national Social Credit party president Carl O’Malley refused to endorse a candidate on the basis that the Liberal candidate, Jim Coutts, a former adviser to Pierre Trudeau, was a personal friend. Raymond Turmel ran as an independent against O’Malley in the by-election held in Joliette, Quebec on the same day, claiming to be the &quot;real Social Credit&quot; candidate.

In October, the Ontario Social Credit Party conducted a leadership vote. The eleven delegates, who represented about 100 party members throughout the province, elected former Toronto mayoral candidate Anne McBride as their new interim leader in a vote of 7 to 1 with 3 spoiled ballots. One vote was cast for Bruce Arnold. Turmel, his brother Ray and their mother, Therese, wrote the word &quot;unconstitutional&quot; across the ballots. Turmel argued that the party was violating its constitution by holding a vote without providing four months&#x27; notice to its members. McBride was a Christian fundamentalist minister who vowed to run the party &quot;on Christian principles&quot;.

In September, Turmel was reported to be fighting his expulsion from the federal Social Credit Party, and seeking its leadership. Further, he was reported to be seeking to replace Joe Clark as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Turmel denied the report, but the journalist stood by her story.

===Christian Credit Party===
In June 1982, Turmel returned to Hamilton West to run in a provincial by-election as a candidate of the Christian Credit Party that he had recently founded. He won 173 votes.

The Christian Credit Party was formed after the Social Credit Party refused to renew the memberships of Turmel and his brother Raymond. The Turmel brothers said that they left the party because it had compromised its principles on interest rates.

He also ran for the Christian Credit Party in the September federal by-election in Broadview—Greenwood (in Toronto), winning an all-time low 16 votes. Raymond ran for the party in Leeds—Grenville in eastern Ontario.

In July, Turmel attempted to recruit members for his new party at the Social Credit national convention in Regina. In September, the party claimed to have 75 members.

In November 1982, Turmel ran for alderman in the Ottawa suburb of Gloucester, and appears to have abandoned an attempt to run in a provincial by-election in Toronto-York South though list #13 shows it was not abandoned. His brother, Raymond, ran for mayor of Gloucester, while their colleague Marc Gauvin ran for mayor of Ottawa.

By 1983, the Christian Credit Party appears to have died. Turmel said he disbanded his party because he realized voters would not give it a chance. &quot;People won&#x27;t vote for a new party. They&#x27;ve been voting for one colour all their lives. The only way to do anything is to get into a recognized party.&quot;

Turmel, with Therese and Ray, Marc and Emi Gauvin and Serge Girard picketed the 1983 Bilderberger conference held at Chateau Montebello.

Turmel ran as an independent candidate in the Central Nova (Nova Scotia) riding by-election in September 1983 against Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney. He claimed to be a &quot;member of the Abolitionist wing of the PC party&quot;.

Turmel won 97 votes as a candidate in a provincial by-election in Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, Ontario.

===Green Party===
In the months before the 1984 federal election, Turmel attempted to take over the Ottawa branch of the fledgling Green Party of Canada by signing up new members and seeking the party’s nomination in Ottawa Centre. After the party had appointed a candidate in Ottawa Centre rather than hold nominations, Turmel claimed that it was undemocratic and called a meeting at which all Greens were invited to elect candidates to run in various Ottawa area ridings under the Green Party banner. The party rejected those nominations, and then held its own meeting to nominate new candidates.

In the election, Turmel ran as an independent against Green Party leader Trevor Hancock in Toronto—Beaches, Marc Gauvin ran in Ottawa Centre, supporter Serge Girard in Ottawa—Vanier, and John and Ray’s mother, Therese Turmel ran in Ottawa West, and Ray Turmel ran as an &quot;independent Green&quot; in Nepean—Carleton.

Turmel ran as an independent candidate in the December 13, 1984, provincial by-election in Ottawa Centre, and Serge Girard ran in Ottawa East. Turmel also ran for mayor of Ottawa.

In 1985, the Executive of the Ontario Branch of the Green Party expelled Ontario member John Turmel and Quebec member Ray Turmel.

===Mid to late 1980s===
Also in 1985, Turmel appears to have founded the &quot;Social Credit Party of Ontario&quot;, which was not affiliated with other social credit parties. Turmel led a campaign against the practice of cheque cashing agencies that cashed social assistance (SA, or welfare) cheques at a discount to the face value. Turmel issued ID card to SA recipients and recruited local retailers to cash the cheques at no discount. The Social Credit Party of Ontario guaranteed these cheques. In November, Turmel supporter Walter McPhee ran for Ottawa mayor and Turmel for Nepean mayor. This proved to be Turmel&#x27;s best performance by percentage of the vote, as he collected 7.25% of the vote, as he was the only other candidate against mayor Ben Franklin. Turmel ran in an April 1986 provincial by-election in Toronto-York East and an August 14 provincial by-election in Cochrane, Ontario, apparently under the &quot;Social Credit Party of Ontario&quot; banner.

In September, he ran as an &quot;independent créditiste&quot; claiming to be the heir of Réal Caouette in a federal by-election in St.-Maurice, Quebec when Liberal MP Jean Chrétien resigned.

In June 1987, Turmel ran in a federal by-election in Hamilton Mountain. He was reported to be &quot;attempting to form&quot; an Ontario Social Credit Party.

In the autumn of 1988, Turmel ran for mayor of Ottawa, Member of Parliament for Ottawa Centre and Member of Provincial Parliament for Welland—Thorold in the Niagara peninsula in a November 3 provincial by-election.

===Abolitionist Party===
Turmel founded the Abolitionist Party of Canada, which nominated 80 candidates in the 1993 federal election, one more than the Green Party of Canada.

In 1994, Turmel won over 4,500 votes running for Chair of Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality, the largest number of votes in his career.

He won 46 votes as the Abolitionist Party candidate in the February 13, 1995, Ottawa—Vanier federal by-election.

In June 1996, Turmel ran under the Abolitionist Party banner in a Hamilton East federal by-election and lost.

Turmel won 4,126 votes (2.5% of the total) running for Chair of Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality in 1997, in which Bob Chiarelli defeated Peter Clark by 2,798 votes. Turmel won 214 votes as an independent candidate in Ottawa West—Nepean in the 1997 federal election. In September, Turmel won 201 votes as an independent candidate in Ottawa West in a provincial by-election.

Turmel ran for the board of the National Capital FreeNet after the previous board reduced the number of seats from 7 to 5. He came 6th, and argues he was cheated out of the only election he ever won.

Turmel appeared in the 1997 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for most elections contested.

He ran as an &quot;independent Abolitionist&quot; in a September 14, 1998, federal by-election in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

In 1999, he won 106 votes as an Abolitionist Party candidate in a March federal by-election in Windsor—St. Clair, Ontario, which was more than the margin by which Liberal candidate Rick Limoges defeated Joe Comartin of the New Democratic Party.

===Early 2000s===
In 2000, Turmel ran as an independent candidate in the September Kings—Hants (Nova Scotia) federal by-election against Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark. He won 89 votes as an independent candidate in Ottawa West—Nepean in the November federal election.

In the same year, he made a presentation to the United Nations on the interest-free UNILETS resulting in Millennium Declaration Resolution C6 to governments to use an alternative time-based currency to restructure the global financial architecture.

In 2002, Turmel attempted to run for the leadership of the Marijuana Party but the leadership election was called off after Turmel showed up to contest the election.

Turmel won 295 votes as an independent candidate in Brant riding in the 2003 October provincial election. His 56th campaign was for Mayor of Ottawa in the November 2003 municipal election, when he collected 1,166 votes.

He also tried to resurrect the Libertarian Party of Canada, but was prevented from doing so when former members re-registered the name first.

Turmel ran as an independent candidate and placed fifth with 120 votes in a May 13, 2004, provincial by-election in Hamilton East. He placed last of eight candidates as an independent candidate in the March 17, 2005, provincial by-election in Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey and placed last in Brant riding with 213 votes in the 2006 federal election.

Turmel was convicted of drug possession in March 2006, resulting from a one-man protest on Parliament Hill in Ottawa three years earlier. Turmel had taken three kilograms of marijuana to the hill, and openly smoked a joint in front of politicians and security officials. He announced plans to appeal. The conviction was rendered on the same day as a provincial by-election in Nepean—Carleton, in which Turmel was a candidate.

In 2003, Turmel acted as a party to Hitzig v Canada, a civil suit instrumental in reforming the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations and the status of medical cannabis in Canada generally.

Turmel ran as an independent candidate in a 2008 by-election in the riding of Guelph. On Monday, August 25, he disrupted a televised debate involving candidates from the four major political parties to which the other four candidates had not been invited to participate. He yelled out his objections so loudly that the moderator of the debate could not be heard. He was eventually removed from the venue, the River Run Centre, by the Guelph police. The by-election was pre-empted by a federal election call in which Turmel re-filed his candidacy for the same riding – he came in tenth out of eleven candidates receiving 58 votes.

On September 10, 2009, police were called after Turmel lost control and disrupted an all-candidates meeting during the provincial by-election in Ontario&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s riding. Angry at a moderator&#x27;s rule which forced residents to direct their questions at four of eight candidates, thus effectively limiting his opportunity to speak, Turmel lashed out and ran around the church hall shouting at debate panelists and audience members that he&#x27;d go back onstage when he could answer too. At one point, the debate had to pause as a group of attendees attempted a citizen&#x27;s arrest. Turmel stated that he would &quot;ruin everyone&#x27;s night&quot; because &quot;mine was ruined&quot;.

===&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Den&quot;===
On January 13, 2010, Turmel appeared on the CBC television show &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; pitching his Local exchange trading system scheme, asking the panel of entrepreneurs to invest $100,000 for a program which would use poker chips from a local casino as currency at local businesses in Brantford, Ontario. The &quot;dragons&quot; said they didn’t understand Turmel&#x27;s presentation and mocked him. Kevin O&#x27;Leary told Turmel he should &quot;burst into flames&quot; and fellow dragon Jim Treliving told Turmel he was &quot;blowing air up a dead horse&#x27;s ass&quot;. Turmel initiated a lawsuit against the CBC as a result of the program. His complaint was rejected by the Ontario Court of Appeal in July 2011. On December 8, 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada denied Turmel&#x27;s subsequent request for leave to appeal. He continues to maintain that the show was a &quot;smear job&quot;.

===2011 federal election===
After contesting every Canadian general election from 1979 to 2008, Turmel did not contest the 2011 federal election. He indicated, however, that he would be willing to serve as prime minister if offered the role by Canada&#x27;s elected parliamentarians, as per William Aberhart&#x27;s rise to the premiership of Alberta in 1935 if the Engineer&#x27;s Dream Team of chosen other party candidates were elected.

===Pauper Party===
Turmel contested the 2011 Ontario provincial election as founder and leader of the newly formed Pauper Party of Ontario. stating &quot;we want no cops in gambling, sex or drugs or rock and roll, we want no usury on loans, pay cash or time, no dole.&quot; Turmel has subsequently run in Ontario by-elections under the &quot;Pauper&quot; banner.

===Recent by-elections===
In 2012, Turmel again ran as an independent, this time in the March 19 federal by-election in Toronto—Danforth to choose a successor to Jack Layton. He ran on a campaign pushing for mass production of marijuana to fight cancers he says are coming from the &quot;nuclear fallout that hit us from Fukushima&quot;.

On the provincial level, Turmel has continued to carry the banner of the Pauper Party of Ontario and ran in the August 1, 2013 by-election in Ottawa South to choose the successor to Dalton McGuinty placing last with 43 votes. He ran again as a Pauper candidate in the February 13, 2014 provincial by-election in Thornhill placing last with 49 votes. On September 1, 2016, he secured second-to-last place in the Scarborough—Rouge River provincial by-election by one vote over former Trillium Party candidate Ania Krosinska.

Turmel placed sixth out of six candidates in the 2020 York Centre federal by-election, earning just under 0.6% of the vote.

In 2023, he was a candidate in the Hamilton Centre provincial by-election, the Oxford federal by-election, the Scarborough—Guildwood provincial by-election, and the Kitchener Centre provincial by-election.

In 2024, he contested the Milton provincial by-election, the LaSalle—Émard—Verdun federal by-election, and the Bay of Quinte provincial by-election.

==Vexatious litigation==
According to the Attorney General of Canada, Turmel is a &quot;perennial litigant&quot; and has filed at least 67 court proceedings since 1980. In 2022, Canada&#x27;s Federal Court labelled Turmel a &quot;vexatious litigant&quot;, which prevents him from introducing a new application to the Court unless he had a court order to allow it.

==Appearance before Parliament==

On June 6, 2018, Turmel appeared as a witness before the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the Trudeau Government&#x27;s proposed changes to the Canada Elections Act.
During his appearance Turmel argued for free and equal broadcasting time for all candidates and fair auditing rules for candidates with only minor campaign expenses.
He also discussed the time banking software &quot;LETS&quot;, being arrested, and being invited to give speeches at the United Nations.

<text>The Garrison Library was founded in Gibraltar in 1793 by Captain (later Colonel) John Drinkwater Bethune.

==History==
Constructed on the site of the Governors’ residence during the Spanish occupation of Gibraltar, the library was officially opened in 1804 by the Duke of Kent. In 1823 the library&#x27;s fees were &quot;100 hard dollars&quot; which was paid by the 150 proprietors of the &quot;Commercial Library&quot;. Each proprietor was entitled to borrow one large or three smaller books or an entire set of a novel for one to two weeks. In exchange they had to also pay 16 dollars per year. This was a commercial affair and membership of the library could be bought or sold. The thirteen members of the committee were elected annually and the library was to be open seven days a week with both winter and summer hours.

The library served as the headquarters and archive service of the &quot;Gibraltar Chronicle&quot;, the world&#x27;s second oldest English language newspaper. The Library was established for and by the officers of the Garrison of Gibraltar. It has remained a private entity run by a Trust for over two hundred years up until, September 2011, at which point the Library was transferred to the Government of Gibraltar.

==Description==
The Garrison is a library of 45,000 books, including many rare volumes. This library exists to hold the collection which includes good coverage of the subjects of culture and travel. The library was started to occupy officers stationed in Gibraltar. It has an excellent local history collection. Many lithographs and art prints are held here and many of the furnishings have interesting historical backgrounds.

In 2006 the editorial offices of the &quot;Gibraltar Chronicle&quot; moved to new premises in &quot;Watergate House&quot;, and the print works relocated in 2007 to &quot;New Harbours&quot;. The Chronicle&#x27;s archive currently remains at the Garrison Library, as does the records of the more recent Panorama newspaper.

The dragon tree in the library&#x27;s front garden is thought to date from the Spanish occupation when the plant was introduced to Gibraltar by mariners who brought the seeds from the Canary Islands.

<text>Štore () is a town in eastern Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Štore. It lies on the Voglajna River, just east of Celje. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. The municipality is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region.

==Name==
The name &quot;Štore&quot; is probably originally an accusative plural derived from the Slovene common noun &quot;štor&quot; &#x27;stump&#x27;, referring to an area where stumps remained after it was cleared.

==History==
Until the Second World War, Štore was a hamlet of the village of Kresnike (today Kresnike is a hamlet of Štore). The town only developed in the mid-19th century, when the ironworks were established in the area after coal was found in the surrounding hills.

<doc id="564332" wikidata="Q1935888" url="?curid=564332" title="San Juan Island">
<text>San Juan Island is the second-largest and most populous of the San Juan Islands in northwestern Washington, United States. It has a land area of 142.59 km2 (55.053 sq mi) and a population of 8,632 as of the 2020 census.

Washington State Ferries serves Friday Harbor, which is San Juan Island&#x27;s major population center, the San Juan County seat, and the only incorporated town in the islands.

== History ==
The name &quot;San Juan&quot; originates from the 1791 expedition of Francisco de Eliza, who named the archipelago &quot;Isla y Archipiélago de San Juan&quot; to honor his patron sponsor, Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo. One of the officers under Eliza&#x27;s command, Gonzalo López de Haro, was the first European to discover San Juan Island. During the Wilkes Expedition, American explorer Charles Wilkes renamed the island &quot;Rodgers Island&quot;; the Spanish name remained on British nautical charts and over time became the island&#x27;s official name.

The island saw seasonal use for salmon fishing. The island was also occupied by Native Americans, many of whom arrived seasonally for fishing. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) established the first permanent, non-native settlement on the island on December 13, 1853, in order to create a sheep farm. The Belle Vue Sheep Farm, set up by Chief Factor and Governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island, James Douglas, was intended to assert British sovereignty over the disputed San Juan Islands.

Both the British and Americans asserted control of the island. A small force of American soldiers was sent to the island over concern for this issue and with Native American raids on American settlers. The territorial dispute over this island and the rest of the San Juan Islands heightened when an American settler shot an HBC pig, starting the Pig War in 1859. By November 1859, an agreement was reached for a joint British–American control of the island until the matter was resolved by negotiation. In 1861, the HBC decided to give up the sheep farm due to disruption of HBC sheep by Americans, the subsequent demoralization of HBC employees, and lack of British government support. In 1862, Chief Trader Charles John Griffin left the island and leased the Belle Vue Sheep Farm to Robert Firth, a shepherd, from 1864 to 1873.

The dispute was finally resolved in favor of the Americans in 1872.

The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic swept through the region, killing large numbers of indigenous people. Smallpox Bay, on the west side of San Juan Island, was named for victims of this epidemic.

==Island life==


San Juan Island is considered a &quot;small town&quot; community, in that it is relatively quiet rural living with few distractions or incidents aside from tourism. One notable resident would be Lisa &quot;Ivory&quot; Moretti, a retired female professional wrestler of World Wrestling Entertainment fame. In addition, many Hollywood stars and celebrities spend time on the island to avoid publicity and to seek some peace and quiet.

===Historical sites===
A pair of landmarks, the old English and American Camps, are at opposite ends of the island, which together comprise the San Juan Island National Historical Park, which commemorates the 1859 Pig War. Interpretive centers and reconstructed buildings, formal gardens, etc. recall the history of early European settlement in the area.

===Infrastructure===

The Island has a hospital, the Peace Health Peace Island Medical Center.

Transportation to the Island is by boat, Washington State Ferries, seaplane, or by conventional aircraft. If traveling by seaplane, Friday Harbor is serviced by Northwest Seaplanes and Kenmore Air, both longtime operators in the area. The Friday Harbor Airport terminal is 1.3 miles from the Ferry Landing. Outside of Friday Harbor, the only major commercial establishment resort is the village of Roche Harbor, located on the northwest side of the island.

===Media===
San Juan Island has a number of weekly newspapers and two online daily news sites: the San Juan Islander and the Island Guardian.

===Tourism===
The Island is dotted with numerous farms, and is a tourist-driven economy. The island hosts two substantial marinas, one in Friday Harbor, the other in Roche Harbor. Both count tall ships and large yachts as frequent visitors.

It has several attractions including The Whale Museum; a contemporary Art Museum building completed in 2015; the San Juan Community Theatre; the Sculpture Park (near Roche Harbor); the San Juan Historical Museum; and Lime Kiln Point State Park where visitors can watch orca pods swim by.

==Schools==
Public schools are operated by the San Juan Island School District #149. It operates four schools: Friday Harbor Elementary School, Friday Harbor Middle School, Friday Harbor High School, Griffin Bay Schools (alternative high school, parent-partner home school program, online courses, and virtual school), and Stuart Island School (K-8). There are also two privately operated schools.

The University of Washington runs Friday Harbor Laboratories, a marine research lab and campus outside Friday Harbor. The campus has been extant since 1909 and has dormitories, a food service, and classrooms for holding lectures.

==Ecology==
The waters surrounding San Juan Island are home to a variety of species including red sea urchins and pinto abalone. Though no commercial fishing of abalone has ever been allowed in this area, recreational fishing of abalone was outlawed in 1994. The National Marine Fisheries Service listed pinto abalone as a Species of Concern in 2004.

In 2015, San Juan Island became a protected location under The Antiquities Act. On March 25 of that year, former President Barack Obama included San Juan Island and approximately 75 other sites located in the Salish Sea into the San Juan Islands National Monument.

==Parks and recreation==
Lime Kiln Park is so named because it housed a lime kiln and is home to the historic Lime Kiln Light. Camping is also available around the island.

There are a few small, family-run aquaculture farms in the San Juan Islands including Westcott Bay Shellfish Co, where visitors can buy oysters, clams, and mussels and see shellfish farming operations. Whale watching and night-time bioluminescence tours depart from Friday Harbor.

<doc id="564333" wikidata="Q3806574" url="?curid=564333" title="A. James Gregor">
<text>Anthony James Gregor (April 2, 1929 – August 30, 2019) was an American political scientist and eugenicist and professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, known for his research on fascism, Marxism, and national security.

==Early life==
He was born Anthony Gimigliano in New York City. His father, Antonio, was a machine operator, factory worker and a nonpolitical anarchist. Gregor served as a volunteer in the U.S. Army. He attended and graduated in 1952 from Columbia University and thereafter served as a high school social science teacher while working for his advanced degrees. 

Prior to founding the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics, he published several articles on race science and syndicalism for Oswald Mosley&#x27;s &quot;The European&quot; and Corrado Gini’s &quot;Genus&quot;. Gregor&#x27;s first article in the latter was a defense of Gini&#x27;s theories, and the two subsequently became friends and collaborators until Gini&#x27;s death in 1965.
==Eugenics and philosophy==
In 1959, Gregor joined with Robert E. Kuttner to found the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics (IAAEE), where Gregor acted as secretary. According to Gregor, the organization was founded to restore &quot;an intellectual climate in the U.S., and throughout the Western World, which would permit a free and open discussion of racial ... problems.&quot; The organization was funded by segregationist Wickliffe Draper to oppose the civil rights movement. As part of this group, Gregor was also an assistant editor of, and contributor to, &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, the organization&#x27;s journal.

During this period he undertook anthropological field studies of aboriginal people in Central Australia, and similar studies in South Africa and in the southern United States. In 1960, he obtained employment as a philosophy instructor at Washington College, and in 1961 he received his doctorate at Columbia as an Irwin Edman Scholar and with Distinction in History after his dissertation on Giovanni Gentile. Gregor became assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Hawaii from 1961 to 1964. He became an associate professor of philosophy at the universities of Kentucky and Texas between 1964 and 1967. Gregor joined the Political Science Department at the University of California at Berkeley in 1967 where he remained until his retirement.

==Study of fascism==

Gregor was part of a movement of scholars in the 1960s who rejected the traditional interpretation of fascism as an ideologically empty, reactionary, antimodern dead end. He claimed Italian fascism owed a major debt to European ideological currents in sociology and political theory. Gregor described fascism as a coherent and serious theory of state and society, and argued that it played a revolutionary and modernizing role in European history. His theory of generic fascism portrayed it as a form of &quot;developmental dictatorship.&quot; Since the 1970s, Gregor spent most of his academic research on the study of fascism and it is for this that he is best known. In 1969, he published &quot;The Ideology of Fascism: The Rationale of Totalitarianism&quot;; in 1974, he wrote &quot;The Fascist Persuasion in Radical Politics&quot;. Since then he published other works on the subject, such as &quot;Mussolini&#x27;s Intellectuals&quot;, &quot;The Search for Neofascism&quot;, and &quot;Marxism, Fascism, and Totalitarianism&quot;.

Gregor argued that scholars do not agree on the definition of fascism, stating in 1997 that &quot;Almost every specialist has his own interpretation.&quot; He argued that Marxist movements of the 20th century discarded Marx and Engels and instead adopted theoretical categories and political methods much like those of Mussolini. In &quot;The Faces of Janus&quot; (2000) Gregor asserted that the original &quot;Fascists were almost all Marxists—serious theorists who had long been identified with Italy&#x27;s intelligentsia of the Left.&quot; In &quot;Young Mussolini&quot; (1979), Gregor describes Fascism as &quot;a variant of classical Marxism.&quot; According to Gregor, many revolutionary movements have assumed features of paradigmatic Fascism, but none are its duplicate. He said that post-Maoist China displays many of its traits. He denied that paradigmatic fascism can be responsibly identified as a form of right-wing extremism.

Sean Kennedy in &quot;Canadian Journal of History&quot; said in 2013, &quot;Over a long and distinguished career A. James Gregor has advanced some controversial interpretations of political ideologies. In particular, he holds that the Italian fascist regime is best understood as a &quot;developmental dictatorship,&quot; distinct from Nazism in key ways; a thesis that has proven surprisingly influential since 1945.&quot; According to Roger Griffin, Gregor wrote an influential early comprehensive survey of existing theoretical models of fascism. Per Andreas Umland writing for &quot;The American Historical Review&quot; in 2013, &quot;A. James Gregor has, for half a century, been one of the major makers and shapers of the discipline of comparative fascism.&quot;

==International relations==
Gregor said that he was committed to the American form of democratic liberalism, as he said that is the most effective system of government and the most likely to endure. In the 1960s, Gregor held numerous workshops and lectures to convince policymakers and academics to be supportive of the US role in the Vietnam War.

During the 1970s and 1980s Gregor served as an uncompensated adviser to Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who flew him to Honolulu as part of a &quot;counter-propaganda program&quot;, where he argued that the US should withhold support from Marcos&#x27;s democratic opposition over the latter&#x27;s opposition to US military bases, while downplaying allegations of human rights abuses as &quot;undocumented or purely hearsay&quot;. Gregor furnished names of &quot;other conservative academicians&quot; who would be useful for similar work, which were forwarded to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

His 1986 book, &quot;The China Connection: U.S. Policy and the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; and his 1987 follow-up, &quot;Arming the Dragon: U.S. Security Ties with the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, discussed Sino-American relations. In 1989 he wrote &quot;In the Shadow of Giants: The Major Powers and the Security of Southeast Asia&quot;. Gregor was named to the Oppenheimer Chair of Warfighting Strategy 1996–1997 at the Marine Corps University in Quantico.

Gregor translated some of the works of Italian fascist philosopher Giovanni Gentile into English, together with a commentary on Gentile&#x27;s political thought. Until his retirement in 2009, he taught a series of political science courses on revolutionary change, Marxism, and fascism at UC Berkeley. In 2014, Gregor published &quot;Marxism and the Making of China&quot;. In 2016, his work, &quot;Reflections on Italian Fascism&quot; was published in an English and Italian edition. His final project was an analytic study of the transformative revolution that shaped the twentieth century. In 2014, Princeton University Press incorporated his volumes, &quot;Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship&quot;, and &quot;The Fascist Persuasion in Radical Politics,&quot; among the books in their &quot;Princeton Legacy Library.&quot;

==Academic achievements==
Gregor was made a national Guggenheim Fellow; a Senior Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Social Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; H. L Oppenheimer Professor at the Marine Corps University, Quantico, Virginia; and a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

<text>Eskimo Joe are an Australian alternative rock band that was formed in 1997 by Stuart MacLeod, on lead guitar, Joel Quartermain, on drums and guitar, and Kavyen Temperley, on bass guitar and vocals, in East Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia.

The band has released five additional albums since their debut album &quot;Girl&quot; was released in 2001: &quot;A Song Is a City&quot;, released in 2004; &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot;, released in 2006; &quot;Inshalla&quot;, released in May 2009; &quot;Ghosts of the Past&quot;, released on 12 August 2011; and &quot;Wastelands&quot;, released on 20 September 2013. Eskimo Joe have won eight ARIA Music Awards; in 2006, the band achieved four wins—from nine nominations—for work associated with &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot;.

==History==

===1995–1999: Early years===
Eskimo Joe founders MacLeod and Temperley were school mates at John Curtin Senior High School. Temperley left school at sixteen to concentrate on writing music, moving into a share house with Simon Leach, who played bass guitar in a funk band called Carpet. The other members were his brother Stuart on drums and guitarist Joel Quartermain—all three were former students at Hollywood Senior High School. When Temperley joined Carpet they changed the name to Freud&#x27;s Pillow. The band performed around Perth and Fremantle from 1995 to 1998, and released an EP &quot;Pleasure Puppy&quot; in 1997; MacLeod, although not a member, is credited with co-writing &quot;Mr Hoek&quot; on the EP. Despite their modest popularity, Quartermain and Temperley were unhappy with the band&#x27;s musical style. While recording the EP, Temperley started jamming for a side project with MacLeod, writing several short and simple pop–punk songs. They auditioned a number of drummers and eventually settled on Quartermain, who they believed was more musical.

Formed as an alternative rock group in 1997 in East Fremantle, Eskimo Joe was initially a side project of Freud&#x27;s Pillow, with MacLeod on guitar, Quartermain on drums and guitar, and Temperley on bass guitar and vocals. Eskimo Joe&#x27;s first gig was in August 1997 at the University of Western Australia, in a local heat for the National Campus Band Competition—they proceeded to the state final in Perth and then the national final in Sydney. For winning the national final, they were awarded a place at the 1997 Livid Festival in Brisbane and a studio recording session in Sydney.

Freud&#x27;s Pillow officially split within a few months of Eskimo Joes&#x27; win. Simon Leach eventually formed Little Birdy in 2002, while Stuart played drums for One Horse Town and later for The Bank Holidays. In April 1998, Eskimo Joe recorded their debut release the &quot;Sweater&quot; EP. Its title track, &quot;Sweater&quot;, received significant airplay on national Australian radio station Triple J and reached No. 33 on the station&#x27;s Hottest 100 of 1998.

After touring for numerous months, Eskimo Joe returned to the studio and, in 1999, issued a second EP, the self-titled &quot;Eskimo Joe&quot;. Two tracks, &quot;Ruby Wednesday&quot; and &quot;Turn Up Your Stereo&quot;, were voted into the Triple J Hottest 100 of that year. The band were voted into the No. 2 position on the &#x27;Brightest Hope&#x27; list by the readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (Australia).

===1999–2001: &quot;Girl&quot;===
Eskimo Joe signed with Universal Records&#x27; alternative offshoot Modular, in 1999. They recorded their debut album, &quot;Girl&quot;, with producer Ed Buller (Ben Lee, Pulp, Suede). It reached No. 29 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold. Tracks such as &quot;Who Sold Her Out&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; received airplay on Triple J, with the former reaching the top 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart and the latter listed at No. 31 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of 2001. Some tracks featured on TV series, &quot;The Secret Life of Us&quot;. Rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, compared the album to their earlier work, &quot;The nonsensical songs about stereos, alcohol and farting were replaced by Beatlesque highly relatable songs about the ups and downs about the day-to-day life&quot;. The band&#x27;s live shows began to incorporate keyboards and an extra guitar. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the band&#x27;s single, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, with a promotional clip by Ben Saunders, won the &#x27;Best Video&#x27; category.

===2002–2005: &quot;A Song Is a City&quot;===
Despite &quot;Girl&quot; being a top 30 album and earning a gold record, Modular ended the band&#x27;s contract. Eskimo Joe signed with Festival Mushroom Records in 2002. They recorded their second album, &quot;A Song Is a City&quot;, produced by Paul McKercher and mixed by Nick Launay, in 2003. Released in May 2004, it peaked at No. 2 and, by 2006, achieved double platinum status. For live shows, Quartermain switched to guitar and Paul Keenan – also from Fremantle – played drums, and Dan Bull played keyboards. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Temperley explained: 

The lead single &quot;From the Sea&quot; reached the top 40 in March 2004, and was number-one on the Triple J Net 50. It was used as the backing track for a series of TV ads for the West Coast Eagles Football Club. &quot;Smoke&quot; was released as the second single and was listed in the top 5 on Triple J&#x27;s Net 50 in May. The third single, &quot;Older Than You&quot;, became their second top 50 ARIA Singles Chart hit after they performed it at the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 in October. At the ceremony, &quot;A Song Is a City&quot; won two awards for &#x27;Producer of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27; for both McKercher and Eskimo Joe. 

====DVD====
In August 2005, the &quot;Eskimo Joe&quot; DVD was released with all the film clips for tracks from the &quot;Eskimo Joe&quot; EP and the first two albums, a feature-length documentary, a collection of live performances, and some rare tracks, including &quot;Sweater&quot;. They won &#x27;Best Group&#x27; at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for &quot;Older Than You&quot;.

===2006–2008: &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot;===
MacLeod arranged for the band to produce their third album, &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot;, themselves, which &quot;shifted the emphasis from the songs and their performance to an over-all sound&quot;. Its title track, &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot;, released in May 2006, which peaked at No. 6, became their first Top 10 single. The song also reached No. 1 on ARIA&#x27;s digital track chart. The album followed in June and debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It spent 51 weeks in the Top 50 and achieved four times platinum status. Its second single, &quot;Sarah&quot;, was issued in September and peaked at No. 12. The B-sides are live and acoustic versions of &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot; and a cover of the Pixies&#x27; &quot;Hey&quot; recorded for Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Like a Version&quot; collection. The third single &quot;New York&quot; was released early in 2007 and reached No. 26. The fourth single, &quot;Breaking Up&quot;, in which the music video starred actress Teresa Palmer, attained the top 100.
 In August, &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot;, was issued as the band&#x27;s debut United States single. The fifth Australian single, &quot;London Bombs&quot;, was released in October as a digital only single. The song was awarded first place in the &#x27;Performance Category&#x27; at the 2007 International Songwriting Competition. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006, Eskimo Joe were nominated for nine awards and won four. &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot; won &#x27;Producer of the Year&#x27; for Eskimo Joe and &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27; for Matt Lovell, &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot; won &#x27;Single of the Year&#x27; and &quot;Eskimo Joe&quot; won Best Music DVD.

===2009-2010: &quot;Inshalla&quot;===
Their fourth studio album, &quot;Inshalla&quot;, was released in May 2009. The group had played tracks at gigs prior to its release, including the title track, &quot;Inshalla&quot;. The term, &quot;insha&#x27;Allah&quot; is Arabic for &#x27;God willing&#x27; which Temperley had heard during a visit to Egypt. According to Nimmervoll, &quot;The album was put together in the same spirit, instead of the extremelely focused record they had wanted with &quot;Black Fingernails, Red Wine&quot; with &quot;Inshalla&quot; Eskimo Joe let the songs and the music take them wherever they led&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Foreign Land&quot;, was issued in April and peaked at No. 13. &quot;Inshalla&quot; became the band&#x27;s second album to debut at No. 1, and remained in the charts for 17 weeks. It was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009 for &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27;. The second single, &quot;Losing Friends Over Love&quot;, released in June failed to chart. However, the third single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, which was released in September, reached No. 50.

===2011: &quot;Ghosts of the Past&quot;===
They recorded their fifth album, &quot;Ghosts of the Past&quot;, in February 2011 at The Grove Studios in Sydney and the new Wasteland Studios in O&#x27;Connor, which is owned by the band under their own label, Dirt Diamonds. In May, the group announced that &quot;Ghosts of the Past&quot; was due for release on 12 August. It has the band aiming for more honesty and less polish than &quot;Inshalla&quot;. The album will contain 12 new songs. Some tracks include &quot;Love Is a Drug&quot;, &quot;Itch&quot;, &quot;Running&quot;, &quot;Speeding Car&quot;, &quot;When We Were Kids&quot; and &quot;Gave It All Away&quot;. The first single from the album &quot;Love Is a Drug&quot; was first performed at 2011 Southbound Music Festival in Busselton and was released on iTunes on 24 June.

===2012–2013: &quot;Wastelands&quot;===
To record the band&#x27;s sixth album, a fundraising campaign was launched in November 2012 through the Pozible website (a service also used by fellow Australian musician Clare Bowditch for her Big Hearted Business initiative)—Pozible is self described as &quot;a crowdfunding platform and community-building tool for creative projects and ideas. It was developed to help people raise funds, realise their aspirations and make great things possible.&quot; As of 8 February 2013, the campaign had raised AUS$60,636 in pledges, with 12 hours to go, above the initial target of AUS$40,000. In its subscriber newsletter, the band revealed that:
The decision to crowd fund the new album has allowed the band to take a fresh approach with the new album and work unhindered to create the strongest possible new work. With all of the generosity and support the band has received, the campaign has been successful and the band are now looking forward to beginning work on the album in March.

The band also offered previews of the pre-production process for the sixth album on its official YouTube channel—the first preview was published on 17 December 2012, while subsequent video segments were published on 14 January 2013 and 28 January 2013.

Temperley revealed in a pre-album-release interview that the band felt &quot;dusty&quot; following the decreased popularity of &quot;Ghosts of the Past&quot;. He explained, &quot;We needed a third party to come in so we could just be a band&quot; and stated that the band was motivated to hire producer Burke Reid after he admitted that he was not a fan of their music. Temperley also provided insight into the album&#x27;s musical influences, citing Leonard Cohen and stating, &quot;I always refer back to the sounds I have always loved and for me Beck and LCD Soundsystem are where it&#x27;s at.&quot; Two synthesizers that belonged to Temperley, a Jupiter 4 and a Roland Compurhythm 100, were used during the entire recording process.

The release of &quot;Wastelands&quot; on 20 September 2013 was accompanied by a livestreamed session (using the Soundrop app, part of the Spotify music website) consisting of a live chat and a performance of the new album.

===2020–present: &quot;The World Repeats Itself Somehow&quot;===
On 26 June 2020, Eskimo Joe released &quot;Say Something&quot;, their first single in seven years.

In September 2021, the band announced their first greatest hits album, &quot;The World Repeats Itself Somehow&quot;, which was released on 10 December 2021.

==Tours==
In November 2006, Eskimo Joe played at the CMJ Music Festival in New York City, returning to Australia for Southbound in Western Australia and the Falls Festival in Victoria and Tasmania. They performed on all legs of the 2007 Big Day Out concerts. In July, they played at the Australian leg of Live Earth in Sydney. At the end of that month, they had a secret gig in Perth under a pseudonym, The Andy Callison Project, as a warm-up to their US tour. Joining Eskimo Joe&#x27;s line-up for live shows were Lee Jones on keyboards and Shaun Sibbes on drums. In January 2008, Eskimo Joe performed in New York, Houston and Los Angeles as part of the annual G&#x27;day USA – Australia Week. Later that year, the group performed at both the East Coast and West Coast Blues &amp; Roots Festivals (Byron Bay and Fremantle, respectively).

In March 2009, Eskimo Joe performed at the Sound Relief concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Sound Relief was a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland floods. Appearing with Eskimo Joe at the Sydney concert were, Coldplay, Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, Jet, Josh Pyke, Little Birdy, The Presets, Wolfmother, You Am I and additional artists. Prior to the benefit concert the band played in Perth as The Andy Callison Project.

On 22 August 2012, the band was announced as the opening act for the launch of the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival in Australia.

The &#x27;Winter Warmer&#x27; tour was announced in late May 2013 and the band explained that they would be playing acoustically at intimate and unusual venues across Australia. The tour will consist of two-hour acoustic-based shows in which the band will reinterpret a selection of songs from every album in the band&#x27;s history. Temperley stated: &quot;We&#x27;ve got a few a new songs that we&#x27;re going to try out acoustically with some re-working of old songs too. We feel really lucky to have such a beautiful and unique venues to do this in.&quot;

To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the &quot;Song Is A City&quot; album, described by Temperley as a &quot;turning point for myself both personally and musically&quot;, Temperley announced a solo Australian tour in June 2014. Temperley explained, &quot;I love it how the whole album works on just an acoustic guitar, and there are so many stories that now, from a safe distance, I’m ready to tell&quot;, in regard to the tour that will occur from July to September 2014. During the tour, Temperley will 
share the stories that influenced the songs and will also play cover versions of some songs that influenced the album.

==Other activities==
In April 2010, Eskimo Joe were announced as the &#x27;number-one ticket-holder&#x27; for the Fremantle Football Club, replacing golfer Nick O&#x27;Hern. Quartermain joked that they may pen a club song: &quot;We&#x27;ll give it a crack. We&#x27;re back here this winter writing our new record so, while we&#x27;re at it, we may as well knock off a new theme song.&quot; The band held the honour until 2012, being replaced by Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith.

A National Office for Live Music was launched by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in July 2013; and, as of August 2013, Temperley is the state ambassador for Western Australia.

<text>Ramón Gil Samaniego (February 6, 1899 – October 30, 1968), known professionally as Ramon Novarro, was a Mexican actor. He began his career in American silent films in 1917 and eventually became a leading man and one of the top box-office attractions of the 1920s and early 1930s. Novarro was promoted by MGM as a &quot;Latin lover&quot; and became known as a sex symbol after the death of Rudolph Valentino. He is recognized as the first Latin American actor to succeed in Hollywood.

== Early life ==
Novarro was born Ramón Gil Samaniego on February 6, 1899, in Durango City, Durango, north-west Mexico, to Dr. Mariano N. Samaniego, and his wife, Leonor Pérez Gavilán. The family moved to Los Angeles to escape the Mexican Revolution in 1913. Novarro&#x27;s direct ancestors came from the Castilian town of Burgos, whence two brothers emigrated to the New World in the seventeenth century.

Allan Ellenberger, Novarro&#x27;s biographer, writes:
The family estate was called the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot;. Thirteen children were born there: Emilio; Guadalupe; Rosa; Ramón; Leonor; Mariano; Luz; Antonio; José; a stillborn child; Carmen; Ángel and Eduardo. At the time of the Mexican Revolution, the family moved from Durango to Mexico City and then returned to Durango. Three of Ramón&#x27;s sisters, Guadalupe, Rosa, and Leonor, became nuns. He was a second cousin of the Mexican actresses Dolores del Río and Andrea Palma.

== Career ==
=== Silent films ===

Novarro began his film career in 1917, playing bit parts, supplementing his income by working as a singing waiter, a taxi dancer and as a dancer in revues choreographed by Ernest Belcher (father of Marge Champion). His friends, actor and director Rex Ingram and his wife, actress Alice Terry, began to promote him as a rival to Rudolph Valentino, and Ingram suggested he change his name to &quot;Novarro&quot;. From 1923, he began to play more prominent roles. His role in &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1923) brought him his first major success.

Novarro achieved his greatest success in 1925, in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. His revealing costumes caused a sensation. He was elevated into the Hollywood elite. As did many stars, Novarro engaged Sylvia of Hollywood as a physical therapist (although in her tell-all book, Sylvia erroneously claimed that Novarro slept in a coffin). With Valentino&#x27;s death in 1926, Novarro became the screen&#x27;s leading Latin actor, though ranked lower than his MGM contemporary John Gilbert as a leading man. Novarro was popular as a swashbuckler in action roles, and considered one of the great romantic lead actors of his day. He appeared with Norma Shearer in &quot;The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg&quot; (1927) and with Joan Crawford in &quot;Across to Singapore&quot; (1928).

=== Talking films ===
He made his first talking film, starring as a singing French soldier, in &quot;Devil-May-Care&quot; (1929). He starred with Dorothy Janis in &quot;The Pagan&quot; (1929), with Greta Garbo in &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1931), with Myrna Loy in &quot;The Barbarian&quot; (1933) and opposite Lupe Vélez in &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; (1934).

When his contract with MGM Studios expired in 1935 and the studio did not renew it, Novarro continued to act sporadically, appearing in films for Republic Pictures, a Mexican religious drama, and a French comedy. In the 1940s, he had several small roles in American films, including &quot;We Were Strangers&quot; (1949), directed by John Huston and starring Jennifer Jones and John Garfield. In 1958, he was considered for a role in the television series &quot;The Green Peacock&quot;, with Howard Duff and Ida Lupino, after their CBS Television sitcom &quot;Mr. Adams and Eve&quot; (1957–58). The project, however, never materialized. A Broadway tryout was aborted in the 1960s. Novarro kept busy on television, appearing in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The High Chaparral&quot; as late as 1968.

At the peak of his success in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Novarro was earning more than US$100,000 per film. He invested some of his income in real estate, and his Hollywood Hills residence is one of the more renowned designs (1927) by Lloyd Wright, the son of Frank Lloyd Wright. When his career ended, he was still able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

== Personal life ==

In 1925, Novarro purchased a home in &quot;the exclusive West Adams district&quot; of Los Angeles for $12,000 and spent an additional $100,000 on renovations.

Novarro was troubled all his life by his conflicted feelings toward his Roman Catholic faith and his homosexuality. His life-long struggle with alcoholism is often traced to these problems. In the early 1920s Novarro had a romantic relationship with composer Harry Partch, who was working as an usher at the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the time, but Novarro broke off the affair as he achieved greater success as an actor. He was romantically involved with Hollywood journalist Herbert Howe, who was also his publicist in the late 1920s, and with a wealthy philanthropist and arts patron from San Francisco, Noël Sullivan.

Along with Dolores del Río, Lupe Vélez and James Cagney, Novarro was accused of promoting communism in California after they attended a special screening of the film &quot;¡Que viva México!&quot; by Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein.

== Murder ==
Novarro was murdered on October 30, 1968, by brothers Paul and Tom Ferguson, aged 22 and 17, who called him and offered their sexual services. In the past, he had hired prostitutes from an agency to come to his Laurel Canyon home for sex, and the Fergusons obtained Novarro&#x27;s telephone number from a previous guest.

According to the prosecution in the murder case, the two young men believed that a large sum of money was hidden in Novarro&#x27;s house. The prosecution accused the brothers of torturing Novarro for several hours to force him to reveal where the (non-existent) money was hidden. They left the house with $20 they took from his bathrobe pocket. Novarro died as a result of asphyxiation, having choked to death on his own blood after being beaten. The two perpetrators were caught and sentenced to long prison terms, but released on parole in the mid-1970s. Both were later re-arrested for unrelated crimes for which they served longer prison terms than for the murder of Novarro. In a 1998 interview, Paul Ferguson finally assumed the blame for Novarro&#x27;s death. Tom Ferguson committed suicide on March 6, 2005. Paul Ferguson was beaten to death in prison by a fellow inmate in 2018, while serving out a 60-year sentence for rape in Missouri.

Novarro is buried in Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles, California.

Novarro&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is at 6350 Hollywood Boulevard.

== In popular culture ==
* In a 1961 episode of the &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; TV show, Bonnie Kalsheim (guest-star Alice Ghostley) reveals that she was &quot;ruined&quot; by Ramon Novarro. When pressed for details, she admits that her adoration of the star&#x27;s screen presence had made every other man distastefully unsuitable to her as a potential love match.
* Novarro&#x27;s murder served as the basis for the short story by Charles Bukowski titled &quot;The Murder of Ramon Vasquez&quot;, as well as for the song &quot;Tango,&quot; by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, recorded by Peggy Lee on her &quot;Mirrors&quot; album.
* Novarro&#x27;s murder is one of the events in 1960s-California mentioned in Joan Didion&#x27;s essay &quot;The White Album&quot;, included in the 1979 book of the same name.

* In late 2005, the Wings Theatre in New York City staged the world premiere of &quot;Through a Naked Lens&quot; by George Barthel. The play combined fact and fiction to depict Novarro&#x27;s rise to fame and his relationship with Hollywood journalist Herbert Howe.
* Novarro&#x27;s relationship with Howe is discussed in two biographies: Allan R. Ellenberger&#x27;s &quot;Ramón Novarro&quot; and André Soares&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramón Novarro.&quot;

<text>Lanzhou University () is a public university in Lanzhou, Gansu, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Founded in 1909, the university provides programs for undergraduate, graduate students on four campuses—three in Lanzhou city centre and one in Yuzhong County, about 30 miles away from the main campus. It is one of the first universities in China to set up a national basic science research and teaching talent training base for arts and sciences, one of the first universities selected for the National College Student Innovative Experiment Program, and one of the 19 universities in China to implement a pilot program for training top students in basic disciplines. As of now, there are 20,686 undergraduate students, 15,081 master&#x27;s degree students and 5,326 doctoral students. There are 99 undergraduate majors and 16 national characteristic majors.

==History==
Lanzhou University&#x27;s history traces back to 1909 when its predecessor, the &quot;Gansu School of Law and Politics&quot;, was founded. The School of Law and Politics became the Sun Yat-sen &quot;University of Lanzhou&quot; in 1928 and from 1945, the National Lanzhou University. After 1949, it went by the name &quot;Lanzhou University&quot;. It was designated one of China&#x27;s 14 key universities.

In 1932 the &quot;Lanzhou Medical College&quot; and its affiliated hospital were founded.

In 2002 the &quot;Gansu Grassland Ecology Research Institute&quot;, and in 2004 the Lanzhou Medical College were incorporated into Lanzhou University.

Lanzhou University is noted for being one of China&#x27;s premier institutions of higher learning with its position as the best university in Northwestern China.

&quot;Lanzhou University&quot; was one of the first universities entitled to enroll Bachelor Master’s and Doctoral degree candidates in 1981.

In 2017, Lanzhou University was designated as a class A university in the Double First-Class Construction.

Lanzhou University maintains one of China&#x27;s top ten Ph.D. programs in physics, chemistry, atmospheric sciences and geography and highly ranked programs in information science, biology, botany, mathematics, history, media, ecology and Chinese literature. It is especially noted in fundamental science, ranked in the top 1% of the Essential Science Indicators index.

The landing system of China&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 4 lunar lander was thanks to a &quot;Lanzhou University&quot; developed gamma shutdown sensor.
==Primary laboratories==

Lanzhou University has three primary laboratories and analytical testing facility sanctioned by the Chinese Ministry of Education and deemed as high importance to the state.

===Laboratory of Arid Agroecology===
The laboratory was founded in 1991 under ratification of the Planning Commission of China and engaged in arid agriculture ecology research. The Laboratory of Arid Agroecology is the only lab engaged in arid agriculture ecology research under the Chinese Ministry of Education. The lab has been highly developed on the basis of the authorization to confer bachelor, masters, doctorate and post-doctoral degrees through the financial aid of the World Bank loan.

===Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry===
The Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry was one of the first state key laboratories ratified by Planning Commission of China. It was founded in December 1987, open to visiting scholars and scientists from both within China and abroad. It is one primary laboratories to cultivate talents for organic chemistry. The researches of the laboratory focus on organic molecular chemistry of special function, especially in the field of basic research on active organic molecules.

===Open Laboratory of Applied Magnetism===
Created in 1993 by the Chinese Ministry of Education, this is an open laboratory conducting research in the field of Applied Magnetism. The lab is chiefly engaged in studies on applications of perpendicular magnetic recording. The laboratory also conducts research and development on new applied magnetic materials which can be used for commercial applications. Mossbauer spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resource spin echo spectroscopy and general magnetic testing media are used to study magnetic materials&#x27; microscopic structure and general magnetic behavior. The laboratory is equipped with major facilities including a vibrating sample magnetometer, high pressure mossbauer spectroscope and magnetron sputtering system, along with many others. The lab also serves as a key resource for research in materials science and condensed matter physics.

The laboratory has 24 professional researchers and technicians, among who are 4 doctoral advisers.

===Analytical Testing Center===
Financed by the first loan issued by the World Bank to develop universities, construction on this center began in 1982. It contains more than 20 major instruments and devices including a High-Resolution Mass Spectrometer, Infrared Spectrometer, X-Ray Quadrupole Diffractometer, Laser Raman Spectrometer, FT-IR Spectrometer, and others. The center is primarily engaged in the determination and analysis of the structure of matter. It also conducts graduate students&#x27; experiments which leads to the conferring of Master&#x27;s and Ph.D. degrees. A testing service is available to the public.

Established by the State Technology Superintendency in 1992, it is the approved lab for the inspection of imported and exported chemical and mining products.

== Campus ==

Lanzhou University has two campuses. The oldest campus is located in the center of Lanzhou (Chengguan District), whereas the main campus is located in Yuzhong County. The One Belt and One Road campus, north of Lanzhou is under construction.

There are 6 National Bases for the Training of Researching and Teaching personnel for Fundamental Disciplines. The University operates an additional 35 institutes along with 1 national key Laboratory of the Applied Organic and 3 key laboratories of Arid and Grassland Ecology, West China Environment, Magnetism and Magnetic Materials of the Ministry of Education, a key laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystem of the Ministry of Agriculture.

<doc id="564355" wikidata="Q5305682" url="?curid=564355" title="Dram shop">
<text>A dram shop (or dramshop) is a bar, tavern or similar commercial establishment where alcoholic beverages are sold. Traditionally, it is a shop where spirits were sold by the dram, a small unit of liquid.

Dram shop liability refers to the body of law governing the liability of taverns, liquor stores, and other commercial establishments that serve alcoholic beverages. Within the United States, laws that impose potential liability upon businesses that sell alcohol for injuries caused by their patrons are usually called &quot;dram shop laws&quot; or &quot;dram shop acts&quot;.

Generally, dram shop laws establish the liability of establishments arising out of the sale of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors who subsequently cause death or injury to third parties (those not having a relationship to the business that sold the alcohol) as a result of alcohol-related car crashes and other accidents.

The laws are intended to protect the general public from the hazards of serving alcohol to minors and intoxicated patrons. Groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) have advocated for the enforcement and enactment of dram shop laws across the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The earliest dram shop laws date from the 19th-century temperance movement.

==United States==
Serving alcohol to minors is illegal in all 50 states. Many states impose liability on bars for serving minors who subsequently injure themselves or others, to deter bars from serving alcohol to minors. Thus in states like Texas and New Jersey, minors can sue a drinking establishment for their own injuries sustained while intoxicated. In Texas, this also applies to a minor served alcohol at a residential property. In other states, dram shop liability only extends to serving the &quot;habitually intoxicated&quot;.

The majority of states allow for recovery when the defendant knew (or should have known) the customer was intoxicated. Some states have attempted to address this problem through more exacting tests. Many states impose liability on social hosts as well as commercial establishments. This related area of the law is known as social host liability.

Different states&#x27; dram shop acts also differ as to whether a person who becomes intoxicated and injures themselves has a cause of action against the establishment that served them. Some states, such as New Jersey, will allow such a cause of action but will instruct the jury to take the intoxicated person&#x27;s own negligence into account. Other states, such as New York, will not allow a person who injures themselves to bring a lawsuit against the bar that served them, but if that person dies will allow such a person&#x27;s children to sue the drinking establishment for loss of parental consortium.

===Illinois===
Under Illinois&#x27; dram shop law, plaintiffs can recover after demonstrating that: 
#alcohol was sold to the patron by the defendant;
#damages were sustained by the plaintiff;
#the sale of alcohol was the proximate cause of the intoxication; and
#intoxication was at least one cause of the plaintiff&#x27;s damages.

Proximate cause includes the requirement that the dram shop must have been able to foresee that its actions could cause injuries to third parties, but this is true for any establishment that serves (sells) alcohol. One Illinois court allowed a lawsuit against a company that dropped off self-serve barrels of beer at a union picnic.

===Maryland===
In the state of Maryland there is no dram shop statute.

Maryland only imposes social host liability on adults who knowingly and willfully provide alcohol to minors. Social host liability was recognized by the Maryland Court of Appeals on July 5, 2016, pursuant to ruling that adults should be responsible for the actions of the underage drinkers they host, because those under 21 aren&#x27;t competent to handle the potentially dangerous effects of alcohol.

===Massachusetts===
In Massachusetts, the state&#x27;s highest court has held that a bar could be sued where a patron exhibiting &quot;drunk, loud and vulgar&quot; behavior was determined to be &quot;visibly intoxicated&quot;. In that case, the evidence showed that the intoxicated patron had been served six or more White Russians by a bar. The patron left the bar, arriving at another bar about fifteen minutes later &quot;totally drunk&quot;, holding a White Russian. The next bar that he went to refused to serve him. Shortly thereafter, the intoxicated patron lost control of his car, drove on a sidewalk, and killed a pedestrian.

===Missouri===
Missouri&#x27;s dram shop law requires proof that the party demonstrates &quot;significantly uncoordinated physical action or significant physical dysfunction.&quot;

===New York===
To recover damages under the New York state dram shop law, a plaintiff must prove the following:
#the plaintiff suffered injury or damages as the result of the actions of an intoxicated individual,
#the defendant served alcohol to the intoxicated person who caused the damages or injury, and
#the defendant, therefore contributed to the further intoxication of the individual.

===Texas===
In Texas, a patron must be so obviously intoxicated that he presents a clear danger to himself and others. Dram shops are able to protect themselves from any claims of liability provided they are able to prove that they require all their employees to attend a TABC-approved &quot;seller training program&quot; and that the employee accused of over-serving an intoxicated individual actually attended the program. If these criteria are met, then any plaintiff seeking to sue the dram shop must prove that the employer either directly or indirectly encouraged said employee to violate the Texas Dram Shop Act in order for there to be liability. This dram shop immunity is called &quot;The Safe Harbor&quot;.

==Effectiveness==
A 1993 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found some reduction in alcohol-related fatalities from the implementation of dram shop laws though it did not control for the special cases of Utah and Nevada, which may have distorted the results. A 2011 survey of eleven studies measuring dram shop acts against alcohol-related harms found strong evidence of the effectiveness of dram shop laws in reducing those harms.

<text>Elaine Lobl Konigsburg (February 10, 1930 – April 19, 2013) was an American writer and illustrator of children&#x27;s books and young adult fiction. She is one of six writers to win two Newbery Medals, the venerable American Library Association award for the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American children&#x27;s literature.&quot;

Konigsburg submitted her first two manuscripts to editor Jean Karl at Atheneum Publishers in 1966, and both were published in 1967: &quot;Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler&quot;. &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler&quot; won the 1968 Newbery Medal, and &quot;Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth&quot; was listed as a runner-up in the same year, making Konigsburg the only author to win the Newbery Medal and have another book listed as runner-up in the same year. She won again for &quot;The View from Saturday&quot; in 1997, 29 years later, the longest span between two Newberys awarded to one author.

For her contribution as a children&#x27;s writer Konigsburg was U.S. nominee in 2006 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition available to creators of children&#x27;s books.

==Biography==

Elaine Lobl was born in New York City on February 10, 1930, but grew up in small Pennsylvania towns, the second of three daughters. She was born to two Jewish immigrants who moved from New York City to a mill town in Pennsylvania. She was an avid reader, although reading was only &quot;tolerated&quot; in her family, &quot;not sanctioned like dusting furniture or baking cookies&quot;. She was high school valedictorian in Farrell, Pennsylvania, where there was no guidance counseling and she never heard of scholarships. To earn money for college, she worked as a bookkeeper at a meat plant, where she met David Konigsburg, the brother of one of the owners.

Elaine entered Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and majored in chemistry, with her &quot;artistic side ... essentially dormant&quot;, because she was good at it and the purpose of college was &quot;to become a &quot;something&quot; - a librarian, a teacher, a chemist, a &quot;something&quot;&quot;. She graduated in 1952 and was the first person in her family to earn a degree. After graduating, Elaine married David, who was then a graduate student in psychology. She started graduate school in chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh (1952 to 1954) but they moved to Jacksonville, Florida, after he attained his doctorate. She worked as a science teacher at Bartram School for Girls until 1955; became the mother of three children, Paul, Laurie, and Ross (1955 to 1959); began painting at adult education after two children; and planned for the time they would all be in school.

Konigsburg took the new direction after the family moved to Port Chester in Greater New York (1962), where she continued art lessons and joined the Art Students League. She began to write in the mornings when her third child started school. Her first published story &quot;Jennifer, Hecate&quot; was inspired by Laurie&#x27;s experience as a new girl in Port Chester. &quot;Mixed-Up Files&quot; was inspired by her children&#x27;s complaints about a picnic with many amenities of home; she inferred that if they ever ran away &quot;[t]hey would certainly never consider any place less elegant than the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&quot;

Konigsburg learned of those first two books&#x27; 1968 Newbery Award and honorable mention during her family&#x27;s move back from Port Chester to Jacksonville. When she composed her autobiographical statement for &quot;The Book of Junior Authors&quot; (2000), she lived &quot;on the beach in North Florida&quot;. The pieces of &quot;The View From Saturday&quot; (1996) had come together when she &quot;left my desk and took a walk along the beach&quot;.

As summarized by critic Marah Gubar, &quot;For five decades, Konigsburg challenged readers by tackling subjects often avoided in children’s books, from the undercurrent of hostility that runs through an interracial friendship to the domestic unrest generated by the stirrings of pubescent and parental sexuality... Konigsburg was committed to depicting young people as capable knowers of what goes on in their own minds, homes, and the wider world they inhabit. Bad things happen in her novels when adult characters fail to respect this competence. At the same time, however, Konigsburg emphasizes that all knowledge is perspectival; the particular social position that each of us inhabits shapes what we know and how we come to know it.&quot;

Along with chapter books, some of which she illustrated, Konigsburg is the writer and illustrator of three 1990s picture books &quot;featuring her own grandchildren&quot;: &quot;Samuel Todd&#x27;s Book of Great Colors&quot;, &quot;Samuel Todd&#x27;s Book of Great Inventions&quot;, and &quot;Amy Elizabeth Explores Bloomingdale&#x27;s&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1952, she married David Konigsburg, with whom she had three children, Paul (born 1955), Laurie (born 1956), and Ross (born 1959). As of 2002, she had five grandchildren, Samuel Todd and Amy Elizabeth being the eldest children of Laurie and Ross. Her husband, David Konigsburg, died in 2001.

Konigsburg died in Falls Church, Virginia, on April 19, 2013, from complications of a stroke that she had suffered a week prior. She was 83.

Konigsburg was a longtime resident of Jacksonville, Florida, and Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.

==Themes==

Many of Konigsburg&#x27;s stories feature childhood and adolescent struggles that are easy for school-age readers to understand. Often her characters are striving to find the answers to big questions that will help shape their identities. Many of them are based on her own experiences as a child, the observations she made of children while a teacher, and the experiences or observations of her children.

Especially her characters are &quot;softly comfortable on the outside and solidly uncomfortable on the inside&quot;. Teaching at Bartram, she learned that supposed &quot;spoiled young women who had it all [actually] &quot;had&quot; all the creature comforts of the world, but ... were just as uncomfortable inside as I was when I was growing up.&quot; Later she realized that her own children were middle-class suburban kids with comforts unlike her own. She has written about &quot;their kind of growing up, something that addressed the problems that come about even though you don&#x27;t have to worry if you wear out your shoes whether your parents can buy you a new pair, something that tackles the basic problems of who am I?&quot;

She has told Scholastic Teachers, &quot;The essential problems remain the same. The kids I write about are asking for the same things I wanted. They want two contradictory things. They want to be the same as everyone else, and they want to be different from everyone else.They want acceptance for both.&quot;

Two books by Konigsburg were finalists for the National Book Award in &quot;Children&#x27;s&quot; categories (1969 to 1983), the historical novel &quot;A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver&quot; in 1974 and the short story collection &quot;Throwing Shadows&quot; in 1980. &quot;A Proud Taste&quot; was the 1993 Phoenix Award runner-up and &quot;Throwing Shadows&quot; won the 1999 Phoenix. That Children&#x27;s Literature Association award recognizes the best children&#x27;s book published 20 years earlier that did not win a major award; it is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the winning book&#x27;s rise from obscurity.
