<text>Nadiad is a city in the state of Gujarat, India and the administrative centre of the Kheda district. It is known for the Santram Mandir, the Mai Mandir, It is the birthplace of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister of India.

==History==
There is a belief that the old name of Nadiad was Natpur or Natdra, and this town was settled by the Nat people. The mostly lands and property owners in Nadiad are ‘Patel &amp; Desai’. Indulal Yagnik wrote in his autobiography that in the last century, who would deny that Desai and Nagars had played a strange game of miraculous theatrics of politics on the stage of Mahagujarat? Below the Derasar idol of Rupa Parekh&#x27;s Pol of Nadiad is the name Natiadra, which shows that the existence of Nadiad will be in the name of Natiadra in the period from 9 to 129 AD. Remains of this city have been found around Bhairavna temple on Dakor Road around AD 7. The author of &#x27;Narsanda Darshan&#x27; has mentioned the name of Nadiad as &#x27;Naginabad&#x27;. 
If the word Saksharbhoomi is heard in the ears of any Gujarati anywhere in the world, then he will understand the exact mention of Nadiad. There are nine literates here, which means that there are not as many writers in other cities as 5th Nadiad? Nadiad was becoming the center of literary and cultural activities in Gujarat in the late 19th century, i.e. between 150 and 1800 AD. In 1918, English domination was established in Gujarat and higher education of universities was started. In this way, through the connection with English education, English language and English culture, English Gujaratis, especially the Suratis, started the reform movement. At this time, Nadiad became the center for the preservation of Indian culture and heritage. In that era of kingdoms, four friends from here, Manasukhram Tripathi, Manibhai Jashbhai, Haridas Viharidas Desai (Bhau Saheb) and Ranchodram Udayaram&#x27;s congregation were persecuted in many princely states from Mumbai to Kutch for their skill, study and diplomacy. Indulal Yagnik notes that taking advantage of Manasukhraya and Haridas, many Desais and citizens of Nadiad entered several states and became rich through Satadhari. In this way, the literate people of Nadiad, shining with the triple splendor of Lakshmi, Saraswati and Rajasthan, studied Indian and English culture in such a detailed manner that nowhere else in Gujarat. Thus, the protection of Arya Sanskrit is getting the pride of literacy even today as a result of the smoke which Kaj Nadiad smoked. In Nadiad, nine literates simultaneously spread their literary talents all over Gujarat. Gujarati literature has made a name for itself in world literature with the novel Saraswati Chandra by Govardhanram Tripathi. On this occasion, Manasukhram Tripathi, Zaverilal Umiyashankar Yagnik, Dolatram Kriparam Pandya, Balashankar Ullasram Kantharia, Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi, Chhaganlal Harilal Pandya, Ambalal Bulakhiram Jani, Champashankar Narmadashankar Pandya and Moolshankar Maneklal Yagnik were named as the nine literates of Nadiad. For this Nadiad with nine divisions, nine gates, nine lakes, Gujarat Urmikavi Nanalal has rightly said that Gujarat was looking for literacy in the whole of Nadiad.
More than 270 writers from Nadiad, whose birthplace, karma bhoomi or homeland have been living in this land. Perhaps in the middle class towns of Gujarat, such and such writers have not been found anywhere else. Is. Mogul Azam&#x27;s popular song Pankit Mohe Nadhat Pe Nandlal Nadiad&#x27;s Rasakavi Radhunath Brahmbhat has written. Nadiad is the hometown of the poet Vindhalbhai patel, who sang a lie in Bobby, a successful surgeon from Rajakpur. Gujarat&#x27;s legendary comedian Bakul Tripathi, well-known poet-writer Pururaj Joshi and successful storyteller Evadev are also from Nadiad. Indulal Yagnik, Jashwant Thacker, Maganbhai Desai, D.B. Govindbhai Desai, Desaibhai Nathabhai patel, Prabodh Parikh, Pu.Mota, Mahesh Chanlal, Krishnashankar Shastri (Pu.Dadaji) are some of the creators who have gifted this land. Out of these two and a half hundred and fifty writers, 24 creators are found from the same path, while the fragrance of many other great creators is lingering in the alleys of Nadiad. Introduced in books like Nadiad&#x27;s Akshardeh and A.Sau. Will be available from a permanent exhibition held at the Dahilaxmi Library.
Apart from literacy, Nadiad is also known as the village of Jai Maharaj. Because 150 years ago today, Dattatreya Swaru Yogiraj Avadhut Santram Maharaj lived here and spread the light of divine light. This Santram Maharaj has composed the best poems of Gyanbhakti under the name of Sukhsagar and many other poets of his saintly life have also given the best poems.

<text>Klaus Wunderlich (18 June 1931 – 28 October 1997) was a famous German easy listening organist.

== Biography ==
Wunderlich was born in Chemnitz. He played the Hammond organ model C3 then mid 60s changed to model Hammond H100. Wunderlich also tried new sounds and released an album exclusively played on Hohner instruments: model Planet T, Clavinet D6 and String Melody string synthesizer (also branded as Logan String Melody.) With the introduction of the first synthesizers, Wunderlich briefly used Moog synthesizer and produced three albums with the instrument. He later combined the sound of a Hammond organ model H 100 with a Lowrey Organ Model H25-3 and Wersi model W248S which was called the &quot;New Pop Organ Sound&quot;. Wunderlich switched to Wersi organs permanently with the introduction of the Wersi Helios model in 1976, with which he created his own unique electronic sound. During the course of time, the Wersi Helios was not sufficient to keep up with current technology and trends so Wunderlich started to use Wersi Beta Dx400. The Beta was then combined with the Wersi Helios to again create a unique sound. The 1980s saw Wunderlich purchase the Wersi Pianostar electronic piano which he used for rhythm guitar effects only.

In 1988, Wunderlich decided to part company with the Wersi Helios and Beta and purchased a new organ to replace both older models, the Wersi Spectra.

Wunderlich also used a small Moog synthesizer Minimoog to replicate the sound of the Bass guitar on his recordings as well as in the latter half of his career playing the drums and percussion on his recordings.

As a musician Wunderlich was open to different music styles and played classical, operetta, Broadway musical, as well as popular music. He sold more than 20 million records globally, and received 13 golden albums as well as one golden cassette.

Wunderlich died in Engen.

Some of his work was incorporated into the Soviet cartoon, &quot;Nu Pogodi!&quot;

In 2017, a documentary film about Klaus Wunderlich was released by Duke Denver Film IVS called &quot;Wunderlich&quot;. The year after a sequel was released titled &quot;Wunderlich Stories&quot;.

Over the years his recordings have been sampled by a number of other artists. One of the most notable and unusual is the use of multiple elements, including the distinctive organ from his version of the Lynsey de Paul song, &quot;Sugar Me&quot;, that was sampled by Guru on track 5 on his 2000 album, &quot;Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul&quot;, called &quot;Certified&quot; performed by Bilal.

==Discography (small selection)==
Wunderlich released more than one hundred albums, of which thirteen LP&#x27;s and one music cassette was credited with gold. In the following overview the chart positions in Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are given:

<text>Halberstadt (; Eastphalian: &quot;Halverstidde&quot;) is a town in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, the capital of Harz district. Located north of the Harz mountain range, it is known for its old town center, which was largely destroyed by Allied bombings in the late stages of World War II after local Nazi leaders refused to surrender. The town was rebuilt in the following decades.

In World War I Halberstadt was the site of a German military airbase and aircraft-manufacturing facilities. In World War II Halberstadt was a regional production center for Junkers aircraft, which also housed an SS forced labor camp. Halberstadt now includes the area where the Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp was situated.

Today the city has around 450 timber framed houses in its city centre and timber framed old villages like Langenstein.

== Geography ==

Halberstadt is situated between the Harz in the south and the Huy hills in the north on the Holtemme and Goldbach rivers, both left tributaries of the Bode. Halberstadt is the base of the Department of Public Management of the Hochschule Harz University of Applied Studies and Research.

The town center retains many important historic buildings and much of its ancient townscape. Notable places in Halberstadt include Halberstadt Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady (&quot;Liebfrauenkirche&quot;) and St Martin&#x27;s, churches built in the 12th and 13th centuries. Halberstadt is the site of the first documented large, permanent pipe organ installation in 1361. The cathedral is notable among those in northern European towns in having retained its medieval treasury in virtually complete condition. Among its treasures are the oldest surviving tapestries in Europe, dating from the 12th century. The town is also a stop on the scenic German Timber-Frame Road.

===Divisions===
The town of Halberstadt consists of Halberstadt proper and the following &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

==History==

In 814 the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious made the Christian mission in the German stem duchy of Saxony the episcopal see of the Diocese of Halberstadt. It was granted market rights by King Otto III in 989. The town became the administrative centre of the Saxon Harzgau and an important trading location. The Halberstadt bishops had the Church of Our Lady erected from about 1005 onwards. In his fierce conflict with Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the forces of the Saxon duke Henry the Lion devastated the town in 1179.

On Henry&#x27;s downfall, the Halberstadt diocese was elevated to a prince-bishopric about 1180. Its cathedral was rebuilt from 1236 and consecrated in 1491. Halberstadt, Quedlinburg and Aschersleben joined a league of towns (&quot;Halberstädter Dreistädtebund&quot;) in 1326; from 1387 the city was also a member of the Hanse.

From 1479 the diocese was administered by the Archbishops of Magdeburg. While the Halberstadt citizens turned Protestant around 1540, the cathedral chapter elected Prince Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel first Lutheran bishop in 1566. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the town was occupied by the troops of Albrecht von Wallenstein in 1629 and temporarily re-Catholicized according to the imperial Edict of Restitution. According to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia the prince-bishopric was finally secularized to the Principality of Halberstadt held by Brandenburg-Prussia. The first secular governor was Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal.

Halberstadt became part of the newly established Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. From 1747 Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim worked here as a government official and made his home an intellectual centre of the Enlightenment (&quot;Aufklärung&quot;) movement. Under the 1807 Treaty of Tilsit the town became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, a Napoleonic client-state and administrative seat of the Westphalian Department of Saale. On 29 July 1809 a Westphalian regiment was defeated by the Black Brunswickers under Prince Frederick William of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in the Battle of Halberstadt.

After the defeat of Napoleon the town was restored to Prussia and subsequently administered within the Province of Saxony. From 1815 Halberstadt was home to the Prussian 7th (Magdeburg) Cuirassiers &quot;von Seydlitz&quot; regiment, with Otto von Bismarck in the rank of an officer à la suite from 1868. The town&#x27;s economy was decisively promoted by the opening of the Magdeburg–Halberstadt Railway in 1843. The tramway was inaugurated in 1903. 

In 1912 the Halberstädter Flugzeugwerke aircraft manufacturer was founded followed by the opening of a military airbase, providing the German &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; in World War I. After the war it had to close down in accordance with the regulations of the Treaty of Versailles, until in the course of the German re-armament, it opened again in 1935 as a branch of the Junkers company in Dessau. The aircraft factory was the site of an &quot;SS&quot; forced labor camp, one of several subcamps of Buchenwald; the production facilities and the nearby &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airbase were targets of Allied bombing during the &#x27;Big Week&#x27; in February 1944.

In the last days of World War II, in April 1945, US forces approached Halberstadt as they attacked remaining Nazi troops in the short-lived Harz pocket. They dropped leaflets instructing Halberstadt&#x27;s Nazi ruler to fly a white flag on the town hall as a token of surrender. He refused, no white flag was raised and on 8 April 1945, 218 Flying Fortresses of the 8th Air Force, accompanied by 239 escort fighters, dropped 595 tons of bombs on the center of Halberstadt. This killed about 2,500 people and converted most of the old town into some 1.5 million cubic meters of rubble, which American troops briefly occupied three days later. Around 450 of 1600 timber framed houses survived in the city centre. By June 1945, the town and its garrison was handed over to the 3rd Shock Army of the Soviet Red Army forces.

Halberstadt was part of newly established Saxony-Anhalt from 1945 to 1952, after which it was within Bezirk Magdeburg in East Germany. During the Peaceful Revolution in Autumn 1989 St Martin&#x27;s Church was a centre of the Swords to ploughshares movement. After the reunification of Germany Halberstadt became part of the restored state of Saxony-Anhalt.

===Jewish culture===
Halberstadt&#x27;s Jewish community is mentioned in records from the 13th century and the town had a synagogue in 1464. In the early 18th century, Halberstadt had one of the largest Jewish communities in central Europe and was known as a center of theology and learning after Berend Lehmann (1661–1730) founded a beth midrash there in 1703. The building, called the&quot;Klaus&quot;, included a library and living quarters for scholars to study the Talmud. Lehmann also financed an impressive Baroque synagogue that was completed in 1712.

Halberstadt&#x27;s synagogue was ransacked and burned in the 9 November 1938 &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom. The synagogue&#x27;s Torah scrolls were removed and burned in the street. On 18 November 1938, the local building authority ordered the demolition of the synagogue and required the Jewish community to pay the cost of the work.

Today the Moses Mendelssohn Academy is based in the &quot;Klaus&quot;, providing exhibitions, presentations, and information about Jewish culture.

===One of the world&#x27;s slowest, longest &quot;concerts&quot;===

A performance of John Cage&#x27;s organ piece &quot;As Slow As Possible&quot; began in the Burchardikirche in Halberstadt in September 2001; the performance is scheduled to take 639 years. The concert began on 5 September 2001 with a rest lasting 17 months. On the dates of the sound changes the church is usually well visited.

<text>Georg Christoph Wagenseil (29 January 1715 – 1 March 1777) was an Austrian composer.

He was born in Vienna, and became a favorite pupil of the Vienna court&#x27;s 
Kapellmeister, Johann Joseph Fux. Wagenseil himself composed for the 
court from 1739 to his death. He also held positions as harpsichordist and 
organist. His pupils included Johann Baptist Schenk (who was to teach 
Ludwig van Beethoven), and Marie Antoinette. He traveled little, and died in Vienna having spent most of his life there.

Wagenseil was a well-known musical figure in his day — both Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are known to have been familiar with his works. His early works are Baroque, while his later pieces are in the Classical style. He composed a number of operas, choral works, symphonies, concertos, 
chamber music and keyboard pieces.

<text>Chromaffin cells, also called pheochromocytes (or phaeochromocytes), are neuroendocrine cells found mostly in the medulla of the adrenal glands in mammals. These cells serve a variety of functions such as serving as a response to stress, monitoring carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the body, maintenance of respiration and the regulation of blood pressure. They are in close proximity to pre-synaptic sympathetic ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system, with which they communicate, and structurally they are similar to post-synaptic sympathetic neurons. In order to activate chromaffin cells, the splanchnic nerve of the sympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine, which then binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the adrenal medulla. This causes the release of catecholamines. The chromaffin cells release catecholamines: ~80% of adrenaline (epinephrine) and ~20% of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) into systemic circulation for systemic effects on multiple organs (similarly to secretory neurones of the hypothalamus), and can also send paracrine signals. Hence they are called neuroendocrine cells.

==Embryonic origin and structure==
There are two types of cells that originate from the neural crest and are related to the sympathetic nervous system (originate from a cell called sympathogonia):
#Neuroblasts: These cells migrate, during the fourth to the fifth week of fetal development in humans, on both sides of the spinal cord toward the region just behind the dorsal aorta forming the two chains of sympathetic ganglia (Sympathetic chain). From these ganglia, the post synaptic sympathetic fibers will arise and extend toward their target organ. Some of these cells will migrate to the adrenal medulla to form sympathetic ganglia cells within the adrenal medulla (without postsynaptic sympathetic fibers). A tumor arising from these cells is called neuroblastoma.
#Chromaffin cells (or pheochromocytes): These cells will migrate to the area adjacent to the sympathetic ganglia (hence the name paraganglia) and to the adrenal medulla where they will be the most abundant type of cells. The largest extra-adrenal cluster of chromaffin cells in mammals is the organ of Zuckerkandl. Tumors arising from these cell are called paragangliomas or pheochromocytomas. These terms can be used interchangeably but usually paraganglioma refer to a tumor originating from chromaffin cells outside the adrenal gland, which can also be called extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma, whereas pheochromocytoma typically refer to a tumor originating from the chromaffin cells within the adrenal gland.

Chromaffin cells also settle near the vagus nerve and carotid arteries. In lower concentrations, extra-adrenal chromaffin cells also reside in the bladder wall, prostate, and behind the liver.

In non-mammals, chromaffin cells are found in a variety of places, generally not organised as an individual organ, and may be without innervation, relying only on endocrine or paracrine signals for secretion.

==Function==
Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are innervated by the splanchnic nerve and secrete adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), some dopamine, enkephalin and enkephalin-containing peptides, and a few other hormones into the blood stream. The secreted adrenaline and noradrenaline play an important role in the sympathetic nervous system response, commonly called the fight-or-flight response. The enkephalins and enkephalin-containing peptides are related to, but distinct from endogenous peptides named endorphins (which are secreted from the pituitary); all of these peptides bind to opioid receptors and produce analgesic (and other) responses. The hormones are secreted from chromaffin granules; this is where the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase catalyses the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline. Distinct N and E cell forms exist (also Na and A cells in British nomenclature - noradrenaline and adrenaline); the former produce norepinephrine, the latter arise out of N cells through interaction with glucocorticoids, and convert norepinephrine into epinephrine.

==Clinical significance==
Neoplasms arising from these cells are pheochromocytomas (also called chromaffin or sympathetic paragangliomas, in contrast to non-chromaffin or parasympathetic paragangliomas of glomus cells). Sometimes only neoplasms of adrenal origin are named pheochromocytomas, while others are named extra-adrenal paragangliomas.

=== Heart failure ===
Following heart failure, the body increases sympathetic activity to the adrenal medulla as the compensatory mechanism to increase heart rate and cardiac output. This increased sympathetic activity leads to chronically increased synthesis and secretion of catecholamines from the adrenal chromaffin cells. This chronic increase of epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion causes desensitization of the chromaffin cells to catecholamines resulting in a decrease in production and presence of α2 adrenergic receptors on their cell membrane. This desensitization and downregulation of α2 adrenergic receptors is caused by the upregulation of the enzyme Adrenal G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) which effectively eliminates the normal autocrine-type negative feedback that normally prevents the cells from over producing the catecholamines and replaces it with a positive feedback loop in which increased secretion further elicits more secretion. This upregulation of GRK2 is also accompanied by upregulation and increased production of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the rate limiting step of catecholamine synthesis.

==History==
:&quot;See also chromophil.&quot;
The word &quot;chromaffin&quot; comes from a portmanteau of &quot;chrom&quot;ium and &quot;affin&quot;ity. They are named as such because they can be visualised by staining with chromium salts. Chromium salts oxidise and polymerise catecholamines to form a brown color, most strongly in the cells secreting noradrenaline. Chromaffin cells are also called pheochromocytes.

The enterochromaffin cells are so named because of their histological similarity to chromaffin cells (they stain yellow when treated with chromium salts), but their function is quite different and they are not derivatives of the neural crest.

Paraganglia are clusters of either chromaffin cells or glomus cells near sympathetic ganglia.

The law deals with a great variety of subjects, such as tobacco price supports, railroads, private pension plans, emergency department treatment, disability insurance, and the postal service, but it is perhaps best known for Title X, which amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Public Health Service Act to deny income tax deductions to employers (generally those with 20 or more full-time equivalent employees) for contributions to a group health plan unless such plan meets certain continuing coverage requirements. The violation for failing to meet those criteria was subsequently changed to an excise tax.

Although this statute became law on April 7, 1986, its official name is the &quot;Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985&quot; (, ). Because of the discrepancy between the official name of the Act and the year in which it was enacted, some government publications refer to the Act as the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.

==Provisions==
As originally enacted, Title X of the Act provided that a qualifying employer will not be permitted to take a tax deduction for its health insurance costs unless its health insurance plan allows employees of the employer and the employee&#x27;s immediate family members who had been covered by a health care plan to maintain their coverage if a &quot;qualifying event&quot; causes them to lose coverage. However, the legislation was subsequently amended to instead impose an excise tax upon an employer whose health plan fails to satisfy the applicable rules. A qualifying employer is generally an employer with 20 or more full-time-equivalent employees.

Among the &quot;qualifying events&quot; listed in the statute are loss of benefits coverage due to (1) the death of the covered employee; (2) an employee loses eligibility for coverage due to voluntary or involuntary termination or a reduction in hours as a result of resignation, discharge (except for &quot;gross misconduct&quot;), layoff, strike or lockout, medical leave, or slowdown in business operations; (3) divorce or legal separation that terminates the ex-spouse&#x27;s eligibility for benefits; or (4) a dependent child reaching the age at which he or she is no longer covered. COBRA imposes different notice requirements on participants and beneficiaries, depending on the particular qualifying event that triggers COBRA rights. See DOL.GOV&#x27;s FAQs For Employers About COBRA Continuation Health Coverage

COBRA does not apply if coverage is lost because the employer has terminated the plan altogether or because the employer has gone out of business.

COBRA allows for coverage for up to 18 months in most cases. If the individual is deemed disabled by the Social Security Administration, coverage may continue for up to 29 months. In the case of divorce from the former employee, the former spouse&#x27;s coverage may continue for up to 36 months. In the case of death of the former employee, the widow&#x27;s coverage may continue for up to 36 months.

COBRA does not apply to businesses with fewer than twenty employees, but the majority of states have stepped in with state health insurance continuation laws, sometimes called &quot;mini-COBRA&quot; laws, which apply in these cases. Some of these are described below.

COBRA does not, unlike other federal statutes such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), require the employer to pay for the cost of providing continuation coverage. Instead it allows employees and their dependents to maintain coverage at their own expense by paying the full cost of the premium the employer and the employee previously paid, plus up to a 2% administrative charge (50% for the latter 11 months under the disability extension).

According to the U.S. Department of Labor:
Employees and dependents can also opt for a lesser form of coverage, e.g., to choose continuation coverage under a plan that only covers the employee, but not his or her dependents, or that only provides medical and hospitalization coverage and does not pay for dental work, if those options are available to covered employees.

Employees and dependents lose coverage if they fail to make timely payments of these premiums. Employers are required to inform employees and dependents upon loss of coverage, in writing, by at least fifteen days before the coverage ceases.

==Coordination of coverage==
An individual covered under COBRA may also be covered by another group health plan or Medicare as long as either of two conditions is met:
* The other coverage was in force as of or prior to the coverage under COBRA.
* The other coverage is subject to pre-existing conditions exclusions or limitations.
Under COBRA, the following individuals may be eligible for continuation coverage:

# Employees: Full-time and part-time employees who were covered by a group health plan sponsored by an employer with 20 or more employees. 
# Spouses: Spouses of covered employees who were enrolled in the group health plan.
# Dependent Children: Dependent children of covered employees who were enrolled in the group health plan.
# Qualified Beneficiaries: Individuals who were covered under the group health plan but lost coverage due to a qualifying event, such as the death of the covered employee, divorce or legal separation, a reduction in work hours, or the employee&#x27;s eligibility for Medicare.

COBRA coverage is typically temporary and individuals may be required to pay the full premium for the coverage, including the portion previously paid by the employer. The duration of COBRA coverage can vary depending on the specific qualifying event and the state in which the individual resides. Employers that provide COBRA qualified insurance are required to provide information about rights and coverage options to individuals eligible for coverage under the plan.

==Subsidy under federal stimulus==
Only 10% of Americans eligible for COBRA insurance in 2006 used it, many because they were unable to afford to pay the full premium after their job loss. While some employers may voluntarily help subsidize or fully cover the cost of COBRA insurance as part of a termination or exit package, it is more common for the ex-employee to cover the entire cost.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as signed by President Barack Obama includes a 65% subsidy to employees for COBRA-enabled insurance for up to 9 months after an involuntary termination (this has since been expanded to 15 months). An employee is eligible for this subsidy if
* the termination of employment was involuntary,
* the terminated employee has no other group sponsored health insurance option, and
* the terminated employee is otherwise eligible to enroll in COBRA.

If the employee has an adjusted gross income in 2009 over $125,000 if filing as single ($250,000 if filing jointly), then the subsidy will be recaptured in a phased manner from the employee through the tax system.

Termination of employment must have occurred between September 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 (later expanded to February 28, 2010, expanded again to March 31, 2010, and then expanded again to June 2, 2010). Specific provisions and responsibilities may differ in the state specific mini-COBRA plans for employers with fewer than 20 employees throughout half of the previous calendar year. Those employees who are eligible for the ultimate benefits of this subsidy are referred to as Assistance Eligible Individuals (or AEIs).

Employers subject to Federal COBRA are required to:
* Notify terminated employees of their potential rights under ARRA by sending a series of notices
* Provide a method for qualified AEIs to enroll
* Pay the full amount of the premiums and seek reimbursement of the 65% subsidy by including it in the Employer&#x27;s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941)

This Act was signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009.

On December 19, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010, which made several amendments to the COBRA provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The Act extends COBRA subsidy eligibility to employees who lost their jobs due to no fault of their own between January 1 and February 28, 2010. The nine-month subsidy period was also expanded to fifteen months.

On March 3, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Temporary Extension Act of 2010. The Act extends COBRA subsidy eligibility to employees who lost their jobs due to no fault of their own between March 1 and 31, 2010. In addition, employees who lost group health insurance due to reduced work hours on or after Sept. 1, 2008, followed by involuntary termination between March 2 and March 31, 2010, will now be eligible for the COBRA subsidy.

The Continuing Extension Act of 2010 extends premium assistance for COBRA benefits through May 31, 2010.

As of June 2010, an extension of COBRA&#x27;s premium assistance has not materialized, and attempts by congressional members to include such provisions have been dropped. As of June 1, 2010, all newly unemployed workers must pay full coverage costs as determined by their respective plans. This is due in part to conservative Democrats in Congress who have expressed concerns about treating some unemployed workers differently from others, such as people priced out of the private insurance market. A number of Senate Democrats expressed concern about this situation and have introduced legislation to expand COBRA coverage to people who become unemployed through November 2010, but such legislation did not pass in 2010.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 included a provision to fully cover COBRA premiums from April through September 2021.

==Similar state and local legislation==
Forty-one states have legislation similar to federal COBRA requiring employers to allow employees and their dependents to continue their group health insurance coverage following certain qualifying events. The District of Columbia also has laws covering COBRA.

===California===
California&#x27;s legislation applies to non-government employers with a group health insurance plan with fewer than twenty employees.

===District of Columbia===
The District of Columbia&#x27;s Continuation of Health Coverage Act of 2001 applies to employers with a group health insurance plan with a situs in the District of Columbia and with fewer than twenty employees. Coverage must be offered to be extended for a period of three months following the date that coverage would have ended.

===Maryland===
Maryland&#x27;s legislation only applies to employers with a group health insurance plan with a situs in Maryland and with fewer than twenty employees that continuation coverage must be offered to an employee who lives in Maryland, who had coverage from the employer for at least three months, and who either resigns or loses employment due to no fault of their own. Continuation coverage must also be offered to the former spouse and dependent children of an employee after a divorce. One exception to the eighteen-month rule is that coverage may end for the former spouse upon the former spouse&#x27;s remarriage. Continuation coverage must also be offered to the surviving spouse and dependent children of an employee who dies. The employee must have resided in Maryland and had coverage with the employer for at least three months prior to death. In all cases, continuation coverage must be offered for eighteen months, with the exception that a former spouse&#x27;s continuation coverage ends upon remarriage.

===Virginia===
Virginia&#x27;s legislation applies to employers with a group health insurance plan, other than an HMO plan, and with twenty or fewer employees. Employers must offer continuation coverage to employees for twelve months. The legislation does not apply to employees who did not have coverage from the employer for at least three months prior to the qualifying event.

<doc id="582942" wikidata="Q89673816" url="?curid=582942" title="Pokémon Center">
<text>The Pokémon Center is a chain of specialty stores selling &quot;Pokémon&quot;-related merchandise. Pokémon Centers are predominantly located in Japan, the first having opened in Tokyo in 1998. Stores have also opened in Singapore, the United States, and Taiwan.

Within the &quot;Pokémon&quot; universe, &quot;Pokémon Centers&quot; are locations where characters can heal, manage, and trade their Pokémon creatures. Real Pokémon Centers, named after the fictional counterparts, sell merchandise such as action figures, plush toys, cereal boxes, clothing, backpacks, and badges.

==History==
The Pokémon Company opened the first Pokémon Center store in Tokyo in April 1998. This original Pokémon Center eventually closed and reopened in a different location. Pokémon Center Osaka, one of the franchise&#x27; bigger locations at 830 square meters, was the country&#x27;s seventh Pokémon Center and opened in 2010. 

On November 16, 2001, Nintendo opened a store called the Pokémon Center in Rockefeller Center, New York City. The Pokémon Center was closed and replaced by the Nintendo World Store in 2005. This store was renovated and rebranded to Nintendo New York in 2016.

Only four Pokémon Centers remained open at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, and the location in Okayama closed permanently. There are over 20 Pokémon Center locations in Japan as of 2023.

On 8th December 2023, the second permanent Pokémon Center outside of Japan opened in Taipei at the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store near Taipei 101. The Pokémon Company International launched an online Pokémon Center store in 2014.

<doc id="582944" wikidata="Q2164974" url="?curid=582944" title="The Suicide Machines">
<text>The Suicide Machines are an American punk rock band formed in March 1991 in Detroit, Michigan. During the course of their career, the band has released seven full-length albums on the labels Hollywood Records, Side One Dummy Records and Fat Wreck Chords, as well as several EPs and singles. They have experienced lineup changes over the years, all with founding member Jason Navarro as lead singer and front man. The contemporary lineup includes Ryan Vandeberghe on drums, Rich Tschirhart on bass and Justin Malek on guitar.

The band&#x27;s musical style initially blended elements of punk rock, ska, and hardcore into genres popularly known as ska punk and ska-core, which characterized their first two albums. After a brief foray in a more radio friendly direction, they shifted back towards their mid-1990s style, bringing back ska punk, as well as a heavier ferocity with strong political overtones that draws from early hardcore punk. 

The Suicide Machines have achieved a high level of underground recognition through relentless touring, including multiple performances on the Warped Tour, Riot Fest and for many years their annual hometown Black Christmas festivals. 

In 2019, the band entered Marc Jacob Hudson&#x27;s Rancho Recordo, with producer Roger Lima of Less Than Jake to record a new full-length album, &quot;Revolution Spring&quot;. The album was released March 27, 2020, via Fat Wreck Chords. A music video, &quot;To Play Caesar (Is To Be Stabbed To Death)&quot; from the &quot;Revolution Spring&quot; album was released in 2020 as well. 

In 2022, the band released a split 12&quot; with Japanese band Coquettish titled &quot;Gebo Gomi&quot; on Bad Time Records.
==Band history==
===1991-1995: Jack Kevorkian and the Suicide Machines===
The Suicide Machines formed in 1991 in Detroit, Michigan, under the original name Jack Kevorkian and the Suicide Machines. The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Jason Navarro on vocals, Dan Lukacinsky on guitar, Jason Brake on bass guitar, and Stefan Rairigh on drums] This lineup lasted a year until Bill Jennings replaced Rairigh, but he was soon replaced by Derek Grant. They recorded the band&#x27;s first demos &quot;The Essential Kevorkian&quot; and &quot;Green World&quot; in 1993 and 1994, both released through their own label Sluggo&#x27;s Old Skool Records. They also released the &quot;Vans Song&quot; 7-inch single on Youth Rendition Records. Brake left the group in 1994 and was briefly replaced by Dave Smith until Royce Nunley joined on bass. The lineup of Navarro, Lukacinsky, Nunley, and Grant would last for the next four years. This lineup reduced the band&#x27;s name to the Suicide Machines and recorded the &quot;Skank for Brains&quot; split album with the Rudiments.

===1996-2001: Hollywood Records years===
In 1995 the band signed to Hollywood Records. 1996 saw the release of their first album, &quot;Destruction by Definition&quot;. Its blend of punk rock and ska brought them national attention in the midst of the mid-1990s punk rock mainstream revival. The single &quot;No Face&quot; became a minor hit on modern rock radio stations and the album was supported through extensive touring across the United States. They released a follow-up in 1998 titled &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;, which continued their ska punk style while incorporating more aggressive elements of hardcore punk and sociopolitical lyrics, with nearly all of its songs lasting under two minutes in length.

Following the release of &quot;Battle Hymns&quot; Grant left the band. He went on to play with numerous groups including Thoughts of Ionesco, the Vandals, Face to Face, and Telegraph before finding a permanent position in the Alkaline Trio. He was replaced by Erin Pitman for some touring before new permanent drummer Ryan Vandeberghe joined. In 2000 this lineup released &quot;The Suicide Machines&quot;, a more hard rock–oriented effort that moved away from the ska influences of their earlier releases. They received some radio and video play for the single &quot;Sometimes I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; and performed on the Warped Tour that summer. In 2001 they released &quot;Steal This Record&quot;, which continued their exploration of pop punk style while mixing in elements of their earlier ska punk and hardcore albums.

===2002-2005: Side One Dummy Records years===
Following touring in support of &quot;Steal This Record&quot; bassist Nunley left the Suicide Machines to start his own band, Blueprint 76, and was replaced by Rich Tschirhart. The band also ended their contract with Hollywood Records, fulfilling their contractual obligations by releasing the compilation album &quot;The Least Worst of the Suicide Machines&quot;. They then moved to the independent label Side One Dummy Records. Their next album &quot;A Match and Some Gasoline&quot;, released in 2003, found the band abandoning the pop experimentations of their previous two albums and returning more to the ska punk and hardcore styles of their earlier years. They also continued exploring sociopolitical themes in songs such as &quot;Did You Ever Get a Feeling of Dread?&quot; and &quot;Your Silence,&quot; which were critical of President George W. Bush&#x27;s administration, its response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They toured internationally in support of the album and again performed on the Warped Tour.

In 2005 the band released the album &quot;War Profiteering is Killing Us All&quot;, which continued their political themes by openly attacking the Bush White House, the continuation of the Iraq War, and conservative Republicanism. Navarro also launched his own record label, Noise Riot Records, and released &quot;On the Eve of Destruction: 1991-1995&quot;, a compilation of the band&#x27;s early EPs, singles, and demos.

===2006-2008: Breakup, post-Suicide Machines activity and reformation===
In 2006, while touring in support of &quot;War Profiteering is Killing Us All&quot;, the band abruptly broke up. Explanations given by the band members for this included Vandeberghe&#x27;s desire to take a break from touring, which he did while friend Steve McCrumb filled for a performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on May 11. A tour of Mexico had been planned to follow this, and Navarro had suggested that the band perform its final shows that Christmas. However, interpersonal tensions came to a head after the Troubadour show when Lukacinsky refused to finish the tour. Lukacinsky himself further elaborated that the band had been planning to break up for some time.

Following the band&#x27;s breakup Navarro and Vandeberghe continued working with Left in Ruin, a band they had started as a Suicide Machines side project and had worked on and off with for almost 6 years. Vandeberghe also joined the new band Hifi Handgrenades, and Tschirhart joined the band soon after. Later, Tschirhart formed another band called the A-Gang with former Mest drummer Nick Gigler. Lukacinsky, meanwhile, started his own band Bayonetting the Wounded, who broke up after a few demo recordings. He then moved to Japan and formed the One Thought Moment. Early in 2008, Navarro formed another Detroit band, Hellmouth, in which he was back on lead vocals. In 2011, Navarro formed a new band called Break Anchor.
Bassist Rich Tschirhart also went on to form Bastardous with former Mest drummer, Nick Gigler. 
In 2013, drummer Ryan Vandeberghe teamed up with current and former members of Telegraph, Hellmouth, Hifi Handgrenades, ForDireLifeSake, and others to form the band Rebel Spies.

The Suicide Machines as a band were dormant for 3 years. Always willing to play benefits for various social activist causes, they reunited in 2009.

===2009-2019: Reformation and Return===
In late 2009, the Suicide Machines, with Hellmouth drummer Justin Malek replacing Lukacinsky on guitar, reformed for a benefit concert in Detroit.

On July 24, 2010, the Suicide Machines performed at St. Andrews Hall in Detroit. In October, the Suicide Machines performed at The Fest 9. On October 8, 2011, the Suicide Machines played Riot Fest 2011 in Chicago, as well as further shows throughout 2011.

The Suicide Machines played shows in Rochester, NY on May 19, followed by a performance at Pouzza Fest 2012, which took place May 18–20 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Throughout 2012, 2013, and 2014, the band continued to play shows around the U.S., including their annual Black Christmas fests that they headline in their native Detroit each December.

On August 16, 2014, the Suicide Machines headlined with Lower Class Brats, Suburban Legends and Morning Glory for the Summergrind 2014 show in Denver, Colorado.

In April 2015, the band embarked on a two-week tour of the midwestern and east coast United States with former drummer Derek Grant, performing their 1996 album, &#x27;Destruction By Definition&#x27;, in its entirety at all shows.

The band played the Vans Warped Tour that summer for four dates: Cuyahoga Falls, Cincinnati, Noblesville, and Auburn Hills. On May 18, 2017, it was announced that the Suicide Machines would be headlining the New Generation of Ska Festival in Seoul, South Korea on August 19.

The band played a show with the Code on May 25, 2018, in Lawrenceville, PA and announced that they were working on new material, and would return with a new record. They performed some of the new songs at Black Christmas in Detroit in December 2018. The band played local shows throughout the year and occasionally did short tours and one-off shows overseas.
The band&#x27;s final live performance before the global pandemic shutdown was a benefit for the charity Food Not Class in January 2020.

===Black Christmas shows 2013-2019===

<doc id="582946" wikidata="Q2565432" url="?curid=582946" title="In This Skin">
<text>In This Skin is the third studio album by American recording artist Jessica Simpson. The album was released on August 19, 2003, by Columbia Records. It was reissued on March 2, 2004, with three new songs. Simpson began taking more creative control of her music with the album, both musically and lyrically, co-writing 10 out of 14 tracks on the album, thus moving away from the teen pop styles of her previous two albums, &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; (1999) and &quot;Irresistible&quot; (2001), as well as including elements of Middle Eastern music, dance, acoustic, and pop rock, while also lyrically talking about more mature subject matters. The album was a huge success in North America, reaching number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and being certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Internationally, &quot;In This Skin&quot; went on to become the thirty-fifth best selling album of 2004. It was ranked number 153 on the list of the top-selling albums of the 2000s by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. As of 2020, &quot;In This Skin&quot; has sold 7 million copies worldwide.

The album spawned four singles, including two top 20 hits worldwide, &quot;With You&quot; and &quot;Take My Breath Away,&quot; which peaked at number fourteen and twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 respectively. &quot;Sweetest Sin&quot; and &quot;Angels,&quot; the lead and final single, both failed to make an impact on charts. Simpson performed songs from &quot;In This Skin&quot; on a number of occasions. In middle 2004, she embarked on her second headlining tour, titled the Reality Tour, to promote the album.

==Background==
After the release of her 2001 album &quot;Irresistible&quot;, Simpson stated she wanted to write songs for her third record. In an interview with MTV in October 2002, her then-husband, Nick Lachey, revealed that Simpson was in the studio, working on a new record. Lachey said, &quot;She&#x27;s finally writing her own music, which I&#x27;ve told her she could do forever but she&#x27;s been shy about stepping out there and doing it. But she&#x27;s an incredible writer, and she&#x27;s doing stuff that&#x27;s really from the heart.&quot; About the album&#x27;s sound, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s a much more organic record and it&#x27;s more true to herself ... There&#x27;s all live instrumentation and it&#x27;s very musical as opposed to the pop thing that was happening before for her. I think she finally feels like this is her record and her chance to do exactly what she wants.&quot; In March 2003, Simpson revealed that her third album would be called &quot;In This Skin&quot;.

==Production and development==
Simpson said in an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;I wanted to make a romantic, organic album, there are songs that say something that I hope will move or inspire people.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Chuck Taylor compared the record to her first album, saying, &quot;Simpson&#x27;s soaring vocals give &#x27;In This Skin&#x27; a smooth touch, as it sways between spirited midtempo melodies and her signature ballads.&quot;

Originally, the album was planned to be primarily produced by American rapper Missy Elliott, while the sole featured appearance was to be made by Nick Lachey. However, the pair&#x27;s contributions never made the final cut of the album. About the recording process, Simpson said that A&amp;R executive Teresa LaBarbera Whites &quot;had the incredible idea of creating a songwriting camp. I would go from room to room with one songwriter after another... We would sit there for two or three hours—write an entire song—and then go in and record it in 90 minutes. It was so refreshing.&quot; Much of the album was recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles, with the help of established writers and producers.
&quot;Sweetest Sin,&quot; the album&#x27;s first single, was written by Diane Warren and is about losing one&#x27;s virginity. MTV described the song as a &quot;sweet track.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Simpson said the song was &quot;nothing negative, it&#x27;s all about love.&quot; About the second single, &quot;With You,&quot; Simpson said, &quot;It&#x27;s cool for me just because it&#x27;s my personality ... Nick loves me with nothing but a T-shirt on so that&#x27;s where the song idea came from.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; cited &quot;I Have Loved You&quot; and &quot;Underneath&quot; as the most expressive tracks from the album, citing the latter as &quot;a four-month period where Simpson and Lachey called it quits, then-in the wake of Sep. 11, 2001 ... realized the value of making a relationship work.&quot; The magazine described the title track as &quot;a plucky pop anthem about self-acceptance.&quot; About the song, Simpson said, &quot;I was 102 pounds and people at the record label were telling me that I needed to lose weight. The song is saying that I am worthy to feel beautiful in my skin. It&#x27;s something that every woman experiences in one way or another.&quot;

The album was subsequently reissued with three new recordings: an acoustic version of &quot;With You&quot; and two covers. The Berlin cover &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; is Simpson and Lachey&#x27;s love theme, she said, &quot;because it was playing the first time Nick kissed me.&quot; Simpson also said that she had &quot;been obsessed with &#x27;Take My Breath Away&#x27; for a very long time.&quot; Another cover on the album was Robbie Williams&#x27; &quot;Angels.&quot; Simpson described the recording session for the two songs as difficult because she had to do both songs in one day. Lachey helped produce the vocals for both songs, and Simpson credited him with helping her get in the right mood by keeping his hand in her back pocket &quot;and being right there&quot; during the recording session.

==Critical reception==

Initial critical response to &quot;In This Skin&quot; was mixed. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the album 2.5 stars and criticized it as &quot;glossy, ever-so-slightly over-produced ... weighed down by soggy, overwrought pop ballads&quot; and &quot;sickeningly sweet&quot; lyrics. However, he praised &quot;Forbidden Fruit,&quot; comparing it to Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;Music,&quot; and &quot;Loving You,&quot; which he described as &quot;a seductively contrived reminder that, with teen pop long dead, Simpson should be aiming to recapture the club audience that helped launch her career with &#x27;I Wanna Love You Forever.&#x27;&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic also gave the album 2.5 stars in a mixed review, writing, &quot;The problem with &quot;In This Skin&quot; is that its heart is in the mature middle of the road but its sound is still pitched too young, making [it] a record that satisfies neither audience.&quot;

Jon Caramanica of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 2 stars, criticizing Simpson&#x27;s lack of vocal &quot;subtlety.&quot; However, he added, &quot;Her powerful voice is done a disservice by insipid songwriting and arrangements — as on the loathsome club track &#x27;Forbidden Fruit&#x27; and the uncomfortably stately ballad &#x27;You Don&#x27;t Have to Let Go&#x27; — that consistently get in the way of her pipes.&quot;

&quot;In This Skin&quot; debuted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart with 64,000 copies sold. Within five months of release, the album had sold 565,000 copies. In March 2004, the album was re-released and it jumped from number 16 to number two, selling 160,000 copies in that week and seeing a 205% increase in sales.

==Singles==
&quot;Sweetest Sin&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;In This Skin&quot;. The music video, directed by Dean Paraskavopoulos, starts with black-and-white shots of Simpson dancing and looking at viewers. It cuts to Simpson swaying on a beach, and embracing Nick Lachey underneath a waterfall on the beach. Further scenes are presented, such as one in which Simpson lies on a bed by herself. The video continues with intercut footage of the previous scenes, until the final seconds of the song, when Simpson is joined by her husband, in which they move on their bed on the beach. The video ends when Lachey disappears, leaving the singer alone. &quot;With You&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on September 16, 2003. The song received positive reviews from critics, and enjoyed more success, reaching at top ten on Australia and UK and top-twenty on Ireland, Norway and United States. The single was her first number one in Top 40 Mainstream chart. Later was certified Gold in US and Platinum on Australia. The video of the song was released as a DVD single. Simpson received one and only MTV Europe Music Award nomination for Best Female, enjoying her commercial success outside America. It received two MTV Video Music Award nominations for Best Female Video and Best Pop Video. &quot;I Have Loved You&quot; peaked at number one on Paraguay Charts.

==Promotion==
Simpson performed &quot;Sweetest Sin&quot; live at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The performance, dedicated to Lachey, was recorded and later broadcast on the second season of &quot;Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica&quot;. &quot;With You&quot; was also performed on American late-night show &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and American morning show &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; on October 17 and October 23, 2003. She also gave a memorable performance of &quot;With You&quot;/&quot;Angels&quot; at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The promotion of &quot;Angels&quot; by Simpson was extensive; she sang a Spanglish duet of the song with Spanish singer David Bisbal at the 2004 Latin Grammy Awards, performed it on &quot;VH1 Divas 2004&quot; and on shows like &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Early Show&quot;. She later performed it during the seventh season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

===The Reality Tour===
The Reality Tour to promote &quot;In This Skin&quot; was the second concert tour by Jessica Simpson. While promoting the re-release of her album, Simpson stated in several interviews the possibility of a tour, wanting to break away from filming her TV series and connect with her fans. The tour was officially announced in May 2004 through various media outlets, with sponsorship from Ice Breakers and Proactiv Solution.

During an interview with the Associated Press, the singer said she wanted the concerts to focus on her music and her personality. Onstage, Simpson was joined by a seven-piece band, with no dancers or choreography for the show. Simpson would perform songs from her three current albums, while providing anecdotes about her life and the songs. Unseen footage from her and variety show (titled &quot;The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour&quot;) were included in the show as well. Each night, the singer dedicated &quot;I Have Loved You&quot; to the American armed forces and conducted a Q&amp;A session with contest winners.
Before the tour commenced, Simpson performed at several radio-sponsored music festivals including Your Show, Wango Tango, Summer Music Mania, Zootopia, Kiss Concert, and Play Safe in the Park.

The tour began in Chula Vista in May, visiting over 50 cities, ending in West Springfield. Despite early reports of poor ticket sales, Simpson&#x27;s tour became one of the biggest summer tours in North America, prompting the singer to add more shows in the U.S. The tour ranked number 86 on Pollstar&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Tours 2004&quot;, earning over seven million dollars.

<doc id="582950" wikidata="Q287004" url="?curid=582950" title="Black Act 1723">
<text>The Act 9 Geo. 1. c. 22, commonly known as the Black Act, or the Waltham Black Act, and sometimes called the Black Act 1722, the Black Act 1723, the Waltham Black Act 1722, the Criminal Law Act 1722, or the Criminal Law Act 1723, was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. It was passed in 1723 in response to a series of raids against landowners by two groups of poachers, known as the Blacks from their habit of blacking their faces when they undertook the raids. The Act was expanded over the years and greatly strengthened the criminal law by specifying over 200 capital crimes, many with intensified punishment. Arson, for example, had its definition expanded to include the new crime of burning (or threatening to burn) haystacks.

The legal rights of suspects and defendants under this Act were strictly limited. For example, suspects who did not surrender within 40 days could be summarily judged guilty and sentenced to execution, so that if they were apprehended at a later date they could be executed without delay. Villages were punished if they failed to find, prosecute and convict alleged criminals.

The Act originated in the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble collapse and the ensuing economic downturn. The Blacks quickly demonstrated both &quot;a calculated programme of action, and a conscious social resentment&quot;, and their activities led to the introduction of the Black Act to Parliament on 26 April 1723. The Act came into force on 27 May and introduced the death penalty for over 350 criminal offences, including being found disguised in a forest and carrying a weapon; &quot;no other single statute passed during the eighteenth century equalled [the Black Act] in severity, and none appointed the punishment of death in so many cases&quot;. A criminal law reform campaign in the early 19th century caused it to be largely repealed on 8 July 1823, when a reform bill introduced by Robert Peel came into force.

The Building Act 1774, which imposed restrictions on exterior decoration, was also known as the Black Act.

==Background==

Following the 1720 South Sea Bubble collapse, Britain suffered an economic downturn that led to heightened social tensions. A small element of the social unrest was the activity of two groups of poachers that were based in Hampshire and Windsor Forest respectively. The first flurry of activity came from the Hampshire group and began in October 1721 when 16 poachers assembled in Farnham to raid the park of the Bishop of Winchester. Three deer were carried off and two others killed. Four of the poachers were later caught, with two released for lack of evidence and the others pilloried and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. The poachers became known as the &quot;Blacks&quot;, because of their practice of blackening their faces to prevent identification; most famously, a Hampshire group became known as the &quot;Waltham Blacks&quot;. After the convictions, the poachers decided to attack the Bishop&#x27;s property again, which demonstrated &quot;a calculated programme of action, and a conscious social resentment&quot; that distinguished them from normal poachers. In reprisal for the earlier arrests and sentences, they took 11 deer and killed many more, which led to a royal proclamation offering for information that led to the arrest of the gang.

More raids followed, highlighting a &quot;fairly direct class hatred&quot;, culminating in the raid of a shipment of wine ordered for Frederick, Prince of Wales. That proved to be the final straw, with Sir Francis Page, a &quot;notorious hanging judge&quot;, sent to the Winchester Assizes to preside over any prosecutions; this forced the Hampshire Blacks underground. The Windsor Blacks then began their activities, copying the Hampshire group. Their main target was Caversham Park, owned by the Earl of Cadogan, with a series of increasingly-audacious raids in 1722 and 1723, including one in which a gamekeeper&#x27;s son was killed. As a response to the apparent spread of purposeful and organized raids by groups of poachers, the government introduced the Black Act, formally &quot;An Act for the more effectual punishing wicked and evil disposed Persons going armed in Disguise and doing Injuries and Violence to the Persons and Properties of His Majesty&#x27;s Subjects, and for the more speedy bringing the Offenders to Justice&quot;, to Parliament on 26 April 1723. It came into force on 27 May.

At the time, it was thought that the Blacks were Jacobites, and Sir Robert Walpole encouraged the spread of that idea to advance his own interests. The rationale for the Act has been described as &quot;at least as much to do with the hysteria induced by Walpole ... as with any need for new powers to fight deer-stealing&quot;.

In March 1723, Philip Caryll was arrested by the government for drinking to the Old Pretender&#x27;s health in the home of the latter&#x27;s former nurse in Portsea, Portsmouth. An innkeeper of Horndean testified that Caryll held meetings at his inn with the former Tory MP Sir Henry Goring, who fled to France after the Jacobite Atterbury Plot had been discovered in August 1722. It quickly became known to the Dutch ambassador that Goring had requested the Waltham Blacks&#x27; support for a Jacobite rising. The ambassador wrote that the Blacks were originally a group of smugglers and that their Jacobite allegiance was the primary reason for the passing of the Black Act. Goring wrote to the Pretender on 6 May 1723:

==Act==
The Act dealt with any offender who was armed and with a blacked face, armed and otherwise disguised, merely blacked, merely disguised, accessories after the fact or &quot;any other person or persons&quot;. Anyone in one of the above categories found in a forest, chase, down or Royal Park could be sentenced to death. Similarly, it was an offence to hunt, kill, wound or steal deer in those locations, with the first offence punishable by a fine and the second by penal transportation. Other criminalised activities included fishing, the hunting of hares, the destruction of fish-ponds, the destruction of trees and the killing of cattle in those locations, the last of which also punishable by death. An offender could also be executed for setting fire to corn, hay, straw, wood, houses or barns or shooting another person. The same penalties applied to attempting to rescue anyone imprisoned under the Black Act or attempting to solicit other people to participate in crimes that violated it. In total, the Act introduced the death penalty for over 350 criminal acts.

==Aftermath==
Three of the Blacks&#x27; leaders had already been captured during the passage of the Act although one later escaped, and a series of government raids captured a total of 32 Blacks who were tried after the Act&#x27;s passage in Reading. Four were sentenced to death for the killing of the gamekeeper&#x27;s son, and were executed on 15 June 1723. Trials for the others continued into 1724, and seven more were captured and tried on 7 December. That marked the effective end of the Blacks as an organised group.

As late as the Jacobite rising of 1745–46, newspapers reported that the Blacks had reappeared in Hampshire, where they had stolen deer and robbed parks.

Modern scholars have differed in their view of whether the Blacks were Jacobites. Some argue that the links between the Blacks and the Jacobites were &quot;fantasies&quot; and that the Blacks were &quot;simply a mixed group of foresters: labourers, yeomen and some gentry defending their customary rights&quot;. Others, however, have claimed that the Blacks were closely connected with Jacobitism and that the Black Act was designed to combat that political threat. Sir Geoffrey Elton claimed that the Act was &quot;passed not in order to suppress legitimate protest but because organized gangs were destroying deer and planning a Jacobite rising&quot;.

The Act has been described as &quot;severe and sanguinary&quot;, and L. Radzinowicz noted in the &quot;Cambridge Law Journal&quot; that &quot;no other single statute passed during the eighteenth century equalled [the Black Act] in severity, and none appointed the punishment of death in so many cases&quot;. Efforts to repeal it started in 1810, with comments by William Grant as part of a wider debate on penal reform. A formal recommendation for its repeal took almost a decade to appear, with the publication of the &quot;Report on Criminal Laws&quot; in 1819 that marked the first &quot;official&quot; suggestion that the law be removed from the statute books. Following the publication of that &quot;Report&quot;, Sir James Mackintosh introduced a law reform bill that would have repealed the Act, but although it passed through the House of Commons, it was strongly opposed in the House of Lords. In 1823, he submitted a memo to the House of Commons, again to suggest the repeal of the Act, and a few months later, Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, introduced a bill to repeal most of the Black Act, while maintaining the parts that criminalised setting fire to houses and shooting a person. That repeal passed and came into effect on 8 July 1823. The Black Act was entirely repealed by the Criminal Statutes Repeal Act 1827.

<text>Zhangzhung or Shangshung was an ancient kingdom in western and northwestern Tibet, existing from about 500 BCE to 625 CE, pre-dating Tibetan Buddhism. The Zhangzhung culture is associated with the Bon religion, which has influenced the philosophies and practices of Tibetan Buddhism. Zhangzhung people are mentioned frequently in ancient Tibetan texts as the original rulers of today&#x27;s western Tibet. Only in the last two decades have archaeologists been given access to do field work in the areas once ruled by the Zhangzhung.

==Extent==
Tradition has it that Zhangzhung consisted &quot;of three different regions: sGob-ba, the outer; Phug-pa, the inner; and Bar-ba, the middle. The outer is what we might call Western Tibet, from Gilgit in the west to Dangs-ra khyung-rdzong in the east, next to lake gNam-mtsho, and from Khotan in the north to Chu-mig brgyad-cu rtsa-gnyis in the south. Ladakh, including Lahaul and Spiti, was part of sGob-ba. The inner region is said to be sTag-gzig (Tazig) [often identified with Bactria], and the middle rGya-mkhar bar-chod, a place not yet identified.&quot; While it is not certain whether Zhangzhung was really so large, it was an independent kingdom and covered the whole of what is today&#x27;s Western Tibet, Ladakh and Gilgit.

The capital city of Zhangzhung was called Khyunglung ( or ), the &quot;Silver Palace of Garuda&quot;, southwest of Mount Kailash (Mount Ti-se), which is identified with palaces found in the upper Sutlej Valley.

According to Rolf Alfred Stein, author of &quot;Tibetan Civilization&quot;, the area of Shang Shung was not historically a part of Tibet and was a distinctly foreign territory to the Tibetans: 
==History==

===Possible Iron Age culture===
Archeological work on the Chang Tang plateau in 2010 found possible evidence of an Iron Age culture in the area which some have tentatively identified as that of the Zhangzhung.

===Conquest of Zhangzhung===
There is some confusion as to whether Central Tibet conquered Zhangzhung during the reign of Songtsen Gampo (605 or 617–649) or in the reign of Trisong Detsen (), (r. 755 until 797 or 804). The records of the &quot;Tang Annals&quot; do, however, seem to clearly place these events in the reign of Songtsen Gampo for they say that in 634, Yangtong (Zhangzhung) and various Qiang tribes, &quot;altogether submitted to him&quot;. Following this he united with the country of Yangtong to defeat the &#x27;Azha or Tuyuhun, and then conquered two more tribes of Qiang before threatening Songzhou with an army of more than 200,000 men. He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and, when refused, attacked Songzhou. He apparently finally retreated and apologised and later the emperor granted his request.

Early Tibetan accounts say that the Tibetan king and the king of Zhangzhung had married each other&#x27;s sisters in a political alliance. However, the Tibetan wife of the king of the Zhangzhung complained of poor treatment by the king&#x27;s principal wife. War ensued, and through the treachery of the Tibetan princess, &quot;King Ligmikya of Zhangzhung, while on his way to &quot;Sum-ba&quot; (Amdo province) was ambushed and killed by King Srongtsen Gampo&#x27;s soldiers. As a consequence, Zhangzhung was annexed to Bod (Central Tibet). Thereafter the new kingdom born of the unification of Zhangzhung and Bod was known as Bod rGyal-khab.&quot; R. A. Stein places the conquest of Zhangzhung in 645.

===677 revolt===
Zhangzhung revolted soon after the death of King Mangsong Mangtsen or Trimang Löntsän (, r. 650–677), the son of Songtsen Gampo, but was brought back under Tibetan control by the &quot;firm governance of the great leaders of the Mgar clan&quot;.

==Zhangzhung language==
A handful of Zhangzhung texts and 11th century bilingual Tibetan documents attest to a Zhang-Zhung language which was related to Kinnauri. The Bonpo claim that the Tibetan writing system is derived from the Zhangzhung alphabet, while modern scholars recognise the clear derivation of Tibetan script from a North Indian script, which accords with non-Bon Tibetan accounts. 
A modern Kinnauri language called by the same name (pronounced locally Jangshung) is spoken by 2,000 people in the Sutlej Valley of Himachal Pradesh who claim to be descendants of the Zhangzhung.

==Cultural legacy==
Bonpo tradition claims that Bon was founded by a Buddha named Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche, to whom are ascribed teachings similar in scope to those ascribed to the historical Gautama Buddha. Bonpos claim that Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche lived some 18,000 years ago, and visited Tibet from the land of Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring, or Shambhala.
Bonpos also suggest that during this time Lord Shenrab Miwoche&#x27;s teaching permeated the entire subcontinent and was in part responsible for the development of the Vedic religion. An example of this link is said to be Mount Kailash, which is the center of Zhangzhung culture, and also the most sacred mountain to Hindus. As a result, the Bonpos claim that the supposedly much later Hindu teaching owes its origin – at least indirectly – to Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche.

<doc id="582968" wikidata="Q373597" url="?curid=582968" title="Hematuria">
<text>Hematuria or haematuria is defined as the presence of blood or red blood cells in the urine. &quot;Gross hematuria&quot; occurs when urine appears red, brown, or tea-colored due to the presence of blood. Hematuria may also be subtle and only detectable with a microscope or laboratory test. Blood that enters and mixes with the urine can come from any location within the urinary system, including the kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra, and in men, the prostate. Common causes of hematuria include urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, viral illness, trauma, bladder cancer, and exercise. These causes are grouped into glomerular and non-glomerular causes, depending on the involvement of the glomerulus of the kidney. But not all red urine is hematuria. Other substances such as certain medications and foods (e.g. blackberries, beets, food dyes) can cause urine to appear red. Menstruation in women may also cause the appearance of hematuria and may result in a positive urine dipstick test for hematuria. A urine dipstick test may also give an incorrect positive result for hematuria if there are other substances in the urine such as myoglobin, a protein excreted into urine during rhabdomyolysis. A positive urine dipstick test should be confirmed with microscopy, where hematuria is defined by three or more red blood cells per high power field. When hematuria is detected, a thorough history and physical examination with appropriate further evaluation (e.g. laboratory testing) can help determine the underlying cause.

== Differential diagnosis ==
Hematuria can be classified according to visibility, anatomical origin, and timing of blood during urination.
* In terms of visibility, hematuria can be visible to the naked eye (termed &quot;gross hematuria&quot;) and may appear red or brown (sometimes referred to as tea-colored), or it can be microscopic (i.e. not visible but detected with a microscope or laboratory test). Microscopic hematuria is present when there are three or more red blood cells per high power field.
* In terms of the anatomical origin, blood or red blood cells can enter and mix with urine at multiple anatomical sites within the urinary system, including the kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra, and in men, the prostate. Additionally, menstruation in women may cause the appearance of hematuria and may result in a positive urine dipstick test for hematuria. The causes corresponding to these anatomic locations can be divided into glomerular and non-glomerular causes, referring to the involvement of the glomerulus of the kidney. Non-glomerular causes can be further subdivided into the upper urinary tract and lower urinary tract causes.
* In terms of the timing during urination, hematuria can be initial, terminal or total, meaning blood can appear in the urine at the onset, midstream, or later. If it appears soon after the onset of urination, a distal site is suggested. A longer delay suggests a more proximal lesion. Hematuria that occurs throughout urination suggests that bleeding is occurring above the level of the bladder.

Many causes may present as either visible hematuria or microscopic hematuria, and so the differential diagnosis is frequently organized based on glomerular and non-glomerular causes.

=== Glomerular hematuria ===

Hematuria due to a glomerular source commonly presents as dysmorphic red blood cells (misshapen red blood cells) or red cell casts (small tubular structures made up of red blood cell components) on urine microscopy. This occurs due to the red blood cells being deformed as they pass through the glomerular capillaries into the renal tubules and eventually into the urinary system. Normally, red blood cells should never pass from the glomerular capillary into the renal tubule, and this is always a pathological process. Glomerular causes include:
* IgA nephropathy
* Thin glomerular basement membrane disease
* Hereditary nephritis (Alport&#x27;s disease)
* Hemolytic uremic syndrome
* Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (group A β-hemolytic &quot;streptococcus pyogenes&quot;)
* Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
* Lupus nephritis
* Henoch–Schönlein purpura
* Nephritic syndrome
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Polycystic kidney disease
* Idiopathic hematuria

=== Non-glomerular hematuria ===
Visible blood clots in the urine indicate a non-glomerular cause. Non-glomerular causes include:
* Urinary tract infections, such as pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, and urethritis
* Kidney stones
* Cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer (particularly transitional cell carcinoma), and in men, prostate cancer
* Urinary tract strictures
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia
* Renal papillary necrosis
* Trauma or damage to the lining of the urinary tract
* Intense exercise
* Increased tendency to bleed due to acquired or genetic conditions (e.g. sickle cell disease or vitamin K deficiency bleeding) or certain medications (e.g. blood thinners)

=== Mimickers of hematuria ===

==== Pigmenturia ====
Not all red or brown urine is caused by hematuria. Other substances such as certain medications and certain foods can cause urine to appear red.

Medications that may cause urine to appear red include:
* Phenazopyridine
* Nitrofurantoin
* Doxorubicin
* Rifampicin

Foods that may cause urine to appear red include:
* Blackberries
* Food dyes.
* Beets
* Rhubarb
* Fava beans

==== False positive urine dipstick ====
A urine dipstick may be falsely positive for hematuria due to other substances in the urine. While the urine dipstick test is able to recognize heme in red blood cells, it also identifies free hemoglobin and myoglobin. Free hemoglobin may be found in the urine resulting from hemolysis, and myoglobin may be found in the urine resulting from rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown). Thus, a positive dipstick test does not necessarily indicate hematuria; rather, microscopy of the urine showing three of more red blood cells per high power field confirms hematuria.

==== Menstruation ====
In women, menstruation may cause the appearance of hematuria and may result in a urine dipstick test positive for hematuria. Menstruation can be ruled out as a cause of hematuria by inquiring about menstruation history and ensuring the urine specimen is collected without menstrual blood.

== In children ==
Common causes of hematuria in children are:
* Fever
* Strenuous exercise
* Acute nephritis
* Congenital abnormalities:
*# Non-vascular: ureteropelvic junction obstruction, posterior urethral valves, urethral prolapse, urethral diverticulum and multicystic dysplastic kidney
*# Vascular: arteriovenous malformations, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias, renal vein thrombosis in newborns.
* Urinary stones.
* Coagulation disorders.
* Mechanical trauma: masturbation, foreign body.
* Nephritic syndrome: IgA nephropathy, Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Benign familial hematuria, Alport syndrome.
* Sickle cell trait or disease.

== Evaluation ==
The evaluation of hematuria is dependent upon the visibility of the blood in the urine (i.e. visible/gross vs microscopic hematuria). Visible hematuria must be investigated, as it may be due to a pathological cause. In those with visible hematuria, urological cancer (most frequently bladder or kidney cancer) is discovered in 20–25%. Hematuria alone without accompanying symptoms should be raise suspicion of malignancy of the urinary tract until proven otherwise. The initial evaluation of patients presenting with signs and symptoms that are consistent of hematuria include assessment of hemodynamic status, underlying cause of hematuria, and ensuring urinary drainage. These steps include assessment of the patient&#x27;s heart rate, blood pressure, a physician exam taken by a healthcare professional, and blood work to ensure the patient&#x27;s hemodynamic status is adequate. It is important to obtain a detailed history from the patient (i.e. recreational, occupational, and medication exposures) as this information can be helpful in suggesting a cause of hematuria. The physical exam can also be helpful in identifying a cause of the hematuria as certain signs found on the physical exam can suggest specific causes of the hematuria. In the event the initial evaluation of hematuria does not reveal an underlying cause then evaluation by a physician who specializes in Urology may proceed. This medical evaluation may consist of, but is not limited too, a history and physical exam taken by healthcare personnel, laboratory studies (i.e. blood work), cystoscopy, and specialized imaging procedures (i.e. CT or MRI).

=== Visible hematuria ===
The first step in evaluation of red or brown colored urine is to confirm true hematuria with urinalysis and urine microscopy, where hematuria is defined by three of more red blood cells per high power field. Although a urine dipstick test may be used, it can give false positive or false negative results. In gathering information, it is important to inquire about recent trauma, urologic procedures, menses, and culture-documented urinary tract infection. If any of these are present, it is appropriate to repeat a urinalysis with urine microscopy in 1 to 2 weeks or after treatment of the infection. If the results of the urinalysis and urine microscopy reveal a glomerular origin of hematuria (indicated by proteinuria or red blood cell casts), consultation with a nephrologist should be made. If the results of the urinalysis indicate a non-glomerular origin, a microbiological culture of the urine should be performed, if it has not been done already. If the culture is positive (indicating a bladder infection), urinalysis and urine microscopy should be repeated following treatment to confirm resolution of the hematuria. If the culture is negative or if hematuria persists after treatment, CT urogram or renal ultrasound and cystoscopy should be performed. Hemodynamic stability should be monitored and a complete blood count should be ordered to assess for anemia.

=== Microscopic hematuria ===
After detecting and confirming hematuria with urinalysis and urine microscopy, the first step in evaluation of microhematuria is to rule out benign causes. Benign causes include urinary tract infection, viral illness, kidney stone, recent intense exercise, menses, recent trauma, or recent urological procedure. After benign causes have resolved or been treated, a repeat urinalysis and urine microscopy is warranted to ensure cessation of hematuria. If hematuria persists (even if there is a suspected cause), the next step is to stratify the risk of the person for urothelial cancer into low, intermediate, or high risk to determine next steps. To be in the low risk category, one must satisfy &quot;all&quot; of the following criteria: Has never smoked tobacco or smoked less than 10 pack-years; is a female less than 50 years old or a male less than 40 years old; has 3–10 red blood cells per high power field; has not had microscopic hematuria before; and has no other risk factors for urothelial cancer. To be in the intermediate risk category, one must satisfy &quot;any&quot; of the following criteria: Has smoked 10–30 pack-years; is a female 50–59 years old or a male aged 40–59 years old; has 11–25 red blood cells per high power field; or was previously a low-risk patient with persistent microscopic hematuria and has 3–25 red blood cells per high power field. To be in the high risk category, one must satisfy &quot;any&quot; of the following criteria: Has smoked more than 30 pack-years; is older than 60 years of age; or has above 25 red blood cells per high power field on any urinalysis. For the low risk category, the next step is to either repeat a urinalysis with urine microscopy in 6 months or perform a cystoscopy and renal ultrasound. For the intermediate risk category, the next step is to perform a cystoscopy and renal ultrasound. For the high risk category, the next step is to perform a cystoscopy and CT urogram. If an underlying cause for hematuria is discovered, it should be managed appropriately. However, if no underlying cause is discovered, the hematuria should be re-evaluated with urinalysis and urine microscopy within 12 months. Additionally, for all risk categories, if a nephrologic origin is suspected, consultation of a nephrologist should be made.

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiology of hematuria can often be explained by damage to the structures of the urinary system, including the kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra, and in men, the prostate. Common mechanisms include structural disruption to the glomerular basement membrane and mechanical or chemical erosion of the mucosal surfaces of the genitourinary tract.

== Management ==
=== Medical emergency: acute clot retention ===

Acute clot retention is one of three emergencies that can occur with hematuria. The other two are anemia and shock. Blood clots can prevent urine outflow through either ureter or the bladder. This is known as acute urinary retention.

Blood clots that remain in the bladder are digested by urinary urokinase producing fibrin fragments. These fibrin fragments are natural anticoagulants and promote ongoing bleeding from the urinary tract. Removing all blood clots prevents the formation of this natural anticoagulant. This in turns facilitates the cessation of bleeding from the urinary tract.

The acute management of obstructing clots is the placement of a large (22–24 French) urethral Foley catheter. Clots are evacuated with a Toomey syringe and saline irrigation. If this does not control the bleeding, management should escalate to continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) via a three-port urethral catheter. If both a large urethral Foley catheter and CBI fail, an urgent cystoscopy in the operating room will be necessary. Lastly, a transfusion and/or a correction of a coexisting coagulopathy may be necessary.

=== Medical emergency: urosepsis ===
Urosepsis is defined as sepsis caused by a urogenital tract infection and comprises about 25% of all sepsis cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagenlehner n/a–n/a&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Urosepsis is the result of a systemic inflammatory response to infection and can be identified by numerous signs and symptoms (e.g. fever, hypothermia, tachycardia, and leukocytosis). Signs and symptoms that indicate a urogential tract infection is the source of the sepsis may include, but are not limited to, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, pain with micturition, urinary retention, and scrotal pain. In terms of the visibility, hematuria can be visible to the naked eye (termed &quot;gross hematuria&quot;) and may appear red or brown (sometimes referred to as tea-colored), or it can be microscopic (i.e. not visible to the eye but detected of urosepsis. In addition to imaging tests, patients may be treated with antibiotics to relieve the infection and intravenous fluids to maintain cardiovascular and renal perfusion. Acute management of hemodynamic status, in the event intravenous fluids are unsuccessful, may include the use of vasopressor medications and the placement of a central venous line.

== Epidemiology ==
In the United States, microscopic hematuria has a prevalence of somewhere between 2% and 31%. Higher rates exist in individuals older than 60 years of age and those with a current or prior history of smoking. Only a fraction of individuals with microhematuria are diagnosed with a urologic cancer. When asymptomatic populations are screened with dipstick and/or microscopy medical testing about 2% to 3% of those with hematuria have a urologic malignancy. Routine screening is not recommended. Individuals with risk factors who undergo repeated testing have higher rates of urologic malignancies. These risks factors include age (&gt; 40 years), male gender, previous or current smoking, chemical exposure (e.g., benzenes, hydrocarbons, aromatic amines), history of chemotherapy (alkylating agents, ifosfamide), prolonged foreign body in the bladder (such as a bladder catheter), prior pelvic radiation therapy, or greater than 25 red blood cells per high powered field on urine microscopy.

The prevalence of microscopic hematuria in North Africa is very high due to the high prevalence of the blood fluke schistosoma haematobium, which chronically infects the urinary tract. 

In pediatric populations, the prevalence is 0.5–2%. Risks factor include older age and female gender. About 5% of individuals with microscopic hematuria receive a cancer diagnosis. 40% of individuals with macroscopic hematuria (blood easily visible in the urine) receive a cancer diagnosis.

<text>Andrew Graham (8 April 1815 – 5 November 1908) was an Irish astronomer, orbit computer and discoverer of the asteroid 9 Metis.

== Astronomer at Markree, County Sligo ==

In 1842 Graham was appointed to work at Markree Observatory in County Sligo in northwest Ireland. The observatory had been established in 1830 by Colonel Edward Joshua Cooper (1798–1863) as a private institution on his country estate. Cooper equipped it with excellent astronomical instruments. Graham proved an energetic observer at Markree.

Graham discovered the asteroid 9 Metis from Markree on 25 April 1848 while observing with a 3-inch aperture wide-field telescope manufactured for comet searching by the German instrument maker Ertel.

Only eight minor planets were known before then, with the first four having been found in the period 1801–1807, and Graham&#x27;s discovery consequently attracted considerable attention. His mathematical abilities allowed him to compute the orbit of the minor planet and to predict its apparent position into the future, including the gravitational effects of planets on its orbit around the Sun.

Graham later worked on the Markree Catalogue, which consisted of observations of about sixty thousand stars along the ecliptic taken between 8 August 1848 and 27 March 1856, and was published in four volumes in the years 1851, 1853, 1854 and 1856 respectively. Whilst working on this, he developed the square-bar micrometer, which greatly increased the efficiency of determining positions (right ascension and declination) of celestial objects.

Graham calculated the orbits of a large number of comets. These were used in his employer&#x27;s book &quot;Cometic Orbits&quot;.

Graham resigned from his position at Markree and began new employment in Cambridge in March 1864.

== Assistant at the Cambridge Observatory ==

Graham worked as First Assistant at the Cambridge Observatory, England, from 1864 to 1903.

There he worked on the Cambridge Zone Catalogue, the Observatory&#x27;s contribution to the catalogue of stars brighter than magnitude 9.5 organised by the Astronomische Gesellschaft in Germany. This was in many ways an extension of his work at Markree, but for stars some distance to the north of the ecliptic. The catalogue of 14,464 stars between declinations 24° and 31° north was published in 1897.

Graham collaborated with Anne Walker in the observing, who, although employed as a `lady computer&#x27; to perform routine mathematical calculations, regularly shared the observing tasks with Graham in a successful professional partnership.

Graham retired from his post at the Cambridge Observatory in 1903 at the age of 88 years. He was granted a pension by the University of Cambridge. He died in Cambridge in 1908 aged 93 years.

<doc id="582973" wikidata="Q546591" url="?curid=582973" title="Joe Paterno">
<text>Joseph Vincent Paterno (; December 21, 1926 – January 22, 2012), sometimes referred to as JoePa, was an American college football player, athletic director, and coach. He was the head coach of the Penn State Nittany Lions from 1966 to 2011. With 409 victories, Paterno is the most victorious coach in NCAA FBS history. He recorded his 409th victory on October 29, 2011; his career ended with his dismissal from the team on November 9, 2011, as a result of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. He died 74 days later, of complications from lung cancer.

Paterno was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Brown University, where he played football both ways as the quarterback and a cornerback. He had originally planned on going to law school, but he was instead hired in 1950 as an assistant football coach at Penn State. He was persuaded to do this by his college coach Rip Engle, who had taken over as Penn State&#x27;s head coach. In 1966, Paterno was named as Engle&#x27;s successor. He soon coached the team to two undefeated regular seasons in 1968 and 1969. The team won two national championships—in 1982 and 1986. Paterno coached five undefeated teams that won major bowl games, and in 2007 he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach. During his career, he led the Nittany Lions to 37 bowl appearances with 24 wins while turning down offers to coach National Football League (NFL) teams that included the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots.

Paterno&#x27;s coaching career ended abruptly in 2011, shortly before his death, when the Penn State Board of Trustees terminated his contract in response to a child sex abuse scandal involving Paterno&#x27;s former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. An investigation conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh reported that Paterno concealed information relating to Sandusky&#x27;s abuse of a young boy. A critique of the Freeh report, commissioned by the Paterno family, disputed Paterno&#x27;s involvement in the alleged cover-up.

In 2012, the NCAA vacated all of Penn State&#x27;s wins from 1998 through 2011 as part of its punishment. State Senator Jake Corman used the Freeh report as a basis to sue the NCAA, asserting that both Freeh and the NCAA had collaborated and failed to follow due process. Corman released emails showing &quot;regular and substantive&quot; contact between NCAA officials and Freeh&#x27;s investigators, suggesting that Freeh&#x27;s conclusions were orchestrated. In a 2015 legal settlement with Penn State, the NCAA reversed its decision and restored all 111 wins to Paterno&#x27;s record.

==Early life and education==
Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Florence de LaSalle Cafiero, a homemaker, and Angelo Lafayette Paterno, a law clerk. His family was of Italian ancestry. He spoke with a marked Brooklyn accent throughout his life. In 1944, Paterno graduated from Brooklyn Preparatory School. Six weeks later, he was drafted into the United States Army during World War II. Paterno spent a year in the Army before being discharged in time to start the 1946 school year at Brown University, where his tuition was paid by Busy Arnold.

At Brown University, Paterno was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He played quarterback and cornerback for the Bears, and he shares the career record for interceptions (14) with Greg Parker. Paterno graduated as an English literature major in 1950.

==Career==
===Penn State Nittany Lions===
Paterno had been accepted to Boston University School of Law, and was planning to attend before changing his mind and deciding to coach at Penn State. After hearing of his career choice, his father asked, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, what did you go to college for?&quot; Paterno joined Rip Engle as an assistant coach at Penn State in 1950; Engle had coached five seasons, from 1944 to 1949, at Brown University.

In June 1964, Paterno was promoted to associate coach, the top assistant coaching position. In 1966, when Engle announced his retirement, Penn State University announced Paterno as his successor the following day.

Over his coaching career, Paterno had one Heisman Trophy winner, John Cappelletti, who earned the award in 1973.

Penn State football struggled from 2000 to 2004, with an overall 26–33 record in those years and Paterno became the target of criticism from some Penn State faithful. Many in the media attributed Penn State&#x27;s struggles to Paterno&#x27;s advancing age. He had no apparent plans to retire, and contingents of fans and alumni began calling for him to step down. Paterno rebuffed all of this and stated he would fulfill his contract until it expired in 2008. Reflecting the growth in Penn State&#x27;s stature, Beaver Stadium was expanded six times during his tenure, increasing in size from 46,284 in 1966 to 106,572 in 2001.

During a speech in Pittsburgh on May 12, 2005, Paterno announced that he would consider retirement if the 2005 football team had a disappointing season. &quot;If we don&#x27;t win some games, I&#x27;ve got to get my rear end out of here&quot;, Paterno said in a speech at the Duquesne Club. &quot;Simple as that&quot;. Penn State finished the season with a record of 11–1 and were champions of the Big Ten in 2005. They defeated Florida State 26–23 in triple overtime in the 2006 Orange Bowl.

The 2009 season was Paterno&#x27;s 44th as head coach of the Nittany Lions, passing Amos Alonzo Stagg for the most years as head coach at a single institution in Division I.

Paterno&#x27;s abbreviated 2011 season was his 62nd on the Penn State coaching staff, which gave him the record for most seasons for any football coach at a single university.

From 2002 onward, Penn State faced a litany of players&#x27; off-the-field legal problems, which included 46 Penn State football players facing 163 criminal charges, of which 118 charges were dismissed or not proven, according to an ESPN analysis of Pennsylvania court records and reports.

The Pennsylvania State Employees&#x27; Retirement System (SERS) revealed Paterno&#x27;s salary in November 2007 as $512,664. He was paid $490,638 in 2006. &quot;I&#x27;m paid well, I&#x27;m not overpaid,&quot; Paterno said during an interview with reporters Wednesday before the salary disclosure. &quot;I got all the money I need&quot;.

Paterno was known for his gameday image — thick glasses, rolled-up dress slacks (by his admission, to save on cleaning bills), white socks and Brooklyn-tinged speech.

====Bowls and championships====

Paterno holds an official NCAA total of 18 bowl victories. He holds the NCAA record for total bowl appearances with 37. He had a bowl record of 24 wins, 12 losses, and 1 tie following a defeat in the 2011 Outback Bowl. Paterno was the first coach with the distinction of having won each of the four major bowls — Rose, Orange, Fiesta, and Sugar — as well as the Cotton Bowl Classic, at least once. Penn State won at least three bowl games in each of the four decades in which Paterno coached the entire decade, from 1970 thru 2009.

Paterno led Penn State to two national championships (1982 and 1986) and five undefeated, untied seasons (1968, 1969, 1973, 1986, and 1994). Four of his unbeaten teams (1968, 1969, 1973, and 1994) won major bowl games and were not awarded a national championship.

Under Paterno, Penn State won the Orange Bowl (1968, 1969, 1973 and 2005), the Cotton Bowl Classic (1972 and 1974), the Fiesta Bowl (1977, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1991, and 1996), the Liberty Bowl (1979), the Sugar Bowl (1982), the Aloha Bowl (1983), the Holiday Bowl (1989), the Citrus Bowl (1993 and 2010), the Rose Bowl Game (1994), the Outback Bowl (1995, 1998 and 2006), and the Alamo Bowl (1999 and 2007).

After Penn State joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the Nittany Lions under Paterno won the Big Ten championship three times (1994, 2005 and 2008). Paterno had 29 finishes in the Top 10 national rankings.

On May 16, 2006, Paterno was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame after the National Football Foundation decided to change its rules and allow any coach over the age of 75 to be eligible for the Hall of Fame instead of having to wait until retirement. However, on November 4, 2006, he was injured during a sideline collision during a game against Wisconsin. As a result of his injuries, he was unable to travel to the induction ceremonies in New York City, and the National Football Foundation announced that he would instead be inducted as a part of the Hall of Fame class of 2007. Paterno was inducted on December 4, 2007, and officially enshrined in a ceremony held July 19, 2008.

In 2009, Paterno was named to &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of 50 greatest coaches of all time, including coaches from Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, college basketball, and college football, ranked 13th overall.

In 2010, the Maxwell Football Club of Philadelphia established the Joseph V. Paterno Award, to be awarded annually to the college football coach &quot;who has made a positive impact on his university, his players and his community.&quot; Following the breaking of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal the following year, the award was discontinued by the club.

Also in 2010, the Big Ten Conference established the Stagg – Paterno Championship Trophy as the annual trophy to be awarded to the winner of the conference football championship. However, on November 14, 2011, the trophy name was changed to the Stagg Championship Trophy in light of the Sandusky child abuse scandal.

Paterno was also nominated for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. However, in light of the Sandusky child abuse scandal, U.S. Senators Pat Toomey and Bob Casey Jr., and Representative Glenn Thompson withdrew their support of Paterno receiving the honor.

==Child sex abuse scandal and dismissal==

On November 5, 2011, former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was arrested on 52 counts of child sexual abuse occurring between 1994 and 2009, including allegations of incidents on the Penn State campus. A 2011 grand jury investigation reported that then-graduate assistant Mike McQueary told Paterno in 2002 (prosecutors later amended the date to 2001) that he had seen Sandusky abusing a 10-year-old boy in Penn State football&#x27;s shower facilities. According to the report, Paterno notified Athletic Director Tim Curley about the incident and later notified Gary Schultz, vice president of finance and business, to whom the University Police directly reported. Paterno said McQueary informed him that &quot;he had witnessed an incident in the shower... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report.&quot; In his grand jury testimony, Paterno stated that McQueary had described Sandusky &quot;fondling&quot; a young boy in an act he described as of a &quot;sexual nature,&quot; but stopped short of the rape to which McQueary would later testify. Despite the nature of the 2001 incident and that it later became clear that Curley and other university officials had not reported the allegations to police, Paterno did not then notify police either. Instead, two weeks later, Curley reported that Sandusky&#x27;s keys to the locker room had been taken away and that the incident was reported to The Second Mile charity. Sandusky was also banned from bringing children onto the Penn State campus. While the prosecutors did not accuse Paterno of any wrongdoing, he was questioned over his apparent failure to follow up on his report to his boss about McQueary&#x27;s statements. Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said that Paterno was cooperative with prosecutors and that he met his statutory responsibility to report the 2001 incident to school administrators.

Under Pennsylvania state law at the time, any state employee who learned about suspected child abuse was required to report the incident to their immediate supervisor. In the case of the 2001 incident, McQueary reported the incident to his immediate supervisor, Paterno. In turn, Paterno reported the incident to &quot;his&quot; immediate supervisor, Curley, who then reported it to Gary Schultz, former senior vice president for business and finance, a position to which the University Police Department directly reported. (Schultz failed to notify his subordinate, the director of university police.) For these reasons, Paterno did not come under criminal suspicion. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan, however, criticized Paterno for not doing enough to stop Sandusky&#x27;s crimes. Noonan stated that while Paterno may have done what he was legally required to do, anyone with knowledge of possible sexual abuse against minors had &quot;moral requirements&quot; to notify police.

On the night of November 8, hundreds of students gathered in front of Paterno&#x27;s home in support of the beleaguered coach. Paterno thanked the crowd and said, &quot;The kids who were victims or whatever they want to say, I think we all ought to say a prayer for them. It&#x27;s a tough life when people do certain things to you.&quot; As Paterno began walking back into his home with the crowd chanting &quot;Let Joe Stay,&quot; he turned around to instead lead the crowd in &quot;We are Penn State&quot; cheers, which unnamed members of the Penn State Board of Trustees viewed as insensitive. Within days of the scandal breaking in full, speculation was rife that Paterno would not be allowed to return as head coach. On November 9, Paterno announced that he would retire at the end of the season, stating:
Later that evening, however, the board of trustees voted to terminate Paterno&#x27;s contract, effective immediately. They considered but ultimately rejected the idea of letting Paterno finish out the season, saying that growing outrage at the situation would have made it impossible for him to be effective as coach. Unable to reach Paterno personally due to the crowd around his house and not wanting Paterno to find out through the media, the board notified him of their decision over the telephone. Tom Bradley, Sandusky&#x27;s successor as defensive coordinator, was named interim head coach for the remainder of the 2011 season. At the same meeting, university president Graham Spanier resigned rather than face being fired as well. That night, several thousand Penn State students chanting Paterno&#x27;s name rioted in the streets, hurling rocks, tearing down street signs, and overturning a news van.

Paterno supporters and family members continued to harshly criticize the board&#x27;s actions in the months following his death, prompting the board in March 2012 to release an additional statement explaining their decision. In it, the board said that it opted to remove Paterno after finding that &quot;his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership.&quot; The board had earlier said there were three key reasons for his firing: his failure to do more when told about a suspected sexual assault by Jerry Sandusky; what the board of trustees regarded as his questioning of the board&#x27;s authority in the days after Sandusky&#x27;s arrest; and what the board determined to be his inability to effectively continue coaching in the face of continuing questions surrounding the program. However, in late 2014 and early 2015, court depositions by trustees Kenneth Frazier and Keith Masser conflicted with the &quot;failure of leadership&quot; story. Masser stated, &quot;The decision to remove Coach Paterno had nothing to do with what he had known, what he hadn&#x27;t done. It was based upon the distraction of having him on the sidelines would have caused the university and the current football team harm. It had nothing to do with what Coach Paterno had done, or hadn&#x27;t done.&quot;

===Posthumous findings===
Former FBI director Louis Freeh and his firm, including a team of former federal prosecutors and FBI agents, were hired by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an independent investigation into the scandal. In the opinion of writer Michael Sokolove, the mission Freeh was given seemed to speculate that Sandusky&#x27;s crimes were not his alone and that people who had reason to suspect him had looked away. After interviewing over 400 people and reviewing voluminous documents, the investigation team reported that Paterno, Spanier, Curley, and Schultz (none of whom was interviewed) concealed Sandusky&#x27;s actions in order to protect the publicity surrounding Penn State&#x27;s celebrated football program. Freeh&#x27;s firm&#x27;s investigation concluded that by their actions, the four men &quot;failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade.&quot; The report asserted that Paterno, Schultz, Spanier, and Curley &quot;concealed Sandusky&#x27;s activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities.&quot;

Freeh&#x27;s investigators discovered an email between Curley and Schultz regarding a previous incident between Sandusky and another child in 1998 that the district attorney declined to prosecute after an investigation by State College police and an evaluation by the Department of Public Welfare. On May 13, 1998, in an email with the subject &quot;Jerry,&quot; Curley asked Schultz, &quot;Anything new in this department? Coach is anxious to know where it stands.&quot; Curley testified more than nineteen years later in the 2017 criminal trial against Spanier that the &quot;coach&quot; who wanted to know where it stands was Paterno. Before a grand jury in 2011, when Paterno was asked, other than the 2001 incident that Mike McQueary reported to him, whether he knew of any other inappropriate sexual conduct by Sandusky with young boys, Paterno testified, &quot;I do not know of anything else that Jerry would be involved in of that nature, no. I do not know of it. You did mention — I think you said something about a rumor. It may have been discussed in my presence, something else about somebody. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t remember, and I could not honestly say I heard a rumor.&quot;

Freeh&#x27;s team also discovered a 2001 email from Curley about the subsequent 2001 incident in which McQueary witnessed Sandusky with a boy in the Penn State showers. On February 25, Curley, Schultz, and Spanier decided to have Curley report McQueary&#x27;s information to the state Department of Public Welfare. On February 26, Curley had a conversation with Paterno. (Curley testified in 2017, &quot;I don&#x27;t recall the specific conversation or what his [Paterno&#x27;s] reaction was.&quot;) On February 27, Curley emailed Spanier and Schultz that he was &quot;having trouble with going to everyone, but the person involved&quot;. (In 2017 he testified that was his opinion. &quot;I wanted the first step to be a meeting with Jerry Sandusky.&quot;) 
Curley, Schultz and Spanier then agreed to report the incident to both the Department of Public Welfare and the Second Mile if Sandusky did not cooperate and get professional help (i.e., rather than not reporting the incident to authorities outside the university, reporting to the Department of Public Welfare was still part of the plan). In his press release, Freeh wrote to the contrary that &quot;the only known, intervening factor between the decision made on February 25, 2001 by Messrs. Spanier, Curley and Schulz to report the incident to the Department of Public Welfare, and then [as alleged by Freeh] agreeing not to do so on February 27th, was Mr. Paterno&#x27;s February 26th conversation with Mr. Curley.&quot; Freeh&#x27;s mischaracterization of the February 27 email was widely inferred by the press to mean that Paterno had persuaded Curley (and Schultz and Spanier) not to report the incident to authorities outside the university.

In addition, the Freeh report said that even after Sandusky&#x27;s retirement in 1999, Paterno, Schultz, Spanier, and Curley &quot;empowered Sandusky to attract potential victims to the campus and football events by allowing him to have continued, unrestricted and unsupervised access to the University&#x27;s facilities and affiliation with the University&#x27;s prominent football program.&quot; Sandusky&#x27;s access was part of the retirement agreement between the university and Sandusky: &quot;The university will permit you to use, at no charge, a locker, weight rooms, fitness facilities and training room in the East Area locker room complex. This benefit will continue for the balance of your lifetime,&quot; and &quot;For a period of ten years commencing July 1, 1999 and subject to renewal upon concurrence of both parties you will be given an office and a phone in the East Area Locker room complex ...&quot; The agreement was signed by Curley and Schultz along with Sandusky on June 29, 1999.

Following the release of the Freeh report, Nike, Inc. removed Paterno&#x27;s name from the Joe Paterno Child Development Center, a child care facility at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Brown University, Paterno&#x27;s alma mater, announced that it would remove Paterno&#x27;s name from its annual award honoring outstanding male freshman athletes and stated his status in the Brown Athletic Hall of Fame would be placed under review.
On July 14, 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that in January 2011, Paterno opened &quot;surprise&quot; negotiations to prematurely end his contract with an additional $3 million early retirement payout, prior to public knowledge of the scandal. Although his contract was not up for negotiation until the end of 2011, Paterno initiated negotiations with his superiors to amend his contract in January 2011, the same month he was notified of the police investigation. By August 2011, Paterno and his attorneys had reached a deal with the PSU Board for a total package worth $5.5 million, including a $3 million cash payout, forgiveness of a $350,000 interest-free loan issued by the university, and the use of a private box at Beaver Stadium and a private jet for 25 years, if he agreed the 2011 season would be his last. Ultimately, the board rejected Paterno&#x27;s offer to resign at the end of the 2011 season. But following Paterno&#x27;s firing, faced with hate mail and a threat of a defamation lawsuit by Paterno&#x27;s family, the board agreed to give Paterno and his family the $5.5 million package, which included additional perks for the family. A lawyer for the family said that Penn State proposed the retirement package.

After the Freeh report&#x27;s release, critics called for the removal of the Joe Paterno statue outside Beaver Stadium. A small plane towed a banner over campus, reading &quot;Take the Statue Down or We Will&quot;. After some days of mixed messages, the school removed the statue on Sunday, July 22, in front of a crowd of student onlookers. The statue was reportedly put in storage. Spanier&#x27;s successor as president, Rodney Erickson, said the statue had become &quot;a source of division and an obstacle to healing&quot; but made a distinction between it and the Paterno Library, also on campus.

On July 23, two weeks after the release of the Freeh report, the NCAA punished Penn State with some of the most severe sanctions ever handed down in the history of collegiate athletics. Penn State was fined $60 million, stripped of 40 total scholarships from 2013 to 2017, banned from postseason play until 2016, and vacated all 112 of its wins dating back to 1998. This included the removal of Paterno&#x27;s last 111 wins at Penn State, dropping him from first to 12th on the all-time wins list. (In early 2015 the wins were restored.) The NCAA reported that &quot;Penn State&#x27;s leadership failed to value and uphold institutional integrity, breaching both the NCAA Constitution and Division I rules&quot;, and that the NCAA &quot;intended to remediate the &#x27;sports is king&#x27; culture that led to failures in leadership&quot;. The NCAA report harshly criticized Paterno for his role in an alleged cover-up of Sandusky&#x27;s crimes, saying that Paterno, Spanier, Schultz, and Curley had demonstrated &quot;a failure of institutional and individual integrity&quot;. Although this action was outside the normal process for investigating major violations, the NCAA said this action was merited because the alleged cover-up violated basic principles of intercollegiate athletics that were over and above specific policies.

In a September 2013 interview with the CBS show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Sandusky prosecutor Frank Fina was asked if he believed Joe Paterno was involved in the alleged cover-up. Fina stated, &quot;I do not. And I&#x27;m viewing this strictly on the evidence, not any kind of fealty to anybody. I did not find that evidence.&quot;

===Response to the Freeh Report===
On September 13, 2012, a group of alumni and supporters called Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship released a review of the Freeh Report that was critical of the Freeh Group&#x27;s investigation and conclusions. In February 2013, Paterno&#x27;s family released a report written by Dick Thornburgh, a former U.S. attorney general and Pennsylvania governor, disputing Freeh&#x27;s investigative methods and the portrayal of Paterno in his findings, calling the Freeh report a &quot;rush to injustice&quot;. Thornburgh concluded that the Freeh report was &quot;seriously flawed, both with respect to the process of [its] investigation and its findings related to Mr. Paterno&quot;. In response, Freeh called the Paterno family&#x27;s report &quot;self-serving&quot; and said that it did not change the facts and findings of his initial investigation.

NBC sportscaster Bob Costas said, &quot;What Freeh did was not only gather facts but he reached a conclusion which is at least debatable from those facts and then he assigned a motivation, not only to Curley and Schultz and Spanier, but he specifically assigned a very dark motivation to Joe Paterno, which seems like it might be quite a leap. ... A reasonable person will conclude that there is some doubt here and that the other side of the story deserves to be heard.&quot; Similarly Todd Blackledge, ESPN college football analyst and former Penn State quarterback, noted on the media coverage, &quot;it felt like the media felt at liberty to just connect [] all those dots, whether they had facts. Based on whatever information they had, they were going to connect the dots and tell a story. And it had tremendous momentum. Because of the serious and horrendous nature of the allegations against Jerry, that narrative went pretty much unopposed.&quot;

In 2014 NCAA internal emails revealed that the NCAA worked closely with Louis Freeh in his investigation of the Sandusky scandal. In addition, emails revealed that many in the NCAA questioned whether they had the authority to sanction Penn State and that some officials wanted to &quot;bluff&quot; Penn State&#x27;s leadership into accepting a severe punishment, because they believed that they did not have the authority to punish Penn State. On the day the Freeh Report was released, Oregon State president Ed Ray, chairman of the NCAA&#x27;s executive committee, sent an e-mail to NCAA president Mark Emmert, his deputy, and the former enforcement head of the NCAA that directed them to come up with a way to sanction Penn State.

Freeh had maintained publicly that his investigation was entirely independent and would include &quot;no favoritism&quot;. This was criticized by Pennsylvania state Senator Jake Corman, who claimed, &quot;There clearly is a significant amount of communication between Freeh and the NCAA that goes way beyond merely providing information. I&#x27;d call it coordination ... Clearly, Freeh went way past his mandate. He was the enforcement person for the NCAA. That&#x27;s what it looks like. I don&#x27;t know how you can look at it any other way. It&#x27;s almost like the NCAA hired him to do their enforcement investigation on Penn State. At a minimum, it is inappropriate. At a maximum, these were two parties working together to get an outcome that was predetermined.&quot; NCAA Vice President of Academic and Membership Affairs Kevin Lennon wrote in another email from July 14 that the NCAA was &quot;banking on the fact the school is so embarrassed they will do anything&quot; before interim Penn State president Rodney Erickson signed the consent decree.

In January 2013, Senator Corman and state treasurer Rob McCord used the Freeh report as a basis to sue the NCAA, arguing that the $60 million fine should be kept to assist victims of child sexual abuse in Pennsylvania, instead of allowing it to be spread to programs beyond the state&#x27;s boundaries.

On May 30, 2013, the Paterno family and members of the Penn State community (though not the university itself) filed a lawsuit in the Centre County Court of Common Pleas in an attempt to overturn sanctions against the school. The lawsuit asserted that the NCAA and the other defendants breached their contractual obligations, violated their duties of good faith and fair dealing, intentionally interfered with contractual relations, and defamed and/or commercially disparaged the individuals filing the lawsuit.

On January 16, 2015, the NCAA agreed to a settlement, removing the probationary period imposed on Penn State and restoring Paterno&#x27;s 111 wins between 1998 and 2011. Corman proclaimed, &quot;Today is a victory for due process which was not afforded in this case. Today is a victory for the people of Pennsylvania. Today is a victory for Penn State nation.&quot;

A year after the report was issued, the chairman of the Penn State Board of Trustees, which had originally commissioned the report, said that Freeh&#x27;s conclusions amounted to &quot;speculation.&quot; In a January 2015 interview with the Associated Press, Penn State President Eric Barron said, &quot;I have to say, I&#x27;m not a fan of the report. There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind, Freeh steered everything as if he were a prosecutor trying to convince a court to take the case.&quot;

On July 12, 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that, in a document created in 2014, an anonymous man alleged that Sandusky had touched him inappropriately in 1976 and that he had told Paterno the next day.

==Views on college football issues==

Paterno was a long-time advocate for some type of college football playoff system. The question was posed to him frequently over the years, as only one of his five undefeated teams was voted national champion. The college football playoff system would become a reality three years after Paterno&#x27;s exit from the game.

Paterno believed that scholarship college athletes should receive a modest stipend so that they have some spending money. As justification, Paterno pointed out that many scholarship athletes came from poor families and that other students had time to hold down a part-time job, whereas busy practice and conditioning schedules prevented college athletes from working during the school year.

Paterno initially preferred not to play true freshmen, but later in his career he did play redshirts in order to refrain from being at a competitive disadvantage. Some Penn State recruits, like recruits at many other schools, now graduate from high school a semester early so that they can enroll in college during the spring semester and participate in spring practice. Several team members from the recruiting class of 2005, including Justin King, Anthony Scirrotto, and Derrick Williams, received considerable playing time as true freshmen during the 2005–2006 season.

In 2010, Paterno and former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka suggested that concussions and other injuries in the NFL and college football might be reduced if face masks were eliminated.

Penn State&#x27;s football players were twice recognized for outstanding academic performance by the New America Foundation&#x27;s Academic Bowl Championship Series while under the leadership of Paterno. The team was ranked number one out of the top 25 ranked BCS teams in 2009 and 2011. The criteria in the rankings include the graduation rate of the team as compared to the rest of university, the difference between the graduation rate of African-American players and the rest of the squad as well as the same statistics for the rest of the students at Penn State, and the graduation rate differences between the African American players and students.

===Officiating and instant replay===
In 2002, 76-year-old Paterno chased down referee Dick Honig in a dead sprint following a 42–35 overtime home loss to Iowa. Paterno saw Tony Johnson catch a pass for a first down with both feet in bounds on the stadium&#x27;s video replay board, but the play was ruled an incompletion. This being after Penn State had rallied from a 35–13 deficit with 9 minutes left in the game to tie the score at 35, and were driving on their first possession in overtime (a touchdown would have tied the game at 42). Penn State failed on fourth down and Iowa held on for the win.

Just weeks later, in the final minute of the Michigan game, the same wide receiver, Johnson, made a catch that would have given Penn State a first down and put them in range for a game-winning field goal. Although Johnson was ruled out of bounds, replays clearly showed that Johnson had both feet in bounds and the catch should have been ruled complete.

In 2004, the Big Ten Conference became the first college football conference to adopt a form of instant replay. The previous two incidents, along with Paterno&#x27;s public objections, and the Big Ten&#x27;s Clockgate controversy, are often cited as catalysts for its adoption. Within the next year, almost all of the Division I-A conferences adopted a form of instant replay based on the Big Ten model.

==Outside of football==

===Philanthropy and education===

After the announcement of his appointment as head coach in 1966, Paterno set out to conduct what he called a &quot;Grand Experiment&quot; in melding athletics and academics in the collegiate environment, an idea that he had learned during his years at Brown. As a result, Penn State&#x27;s players have consistently demonstrated above-average academic success compared to Division I-A schools nationwide. According to the NCAA&#x27;s 2008 Graduation Rates Report, Penn State&#x27;s four-year Graduation Success Rate of 78% easily exceeds the 67% Division I average, second to only Northwestern among Big Ten institutions. In 2011, Penn State football players had an 80% graduation rate and showed no achievement gap between its black and white players, which is extremely rare for Division I football teams. The New American Foundation ranked Penn State No. 1 in its 2011 Academic Bowl Championship Series.

Paterno was also renowned for his charitable contributions to academics at Penn State. He and his wife Sue have contributed over $4 million towards various departments and colleges, including support for the Penn State All-Sports Museum, which opened in 2002, and the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center, which opened in 2003. After helping raise over $13.5 million in funds for the 1997 expansion of Pattee Library, the university named the expansion Paterno Library in their honor.

In 2007, former player Franco Harris and his company R Super Foods honored Paterno for his contributions to Penn State by featuring his story and picture on boxes of Super Donuts and Super Buns in Central PA. A portion of the sales will be donated to an endowment fund for the university library that bears his name.

Paterno also attended the annual Penn State Dance Marathon, a popular weekend-long charity event and the largest student-run philanthropy in the world (it raised over $10 million in 2012), every year to raise money for kids with cancer.

===Political interests===

Paterno was a political conservative and a personal friend of President George H. W. Bush. He campaigned for Bush door-to-door in the 1988 New Hampshire primary, and seconded his nomination at the Republican National Convention. Paterno was also a close friend of President Gerald R. Ford, and introduced President George W. Bush at a campaign rally before the 2004 presidential election. Before the 1974 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, a group of Pennsylvania Republican Party leaders briefly considered Paterno for Andrew Lewis&#x27; ticket as the candidate for lieutenant governor.

In 2004, his son Scott Paterno, an attorney, won the Republican primary for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 17th congressional district but lost in the November general election to Democratic incumbent Tim Holden. &quot;I brought my kids up to think for themselves since day one,&quot; Joe Paterno said in 2008. &quot;I got a son who&#x27;s a Republican, who ran for Congress, Scott. I&#x27;m a Republican. I&#x27;ve got a son, Jay, who&#x27;s for Obama. I&#x27;ve got a daughter, who I&#x27;m pretty sure she&#x27;s going to be for Hillary [Clinton]. So God bless America.&quot;

===Personal life===
While serving as an assistant coach, Paterno met freshman coed Suzanne Pohland at the campus library; she was a Latrobe native 13 years his junior and an English literature honors student. They married in 1962, the year she graduated. They had five children: Diana, Joseph Jr. &quot;Jay&quot;, Mary Kay, David, and Scott. All of their children are Penn State graduates, and Jay Paterno was the quarterbacks coach at Penn State until his departure following the hiring of new head coach Bill O&#x27;Brien on January 7, 2012. The Paternos had 17 grandchildren.

Paterno was a longtime summer resident of Avalon, New Jersey.

Paterno and Suzanne co-authored the children&#x27;s book &quot;We Are Penn State!&quot;, which takes place during a typical Penn State homecoming weekend.
==Deteriorating health and death==

In November 2006, Paterno was involved in a sideline collision during a game against Wisconsin. He was unable to avoid the play and was struck in the knee by Badgers linebacker DeAndre Levy&#x27;s helmet. Paterno, then 79 years old, suffered a fractured shin bone and damage to knee ligaments. He coached the 2007 Outback Bowl from the press box before making a full recovery.

In November 2008, Paterno had successful hip replacement surgery after spraining his leg while trying to demonstrate onside kicks during a practice session. While recovering, he coached the remainder of the season and the 2009 Rose Bowl from the press box. After sustaining these injuries, he made use of a golf cart to move around the field during practices.

Paterno was injured again in August 2011, after colliding with a player during practice. He sustained hairline fractures to his hip and shoulder. No surgery was required, but Paterno began the 2011 regular season schedule in a wheelchair.

On November 18, 2011, just nine days after his dismissal from Penn State, Paterno&#x27;s son Scott reported that his father had a treatable form of lung cancer. On January 13, 2012, Paterno was hospitalized in State College for complications relating to his cancer treatment, and he remained there until his death nine days later on January 22, 2012; his death came 74 days after his dismissal from Penn State. His death resulted in tributes from prominent leaders in the U.S., including former President George H. W. Bush, who called Paterno &quot;an outstanding American who was respected not only on the field of play but in life generally—and he was, without a doubt, a true icon in the world of sports.&quot; Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett said of Paterno, &quot;His legacy as the winningest coach in major college football and his generosity to Penn State as an institution and to his players, stand as monuments to his life. ... His place in our state&#x27;s history is secure.&quot; On January 23, Corbett ordered all state flags to be lowered to half staff in Paterno&#x27;s honor. At the time of his death, Penn State was still finalizing Paterno&#x27;s retirement package.

Paterno&#x27;s funeral was held in State College on January 25, 2012. About 750 mourners attended the private ceremony, after which thousands of mourners lined the route of the funeral procession. Paterno was buried in Spring Creek Presbyterian Cemetery just outside the town. Approximately 12,000 people attended a public memorial service that was held at the Bryce Jordan Center on January 26, 2012.

==Head coaching record==
At the time of his death, Paterno had accumulated a record of 409 wins, 136 losses, and 3 ties. However, on July 23, 2012, the NCAA officially vacated 111 of Paterno&#x27;s wins based on the findings of the Freeh report regarding his involvement in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. All wins dating back to 1998 were vacated, the year Paterno was first informed of Sandusky&#x27;s suspected child abuse. Based on the criteria used by the NCAA, Paterno no longer held the record for most victories by an NCAA Division I football coach. Former Florida State coach Bobby Bowden held the NCAA major college record for wins at 377, while for NCAA Division I schools, Grambling State University coach Eddie Robinson&#x27;s 408 victories stood as the official record. The 111 wins were restored on January 16, 2015, as a part of a settlement between the NCAA and Penn State, once again making him the most victorious coach in FBS NCAA football history.

<text>Probot was a heavy metal side project of former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl. Described by Grohl as &quot;a death metal &quot;Supernatural&quot;&quot;, the album mixes instrumentals recorded by Grohl himself with various metal singers whom the musician admired. The album was released in February 2004 by Southern Lord Records. It featured one single entitled &quot;Centuries of Sin&quot;/&quot;The Emerald Law&quot;.

==Background==
After years of popularity in the alternative rock scene, Dave Grohl wanted to express the passion for heavy metal he bore since his youth. He mentioned the catalyst of the experience being during the first leg of the tour in support of the Foo Fighters album &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot;, with the mellower songs making him think about the heavier bands he used to listen to. Following the tour, Grohl went to his house in Alexandria, Virginia, to record some heavier songs in his home studio Studio 606 with Adam Kasper. Grohl would play with his Gibson Explorer through a small Peavey amp as he watched TV with Kasper, and once he got a riff that interested him, he would bring Kasper along to the basement, recording a drum arrangement followed by bass and guitar. Each instrumental would take about 45 minutes to complete. Grohl said that he did not intend to make an album out of the recordings – &quot;I didn’t even call them songs because they were bare instrumentals with no intention of putting vocals on them and no direction as an actual song.&quot; After four days of recording, Grohl and Kasper had done seven tracks, with Grohl making some copies out of the master tape before labeling it Probot to distinguish from the Foo Fighters&#x27; work.
Some time later, inspired by the Santana album &quot;Supernatural&quot;, Grohl decided to attempt collaborations with singers he had idolized. He came up with &quot;my wish list of all of my favorite singers from this era which is &#x27;82 to &#x27;89 underground metal, and all the bands I listened to at the time: Eric Wagner from Trouble, Snake from Voivod, Cronos [from Venom], Lemmy and Wino,&quot; and started contacting the musicians, some of whom were reached by Grohl&#x27;s friend Matt Sweeney given the Foo Fighters had restarted their tour. Grohl feared his fame built out of being &quot;a stupid, middle-of-the-road, alternative-rock idiot&quot; could drive the metal singers away, but many agreed immediately. Cronos would later explain that &quot;I&#x27;m open for everything. And Dave&#x27;s cool,&quot; detailing that Grohl&#x27;s email opened with &quot;a real fan letter&quot; where he mentioned his longtime appreciation of Venom, and then explained about his idea of a metal album with all his metal heroes &quot;to get something off his chest.&quot;

Seeing the positive response, Grohl brought Kasper and Sweeney back to do five more instrumental tracks and round out the project. According to Grohl, the songs sent to Eric Wagner and King Diamond had been previously done for Ozzy Osbourne as he was contacted to write for the then-upcoming &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, but when Osbourne&#x27;s label did not respond, he repurposed them for Probot. Sweeney would organize the project as Grohl toured with the Foo Fighters, getting vocalists on board and organizing tracks. Then the demo tapes were sent to the singers, each of whom was asked to come up with lyrics, record them and then title the song. Cronos detailed he wrote three different versions so Grohl could choose one.

==Production and style==

On the album, Grohl teamed up with heavy metal vocalists from 1980s and 1990s bands who influenced his musical tastes while he was growing up. Similar to 1995&#x27;s &quot;Foo Fighters&quot;, Grohl wrote all of the music and performed most of the instrumentation. Each track on the album features a different lead singer including Lemmy, Max Cavalera, King Diamond and Tom Warrior. Grohl described the sequencing as &quot;like a compilation tape that I would have made as a kid.&quot;

Only Lemmy and Wino visited Studio 606 to record, with all the others sending tapes from studio to studio until the album was finished. Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil plays additional guitar on two tracks thanks to Kasper, who had brought the Probot tapes to Seattle and they attracted Thayil&#x27;s interest. Grohl was pleased with the addition as Thayil had more experience with lead guitars, while Grohl was &quot;more about the riff and the rhythm&quot;. A bonus track titled &quot;I Am The Warlock&quot; was provided by comedian/actor/musician Jack Black. According to Black, who described the song as &quot;a homage to &#x27;Iron Man.&#x27;&quot; after Grohl approached him regarding writing lyrics, his spouse Tanya Haden suggested &quot;it should be about a fucked up relationship,&quot; so Black made it about a warlock.

Grohl also approached death metal legend Chuck Schuldiner of Death to contribute to Probot. However, Schuldiner was struggling with brain cancer and was unable to be involved despite the efforts of Grohl and others to raise funds for his medical treatment. Grohl also attempted to get Slayer&#x27;s lead singer Tom Araya on the album, but he was unable due to scheduling conflicts. To replace him, Grohl invited Kurt Brecht from D.R.I. Grohl mentioned he and Sweeney had discussed and considered a lot of different singers, including the retired Jeff Becerra of Possessed, Chuck Billy from Testament, Pantera&#x27;s Phil Anselmo, and the vocalists from Kreator, Destruction, Hirax and Candlemass. Sweeney vetoed Unleashed&#x27;s Johnny Hedlund, who at the time was rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.

In a 2007 interview for &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, Grohl was asked about the future of Probot. He explained that the idea behind Probot was to choose his favorite vocalists that inspired him when he was a teenager. Grohl said that he does not think that he will do it again, because he does not want to go outside of that idea.

==Release==
Despite Grohl&#x27;s label Roswell having a deal with RCA Records, he knew such an unorthodox project featuring cult musicians of the past would not be easily accepted by major labels. RCA was interested at first, but later Grohl decided to follow the spirit of the original bands &quot;on independent, punk-rock do it yourself labels.&quot; So Grohl&#x27;s friend Pete Stahl, with whom he had played in Scream and was then in the band Goatsnake, suggested the label of his bandmate Greg Anderson, the smaller metal-based Southern Lord Records.

The album is available as a single CD and a double LP (available on red and black vinyl). Southern Lord released a double A-sided single, &quot;Centuries of Sin/The Emerald Law&quot; in a limited edition of 6,666 on 7&quot; vinyl only. It is available on black, green, red &amp; red/black swirl vinyl, and sold out shortly after release. The album artwork was created by musician Away (Michel Langevin) of Voivod.

==Reception==

Critical reception to the Probot album was largely positive with few recurring complaints; Metacritic shows a 72/100 critic rating based on 21 reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared it as &quot;the year&#x27;s first great metal album,&quot; while &quot;Blender&quot; reported, &quot;Unlike similar records... this has a unity of aesthetic purpose, a competitive wallop, even (kind of) a seriousness.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Probot&quot; a B− rating. He notes, &quot;For a lark, it aims for (and hits) a few bull&#x27;s-eyes, including the whiplashing &#x27;The Emerald Law&#x27; and the post-apocalyptic death march &#x27;Ice Cold Man&#x27;.&quot; However, Browne comments how the mystery and thrill of vintage metal bands is &quot;largely gone&quot; with many lyrics on &quot;Probot&quot; sounding &quot;more amusing than menacing&quot; and even &quot;unintentionally funny.&quot; He sums it up as &quot;lying somewhere between homage and howler.&quot;

&quot;Probot&quot; earned an A rating in &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine as well as the title of StylusMagazine.com&#x27;s Album of the Week for February 8–14, 2004. Scott McKeating&#x27;s extensive review describes how &quot;Probot balances the grit with the sonic polish without lapsing into Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Metallica&quot;. This is metal that demands banging, shaking and stamping.&quot; He commends the ambition of its overall conception, noting, &quot;Very few [artists] go as far as Grohl and actually create something vital and new in their mid-thirties from their teenage obsessions. . . &quot;Probot&quot; is an inspirational record in every sense.&quot;

Adrien Begrand of PopMatters describes it as &quot;One of the coolest ideas for an album in a long time, Grohl has put together a record that not only serves as a sincere tribute to the metal and hardcore bands of his youth, but features all his favorite vocalists as well.&quot; He gave a favorable review but heavily discussed Grohl&#x27;s guitar skills and songwriting as lacking: &quot;The biggest problem on the album is Grohl&#x27;s complete lack of inventiveness as a guitar player. . . Had Dave Grohl used more guest musicians instead of trying to do everything himself, &quot;Probot&quot; would have been much better.&quot; Despite these criticisms, Begrand considers it &quot;impossible not to like this album, mistakes and all.&quot;

Awarding a 4/5 rating, Allmusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson emphasizes the wide variety of genres featured on &quot;Probot&quot; and adds, &quot;Whatever the style of metal that he is embracing, Grohl&#x27;s drumming is passionate throughout this fine album, which is as rewarding as it is unpredictable.&quot;

==&quot;Shake Your Blood&quot;==
Although Grohl recorded the guitar and drums himself, Lemmy performed his own bass and wrote the lyrics to &quot;Shake Your Blood&quot;. He noted, &quot;I wrote the lyrics in about ten minutes. . . It&#x27;s rock &amp; roll, you know. It&#x27;s not one of those complicated things.&quot; The song bears strong resemblance to Lemmy&#x27;s style and was considered &quot;a terrific Motörhead clone&quot; by Adrien Begrand of PopMatters.

The &quot;Shake Your Blood&quot; music video was filmed in November 2003 and released shortly thereafter. It features an appearance by 66 women from the SuicideGirls adult entertainment website. The music video also appears on the extras section on the movie SuicideGirls: The First Tour. In the video, the band is represented with Dave Grohl on drums, Lemmy on lead vocals and bass, and Wino (who sang on the Probot track &quot;The Emerald Law&quot;) on lead guitar. Lemmy regarded the performance as &quot;just like a tour in the &#x27;60s, when things were a lot more fun.&quot;

==Live performances==
Foo Fighters performed &quot;Shake Your Blood&quot; live with Lemmy at their 2006 Hyde Park (UK) show, and on June 18, 2011, at Foo Fighters concert in Berlin. &quot;My Tortured Soul&quot; was performed live on &quot;Headbangers&#x27; Ball&quot; in 2004, with Eric Wagner on lead vocals, Grohl on drums, Wino on lead guitar, Greg Anderson (of Goatsnake and Sunn O)))) on rhythm guitar, and Foo Fighters producer Nick Raskulinecz on bass guitar. This performance is available on the compilation album &quot;MTV2 Headbangers Ball, Vol. 2&quot;. Soulfly has also been known to play &quot;Red War&quot; live as recently as 2009. &quot;Ice Cold Man&quot; has also been played by Cathedral on their 2004 tour. &quot;Centuries of Sin&quot; has also been played by Venom on their 2009 tour in South America.

<text>Sir Christopher John Chataway (31 January 1931 – 19 January 2014) was a British middle- and long-distance runner, television news broadcaster and Conservative politician.

==Education==
Chataway was born in Chelsea, London, the son of James Denys Percival Chataway (died 1953) and Margaret Pritchard, née Smith (died 1988). He spent his childhood in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan as his father was a district commissioner in the Sudan Political Service. He was educated at Sherborne School — where he excelled at rugby, boxing and gymnastics but did not win a race until he was 16. — and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he gained a philosophy, politics and economics degree, His studies were outshone by his success on the athletics track as a long-distance runner.

==Athletics career==
Chataway had a short but distinguished athletics career. At the Helsinki Olympic Games of 1952, in the 5000 metres final, after being passed on the last bend by the Czech long-distance runner, Emil Zátopek, France&#x27;s Alain Mimoun, and West Germany&#x27;s Herbert Schade, Chataway&#x27;s foot brushed the curb and he crashed headlong to the ground. Chataway managed to finish the race in fifth place. On leaving university he took an executive job with Guinness. When Sir Hugh Beaver of Guinness came up with the idea for the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, it was Chataway who suggested his old university friends Norris and Ross McWhirter as editors, knowing of their liking for facts.

Chataway continued with his running. When Roger Bannister ran the first sub-four-minute mile on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University&#x27;s Iffley Road Track, Chataway and Chris Brasher were his pacemakers. He finished in second place in the 5000m at the European Athletics Championship of 1954, 12.2 seconds behind the winner Vladimir Kuts, but two weeks later turned the tables at a London v. Moscow athletics competition at White City, setting a world record time of 13 minutes 51.6 seconds. The contest was televised via the Eurovision network and made Chataway a sporting celebrity: that December he won the first BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. After competing in the 1956 Olympics, Chataway retired from international athletics, though he continued to race for Thames Hare and Hounds.

==Broadcasting and politics==
Soon after leaving Oxford with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics, he decided to aim for a political career. He thought a suitable job in the rapidly expanding world of television might help. He refused offers in sports TV and with panel and quiz shows but secured a job in August 1955 with ITN. He, Robin Day, and Barbara Mandell, were its first newscasters. After six months, when loss-making ITV cut back on its news output, Chataway switched to the BBC and was for three and a half years one of &quot;Panorama&quot;″s team of reporters with a different assignment each week, sometimes at home but usually abroad. By this time, he was also considering another career, this time in politics. He had been narrowly elected as a Conservative to the London County Council in 1958 in Lewisham North, and was then selected to stand for Parliament in the same seat. Lewisham North was a highly marginal seat won by Labour in a by-election in 1957, but Chataway won the seat with a majority bigger than it had been in the previous general election.

His maiden speech expressed the hope that the England cricket team would refuse to play a tour in apartheid South Africa, a highly unusual opinion for a Conservative. In Parliament, Chataway took up the issue of refugees, especially in Africa, and campaigned so hard during World Refugee Year that he was awarded a Nansen Medal. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary before being appointed as a junior Education Minister in July 1962. In the 1964 election, his majority was slashed to 343 and the seat looked distinctly vulnerable; in 1966 he lost.

===ILEA===
In 1967 the Conservatives unexpectedly won control of the Inner London Education Authority and the party leadership was horrified to discover that their newly elected councillors were going to try to break up comprehensive schools and replace them with secondary modern and grammar schools. Chataway, with relevant ministerial experience, was persuaded to take over. He was elected an alderman and appointed leader of the education committee. Eventually cajoling his colleagues into a more moderate line, he avoided a head-on collision with Edward Short (the Labour Education Secretary) and proceeded with those schemes for secondary reorganisation that he regarded as well founded.

===Heath government===
Chataway was keen to return to Parliament, and the opportunity came in a byelection in Chichester in May 1969. He then resigned as ILEA Leader. With the return of a Conservative government in 1970, and after refusing the offer of sports minister, he was appointed by Edward Heath as Minister for Posts and Telecommunications and made a privy counsellor. In this post he took charge of introducing commercial radio for the first time, ending the BBC monopoly. He also introduced to parliament the complete end to the restrictions on broadcasting hours on television and radio. The restrictions on broadcasting hours were gradually eased from early 1971 and lifted fully in January 1972. After a reshuffle in April 1972 he was Minister for Industrial Development.

==Business career==
When the Conservatives were defeated in the February 1974 election, Chataway announced his retirement from politics (at the age of 43) and did not seek re-election in October 1974. He then went into business becoming a managing director of Orion Bank, a consortium bank later acquired by one of its shareholders, the Royal Bank of Canada. He stayed with Orion, later as vice chairman, for 15 years. He held various non-executive directorships and was also the first chairman of Groundwork, the environmental charity, and hon. treasurer of the National Campaign for Electoral Reform.

His principal outside interest was ActionAid, a small overseas development charity, of which he became treasurer in 1974 and later chairman. By the time he left the board of trustees in 1999 ActionAid&#x27;s annual turnover had grown to nearly £100 million. When Chataway&#x27;s son Adam decided to launch a water project in Ethiopia in memory of his fiancée killed in a road traffic accident he chose to do it in partnership with ActionAid. Vicky&#x27;s Water Project, opened in 2010, has transformed the lives of 20,000 people.

In 1991 Chataway was appointed chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority – a job he relished not least because his father had been one of the early aviators. He supported his friend Chris Brasher when he established the London Marathon, and was President of the Commonwealth Games Council for England from 1990 to 2009. He was knighted in the 1995 Birthday Honours for services to the aviation industry.

In the 2005 general election his stepson Charles Walker was elected as Conservative MP for Broxbourne.

==Personal life==
He was married twice; firstly, to Anna Lett (1959; divorced 1975), with whom he had two sons and a daughter; and secondly, to Carola Walker (1976 to his death), with whom he had two further sons.

His stepson is the Conservative MP Charles Walker and his brother-in-law the former Conservative MP Peter Hordern.

==Death==
Chataway suffered from cancer for the last two and a half years of his life. He died at St John&#x27;s Hospice in north west London on 19 January 2014, twelve days before his 83rd birthday.

<text>Maria Antonina Boniecka (19 June 1910 – 19 June 1978) was a Polish author and teacher, who also served in the Polish Home Army during the Second World War. She received several awards, including the Silver Cross of Merit, the Home Army Cross, the Szczecin Literary Award, and a Gold Award from the Towarzystwo Wiedzy Powszechnej (Society for Universal Knowledge). Opposed to Communism, she was persecuted by the Polish government of the time; among other things, she lost her position as editor of the periodical &quot;Ziemia i Morze&quot; and was taken to court over an article published therein. She emigrated to Australia in 1965, where she wrote her memoir, &quot;Ucieczka za Druty&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Boniecka studied in Warsaw where she finished a degree in pedagogy in 1934, and then obtained a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 1937. From 1928 Boniecka worked as a teacher in adult education in Warsaw, and in 1937 she was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit for her work with illiterate adults.

Boniecka spent the occupation in Warsaw. Though she served the resistance from 1940, she officially joined the Polish Home Army in 1942, and was later awarded the Home Army Cross.

During 1946–1949, Boniecka taught Polish at a secondary school, and was in charge of the student literary circle, one of whose members was Włodzimierz Odojewski, who was to become a distinguished author and who, like Boniecka, would emigrate. In 1959 she received the Szczecin Literary Award. Up until 1963 she delivered lectures on various subjects including literary history, earning her a Gold Award from the Towarzystwo Wiedzy Powszechnej (Society for Universal Knowledge) in 1960.

During the political &quot;thaw&quot; known as Polish October, Boniecka was chosen to be the first editor of the socio-literary weekly &quot;Ziemia i Morze&quot; (Land and Sea) in the city of Szczecin. In 1957, she was removed from this position &quot;in absentia&quot;, for &quot;political transgressions regarding the issue of Hungary, censorship, elections, inadequate condemnation of erroneous tendencies, failing to consult with the State Committee (KW) in regards to editorial politics, failing to bring the publication in line with the party line...&quot;. A few weeks after losing her job, Boniecka was taken to court over an article she published in &quot;Ziemia i Morze&quot; which exposed the appalling conditions existing in the local education system. The court found in favour of Boniecka.

As time progressed, the efforts of the communist state to intimidate Boniecka increased. In 1960, the party confiscated a number of her manuscripts. In 1963 she was placed on a blacklist preventing her from being published and from giving lectures, and in 1964 her pension was revoked, effectively depriving her of income. Also in 1963 an unruly tenant, backed by the communist party, took up residence in her home, verbally and physically abusing Boniecka and her family. In an effort to get the man evicted, she took him to court in 1964, but the proceedings dragged on until 1966 (finding in her favour), by which time she had left the country. In 1964 she tried to take her own life, but was medically revived.

In 1965 Boniecka succeeded in an attempt to leave the country. Together with her husband and daughter, she emigrated to Australia to join her other children. She subsequently published in various Polish-language publications on political subjects, both in Australia and abroad. Her last book, &quot;Ucieczka za Druty&quot; (Escape across the [barbed] wire), a work of creative non-fiction, was written in Sydney, and published in London in 1975.

<text>Treejumping is a form of parachuting, into a forest or jungle – typically, from a relatively low altitude. It is generally considered to be a particularly dangerous form of parachuting. Treejumping is also especially damaging to the parachuting equipment.

The technique was pioneered by the British Special Air Service Regiment in 1951 during the Malayan Emergency, when insertion into dense jungle was required to combat the insurgents of the Malayan National Liberation Army. Soldiers carried a 30-metre rope to enable them to abseil down from the forest canopy.

In the United States Army, there is one company of combat engineers, Bravo Company of the 27th Engineer Battalion (Combat)(Airborne), trained to intentionally jump into forested areas in order to create drop zones for follow-on forces. In 2008, the 27th Engineer Battalion (Combat)(Airborne) transformed, changing Bravo Company (Combat)(Airborne)(Rough Terrain) to the 57th Engineer Company (Airborne)(Sapper)(Rough Terrain).

==Recent Rough Terrain Operations==
On October 27, 2011, 37 Soldiers from the 57th EN CO exited a C-23 Sherpa over Luzon Tree Drop Zone, located in Fort Bragg, NC. Three Soldiers from the 161st Engineer Support Company also participated in the jump. The 161st ESC also supported the Rough Terrain operation by providing a large detail to recover parachutes stuck amongst the trees. CPT Benjamin Shean, Commander of the 57th EN CO, performed duties as the Airborne Commander and primary jumpmaster on the first and fourth pass.

Most paratroopers landed within the boundaries of the drop zone and assembled in the South East corner of Luzon Tree Drop Zone. Numerous soldiers who landed in the trees found themselves suspended up to 40 feet above the ground. These soldiers rappelled to the ground by securing a letdown line to the risers of their MC1-1 steerable parachute.

The Rough Terrain operation on 27 October was the first such operation conducted by the 57th Engineer Company since 2009. The purpose and intent of the Rough Terrain operation was to demonstrate the ability to land in a tree drop zone, and the proficiency to do so safely. The 57th Engineer Company is planning multiple Rough Terrain operations in 2012 in order to build proficiency, certify more soldiers as Rough Terrain, and continue to train the full spectrum of Rough Terrain operations. Training for the Rough Terrain operation was conducted at the United States Army Advanced Airborne School in September, 2011.

<text>The Prussian Trust, or Prussian Claims Society, () is a corporation registered in Düsseldorf, founded in 2000 as &quot;Preußische Treuhand GmbH&quot; by some descendants of German expellees, and supported by some officials of the Landsmannschaft Schlesien organization. It seeks to claim compensation from Poland and the Czech Republic, among others, for property confiscated from Germans expelled from territories which after World War II became parts of Poland and Czechoslovakia.

The chairman of the supervisory board is Rudi Pawelka, who also is president of the Landsmannschaft Schlesien, and vice president is Hans Günther Parplies, also vice president of the Federation of Expellees. The Trust probably has fewer than a hundred members.

==Compensation claims against Poland==
Rudi Pawelka told the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on 15 February 2004 that: 
The then-German chancellor Gerhard Schröder stated on 1 August 2004 that the German government will not support these claims. Also, the Polish Sejm declared that Poland will demand war reparations from Germany if the German government does not end the press for compensations. Some German politicians stated that the claims by the Sejm were ridiculous and had no legal basis. The corporation&#x27;s activities have been repudiated by some German politicians who have addressed the issue, including the president of the Federation of Expellees, Erika Steinbach.

In December 2006, the corporation filed 23 individual claims against Poland in the European Court of Human Rights, an action which has been condemned by both the Polish and German governments.

The Polish government decided that the submissions warranted a comment by Anna Fotyga, the Polish Minister of the Foreign Affairs who &quot;express [her] deepest concern upon receiving the information about a claim against Poland submitted by the Prussian Trust to the European Court of Human Rights&quot;.
On 9 October 2008 the European Court of Human Rights declared the case of &quot;Preussische Treuhand v. Poland &quot; inadmissible, because of the non-retroactivity of the European Convention on Human Rights:

<doc id="583014" wikidata="Q1967496" url="?curid=583014" title="National Museum of Australia">
<text>The National Museum of Australia (NMA), in the national capital Canberra, preserves and interprets Australia&#x27;s social history, exploring the key issues, people and events that have shaped the nation. It was formally established by the &quot;National Museum of Australia Act 1980&quot;.

The museum profiles 50,000 years of Indigenous heritage, settlement since 1788 and key events including Federation and the Sydney 2000 Olympics. It holds the world&#x27;s largest collection of Aboriginal bark paintings and stone tools, the heart of champion racehorse Phar Lap and the Holden prototype No. 1 car. The museum also develops and travels exhibitions on subjects ranging from bushrangers to surf lifesaving. The National Museum of Australia Press publishes a wide range of books, catalogues and journals. The museum&#x27;s Research Centre takes a cross-disciplinary approach to history, ensuring the museum is a lively forum for ideas and debate about Australia&#x27;s past, present and future.

The museum&#x27;s innovative use of new technologies has been central to its growing international reputation in outreach programming, particularly with regional communities. From 2003 to 2008, the museum hosted &quot;Talkback Classroom&quot;, a student political forum.

The museum did not have a permanent home until 11 March 2001, when a purpose-built museum building was officially opened. It is located on Acton Peninsula in the suburb of Acton, next to the Australian National University. The peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin was previously the home of the Royal Canberra Hospital, which was demolished in tragic circumstances on 13 July 1997.

==Architecture==


As designed by architect Howard Raggatt (design architect and design director for the project), the museum building is based on a theme of knotted ropes, symbolically bringing together the stories of Australians. The architects stated: &quot;We liked to think that the story of Australia was not one, but many tangled together. Not an authorized version but a puzzling confluence; not merely the resolution of difference but its wholehearted embrace.&quot; The building is meant to be the centre of a knot, with trailing ropes or strips extending from the building. The most obvious of these extensions forms a large loop before becoming a walkway which extends past the neighbouring AIATSIS building ending in a large curl, as if a huge ribbon has haphazardly unrolled itself along the ground. Known as the &quot;Uluru Axis&quot; because it aligns with the central Australian natural landmark, the ribbon symbolically integrates the site with the Canberra city plan by Walter Burley Griffin and the spiritual heart of indigenous Australia.

The shape of the main entrance hall continues this theme: it is as though the otherwise rectangular building has been built encasing a complex knot which does not quite fit inside the building, and then the knot taken away. The entirely non-symmetrical complex is designed to not look like a museum, with startling colours and angles, unusual spaces and unpredictable projections and textures.

Though hard to precisely categorise, the building can be seen as an example of Charles Jencks&#x27; &quot;new paradigm&quot;. Some characteristics of Deconstructivism can also be identified.

The organising concept of the scheme using the idea of a &quot;tangled vision&quot; incorporates a variety of references including:
*Bea Maddock&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy Tape&quot;
*Jackson Pollock&#x27;s &quot;Blue Poles&quot;
*Boolean string, a knot, and Ariadne&#x27;s thread
*The Aboriginal Dreamtime story of the Rainbow Serpent making the land.

The building&#x27;s architecture is thus meant to imply that the story of Australia is not one story, but many stories tangled together. The building also refers to or quotes other buildings:
*A Burley-Griffin designed cloister at Newman College, Melbourne
*The Sydney Opera Houseboth the parts designed by Jørn Utzon, and sections designed by the other architects
*The shell curves of Félix Candela
*The Hall is evocative of Eero Saarinen&#x27;s terminal at the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York
*The arc is like a piece of work by Richard Serra
*The Garden of Australian Dreams is meant to evoke a range of different cartographies
*The walls use selected fragments of the word &#x27;Eternity&#x27;evoking the story of Arthur Stace who for thirty years chalked this single word on the pavements of Sydney
*The most controversial quotation is a reference to the Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s Jewish Museum Berlin, Germany which opened in 1999

The plan of the National Museum of Australia incorporates an exact copy of the lightning-flash zigzag that Libeskind created for the Berlin Museum by breaking a star of David. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine first publicly raised allegations of plagiarism in June 2000. Libeskind was reported to be angry with the copying. Raggatt&#x27;s defence against plagiarism was that the design was a quotation rather than a copy. The director of the museum, Dawn Casey, stated that she and her council were not aware of this symbolism when they approved the plan.

The exterior of the building is covered in anodised aluminium panels. Many of the panels include words written in braille and other decorative devices. Among the messages are &quot;mate&quot; and &quot;she&#x27;ll be right&quot;. Also included were such controversial words and phrases as &quot;sorry&quot; and &quot;forgive us our genocide&quot;. These more controversial messages have been obscured with silver discs being attached to the surface making the braille illegible.

Among the phrases in braille are the words &quot;Resurrection city&quot;. The phrase may refer to the clearing of the former Canberra Hospital to make way for the museum or it could be a reference to reconciliation between Indigenous Australians and European settlers. The phrase is used as a label in tiles on another of Raggett&#x27;s buildings, the Storey Hall in Melbourne. Raggett says of that message: &quot;I guess that tries to be some big sort of theme for this building as well and its sort of set of memories.&quot;

It was built by Bovis Lend Lease and completed in 2001.

Art critic Christopher Allen described it as &quot;undoubtedly the ugliest example of official architecture in Australia... a painful example of inept, clumsy and gratuitous form justified by kitsch symbolism&quot;.

===Hail storm damage===

A severe thunderstorm hit Canberra on the afternoon of 29 December 2006 and caused roof damage to the administration section of the museum. The ceiling collapsed under the weight of hail. The damage exposed power cables and left two centimetres of water on the floor. The water also damaged several paintings by a Sydney artist which were associated with an exhibition about Australian lifesavers. However, the main part of the building was unaffected and nothing from the museum&#x27;s collection was damaged. The building was re-opened to the public a day later. The damage was expected to cost at least A$500,000 to repair.
===Building works 2012/13===
In 2012, building works commenced on a new cafe and administration wing.

The new cafe opened in late 2012. It overlooks Lake Burley Griffin and offers both indoor and outdoor dining. The relocation of the museum&#x27;s cafe freed up the vast entry Hall for the display of large objects from the museum&#x27;s collection, including vehicles.

The new administration wing, which links the main building with the existing administration building, was completed in mid-2013. The new building is clad in brightly coloured tiles arranged in a QR code pattern.

== Collection ==

The museum&#x27;s collection, known as the National Historical Collection, includes over 210,000 objects. The collection focuses on three themes: the culture and history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, Australian history and culture since European settlement in 1788, and interactions between people and the Australian environment. Notable objects (as identified by the museum on their website) include:
* Various items relating to the death of Azaria Chamberlain, including a yellow Holden Torana (later sold to the museum by Dr Michael Chamberlain.)
* Bicycles owned by Australian cyclist and winner of the 2011 Tour de France, Cadel Evans
* Navigational instruments used by Captain James Cook
* Medical equipment used by Fred Hollows
* A Holey Dollar, the first currency minted in Australia
* Netball memorabilia of Liz Ellis
* Olympic medals won by John Konrads at the 1960 Rome Olympics
* Props from children&#x27;s television show Play School
* An Australian flag found in the ruins of World Trade Center Three after the September 11 attacks
* The fleece of Chris the sheep

The museum also functions as a temporary repository for the repatriation of ancestral remains. It is involved in projects to return the remains of indigenous Australians, held in the collections of museums across the world, to their communities of origin. These projects have seen the return of over 1,400 remains as of March 2019.

==Past exhibitions==
=== &quot;Songlines: Tracking the Seven Sisters&quot;===

On 15 September 2017, the exhibition &quot;Songlines: Tracking the Seven Sisters&quot;, referencing the creation myth of the Seven Sisters that is common to many groups in the Western and Central Deserts, was launched at the NMA. It was instigated by aṉangu people, and was a collaboration with Aboriginal elders who are custodians of the Dreamtime story. The exhibition included a huge painting called &quot;Yarrkalpa — Hunting Ground&quot;, which symbolically depicts the area around Parnngurr in Western Australia, showing the seasons, cultural burning practices and Indigenous management of the land and natural resources. In June 2022, the work was projected onto the Sydney Opera House as part of the Vivid Sydney festival.

The exhibition ran until February 2018, and travelled to Berlin, Germany, in 2022 and is due to be shown in Paris, France, in 2023.

<text>Boyd Blake Rice (born December 16, 1956) is an American experimental sound/noise musician using the name of NON since the mid-1970s. A pioneer of industrial music, Rice was one of the first artists to use a sampler and turntable as an instrument. He is also a writer, archivist, actor, and photographer.

==Biography==
Rice was born on December 16, 1956, in Lemon Grove, California. He became widely known through his involvement in V. Vale&#x27;s RE/Search Publications. He is profiled in RE/Search #6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook and &quot;Pranks!&quot; 

In the mid-1980s Rice became close friends with Anton LaVey, founder and of the Church of Satan, and was made a priest, then later a magister in the Council of Nine of the Church. The two admired much of the same music and shared a similar misanthropic outlook. Each had been inspired by &quot;Might Is Right&quot; in fashioning various works: LaVey in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, and Rice in several recordings.

In 1987 Rice and Nikolas Schreck founded the Abraxas Foundation, an &quot;occult-fascist&quot; think tank that also counted Adam Parfrey and Michael J. Moynihan among its members. During an interview, Rice described the basic philosophy of his foundation as being &quot;The strong rule the weak, and the clever rule the strong&quot;.

Rice has documented the writings of Charles Manson in his role as contributing editor of &quot;The Manson File&quot;.

==Music==
Rice creates music under his own name, as well as under the moniker of NON and with contributors under various other project names.

===Early sound experiments===
Rice started creating experimental noise recordings in 1975, drawing on his interest in tape machines and bubblegum pop sung by female vocalists such as Little Peggy March and Ginny Arnell. One of his earliest efforts consisted entirely of a loop of every time Lesley Gore sang the word &quot;cry&quot;. After initially creating recordings simply for his own listening, he later started to give performances, and eventually make records. His musical project NON grew out of these early experiments; he reportedly selected the name because &quot;it implies everything and nothing&quot;.

===Techniques and implementations===
From his earliest recordings, Rice has experimented with both sound and the medium through which that sound is conveyed. His methods of expanding upon the listening possibilities for recorded music were simple. On his second seven-inch, he had 2–4 extra holes punched into the record for &quot;multi axial rotation&quot;. Another early LP was titled &quot;Play at Any Speed&quot;. While working exclusively with vinyl, he employed locked grooves that allowed listeners to create their own music. He was one of the first artists, after John Cage, to treat turntables as instruments and developed various techniques for scratching. Rice has been treating sounds from vinyl recordings as early as 1975.

===NON===
Under the name NON, originally with second member Robert Turman, Rice has recorded several seminal noise music albums, and collaborated with experimental music/dark folk artists like Current 93, Death in June and Rose McDowall. Most of his music has been released on the Mute Records label. Rice has also collaborated with Frank Tovey of Fad Gadget, Tony Wakeford of Sol Invictus and Michael Jenkins Moynihan of Blood Axis. His later albums have often been explicitly conceptual.

On &quot;Might!&quot; (1995), Rice layers portions of Ragnar Redbeard&#x27;s Social Darwinist harangue, &quot;Might Is Right&quot; over sound beds of looped noise and manipulated frequencies. 1997&#x27;s &quot;God &amp; Beast&quot; explores the intersection in the soul of man&#x27;s physical and spiritual natures over the course of an album that alternates abrasive soundscapes with passages of tranquility.

In 2006, Rice returned to the studio to record raw vocal sound sources for a collaboration with Industrial, modern primitive percussionist/ethnomusicologist Z&#x27;EV. In addition, he and long-time friend of twenty years Giddle Partridge planned an album titled &quot;LOVE/LOVE-BANG/BANG!&quot;, under the band name of Giddle &amp; Boyd. After the limited edition release of a bubblegum pink, heart-shaped vinyl E.P. titled, &quot;Going Steady With Peggy Moffitt&quot;. In early 2010, Rice announced that he and Giddle Partridge would focus on solo projects/albums for the time being.

===Crowd control===
Early NON performances were designed to offer choice to audience members who might otherwise expect only a prefabricated and totally passive entertainment experience. Rice has stated that he considers his performances to be &quot;de-indoctrination rites&quot;. Rice has performed using a shoe polisher, the &quot;rotoguitar&quot; (an electric guitar with an electric fan on it), and other homemade instruments. He has also used found sounds, played at a volume just below the threshold of pain, to entice his audiences to endure his high decibel sound experiments.

Rice coupled his aural assaults with psychological torture on audiences in The Hague, the Netherlands, by shining in their faces exceedingly bright lights that were deliberately placed just out of reach. As their frustration mounted, Rice states that he:
==Other work==
After dropping out of high school at the age of 17, Rice began an in-depth study of early 20th-century art movements, producing his own abstract black and white paintings and experimental photographs. Early on, he met European art historian and gallery owner Arturo Schwarz, with whom he began a long correspondence. Schwarz, a biographer of Duchamp and Man Ray, encouraged Rice to pursue his art, no matter what. And he did. Though he would later shift his focus to sound, he has never stopped creating visual art and has given a number of one man shows over the years.

In the mid-1970s Rice devoted a great deal of time to experimental photography, developing a process by which he could produce &quot;photographs of things which don&#x27;t exist&quot;. He had a one-man show of the photos in the early 1980s at Richard Peterson&#x27;s Pink &amp; Pearl Gallery in San Diego, which was documented in the local press, the &quot;San Diego Union&quot; and &quot;Evening Tribune&quot;. He has never revealed the means by which he made these photos, and has stated publicly that the secret will go to the grave with him. Some of these photos can be seen in his book &quot;Standing in Two Circles&quot; (Creation Press, 2008).

==Personal life==
Rice dated Lisa Crystal Carver, with whom he has a son, Wolfgang.

Rice was arrested in 1995 for domestic violence, though never charged. Carver writes in her memoir, &quot;Drugs Are Nice&quot;, that he physically abused her. 

==Views==
Since the 1980s Rice&#x27;s music and art have been influenced by fascist and otherwise transgressive ideas and aesthetics. The packaging for NON&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Blood &amp; Flame&quot;, for instance, included a Wolfsangel and a quote from Alfred Rosenberg. He has often been accused of fascist sympathies as a result. He also cultivated connections with neo-Nazis such as James Mason (who he began corresponding with in 1986), Tom Metzger (whose TV show he appeared on in 1986) and Bob Heick. Rice introduced Mason to Adam Parfrey and Michael J. Moynihan, who would bring Mason&#x27;s book &quot;Siege&quot; to a larger audience. In 1989, Rice and Heick were photographed for &quot;Sassy&quot; wearing uniforms and brandishing knives. He has also expressed support for fascism in his writings, interviews, and public appearances. 

Rice began to face a backlash for these associations in the late 1980s, when more left-wing avant-garde figures like Jello Biafra, Peter Christopherson, and V. Vale cut their ties with him. In the 1990s he began to disassociate himself from the far right and to use fascist iconography with more irony.

Rice has denied that he is a neo-Nazi. In one 2012 interview he praised Arthur de Gobineau while adding, “I don’t think that to believe in the principle of natural inequality that necessarily equates to: you hate black people or you hate Jews or something.” In another 2019 interview he described himself as &quot;utterly apolitical.&quot; A 2018 art show was cancelled because of protests over Rice&#x27;s fascist associations, as were some shows on Rice&#x27;s 2013 tour with Cold Cave.

<doc id="583025" wikidata="Q243121" url="?curid=583025" title="Gretchen Franklin">
<text>Gretchen Franklin (7 July 1911 – 11 July 2005) was an English actress and dancer with a career in show business spanning over 70 years. She played Ethel Skinner in the long-running BBC 1 soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; on a regular basis from 1985 until 1988. After this she returned to the show intermittently. These appearances became briefer and more widely spaced. Her final appearance was in 2000, when her character was killed off.

== Early life ==
Gretchen Gordon Franklin was born in Covent Garden, Central London, into a theatrical family, the only child of her parents Gordon and Violet Franklin. Her father had a song-and-dance act, while her grandfather was a well-known music-hall entertainer at the turn of the 20th century. Her younger cousin was the comedian Clive Dunn (1920-2012).

Franklin entered show business as a teenager, making her début as a pantomime chorus girl in Bournemouth. In 1929, she took dancing lessons at the &quot;Theatre Girls Club&quot; in Soho in London&#x27;s West End and she later became a tap dancer and founder member of a quartet known as &quot;Four Brilliant Blondes&quot;. Franklin was a Tiller Girl, known for their high kicks, at the London Palladium.

Franklin toured in variety with the comedians Syd and Max Harrison and on the &quot;Gracie Fields Show&quot;, and performed with another dance group, &quot;The Three Girlies&quot;, before making a gradual switch to straight dramatic roles.

== Acting career ==
Franklin&#x27;s break came during the Second World War when she was cast in &quot;Sweet and Low&quot;, the first of a series of highly successful West End revues. Staged at the New Ambassadors Theatre, the revues starred Hermione Gingold. Franklin and Gingold became close friends and were reunited in another revue, &quot;Slings &amp; Arrows&quot; (Comedy Theatre, 1948).

Franklin also appeared in several plays and made one of her early screen appearances in &quot;Before I Wake&quot; (1955). Her other films included &quot;Cloak Without Dagger&quot; (1956), &quot;Flame in the Streets&quot; (1961), &quot;Ticket to Paradise (1961 film)&quot;, &quot;The Murder Game&quot; (1965), &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (1968), &quot;The Night Visitor&quot; (1971), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), &quot;Quincy&#x27;s Quest&quot; (1979), and &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), among others.

Franklin appeared in several productions for the BBC and on stage. One of Franklin&#x27;s best known stage roles was playing Mrs Roper in the 1958 play &quot;Verdict&quot; by British mystery writer Agatha Christie. It was produced by Peter Saunders and directed by Charles Hickman, and ran for 250 performances.

Franklin was acting on stage in the West End in &quot;Spring and Port Wine&quot; in 1965 when she was cast as the first Mrs Alf Garnett in a pilot episode of &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, with Warren Mitchell. However, she missed the chance to become a permanent part in what was to become a successful series – because she couldn&#x27;t obtain her release from her stage role (unable to take a regular role in the series, it was Franklin who recommended her friend Dandy Nichols for the part in the series). Franklin and Nichols have cameo parts in two films directed by Richard Lester, the Beatles film &quot;Help!&quot; (1965) and &quot;How I Won the War&quot; (1967) which stars John Lennon.

Franklin later had regular roles in several television series, including &quot;Crossroads&quot;, in which she played Myrtle Cavendish (later Harvey); the short-lived soap &quot;Castle Haven&quot;; the sitcom &quot;George and Mildred&quot; as Mildred&#x27;s mother, Mrs Tremble, and &quot;Rising Damp&quot; as Rigsby&#x27;s Aunt Maud. She was also a regular supporting figure on television dramas such as &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; and &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. She appeared with Eartha Kitt in an episode of the British espionage series &quot;The Protectors&quot; (&quot;A Pocket Full of Posies&quot;, 1974) performing a song and dance routine. She had bit parts in series such as &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;Follyfoot&quot; and the final &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial in 1979.

Franklin also played the troubled mother Mrs Janes in an episode of the television adaptation of Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;Famous Five&quot; (&quot;Five on Billycock Hill&quot;, 1978) and played the witch Cordelia at the end of the first episode of &quot;The Black Adder&quot; (&quot;The Foretelling&quot;, 1983) starring Rowan Atkinson.

Franklin appeared in an early episode of &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; broadcast in 1990.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
&quot;EastEnders&quot; creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland spent a long time trawling around pubs and street markets in the East End of London, soaking up the atmosphere and making mental notes for when they were to actually create the characters for their show. Smith was very taken with an elderly lady clutching a Yorkshire Terrier dog in one hand and a glass of Guinness in the other, who was clearly the life and soul of the party; Smith saw that there was much comic mileage to be gained from such a character, and as a result Ethel May Skinner was created. In the programme, Ethel was a gossip who did not always get her facts right and this was often used to comic effect, as was her use of malapropisms. However, when Julia Smith announced that the character of Ethel was to go into an old people&#x27;s home, Franklin resigned, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t want Ethel becoming a sad old dear who the others visited occasionally.&quot; She did make return visits to the series, but remained bitter at how her character had been sidelined.

Ethel owned a dog, a pug named Willy. The writers had intended it to be a Yorkshire terrier but a suitable canine could not be found. Franklin was less than pleased to find out that Willy the pug was being chauffeur-driven to the BBC&#x27;s Elstree Studios where &quot;EastEnders&quot; is made, yet she had to travel by bus. Returning to her earlier skills as a Tiller Girl, when Pat Wicks (Pam St Clement) married Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), Franklin provided the high-kicks at the wedding reception – even though she was 78 at the time.

Franklin&#x27;s character departed in 1997 when it was revealed that she had left Walford to live in a retirement village. Franklin returned in July 2000, when her character re-appeared in the show and informed her close friends that she was terminally ill with cancer. She was killed off in the episode which aired on 7 September 2000, in a controversial euthanasia storyline. Ethel had learned that she was terminally ill, and asked Dot Cotton (June Brown) to assist her in taking her own life by an overdose of her morphine tablets.

Franklin&#x27;s departure from &quot;EastEnders&quot; marked the end of her acting career at the age of 89.

==In other media==
Franklin&#x27;s name was mentioned in the lyrics of the song &quot;Telephone Thing&quot; by The Fall. According to lead singer Mark E. Smith, he thought he had &quot;made up the name&quot;, and had not heard of Franklin before.

==Personal life and death==
Franklin was married to writer John Caswell Garth, who was also business manager of the Wilson Barrett acting company and himself an occasional actor, from 1934 until his death from cancer in 1953 at the age of 50. Franklin, who was 42 at the time, never remarried. They had no children.

Off-screen, Franklin devoted much of her later life to charity and gave away all the royalties she received from &quot;EastEnders&quot; repeats to her favourite animal charities. &quot;At my age one isn&#x27;t buying new fur coats and diamonds&quot;, she said. &quot;If you get that lot of repeat fees four times a year you can afford to be a bit more generous to other people.&quot;

In May 2005 at 93 years old, it was announced that Franklin would present the Lifetime Soap Achievement Award to former colleague June Brown at The British Soap Awards; however, she was too ill to attend. It was instead presented to Brown by another &quot;EastEnders&quot; actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale. Wing mentioned Franklin in her speech.

Franklin died at her home in Barnes on 11 July 2005, four days after her 94th birthday. Her life and work were honoured at the BAFTA Television Awards in 2006.

<text>Joseph Edward Cronin (October 12, 1906 – September 7, 1984) was an American professional baseball player, manager and executive. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop, most notably as a member of the Boston Red Sox. Cronin spent over 48 years in baseball, culminating with 14 years as president of the American League (AL).

During his 20-year playing career (1926–1945), Cronin played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox; he was a player-manager for 13 seasons (1933–1945), and served as manager for two additional seasons (1946–1947). A seven-time All-Star, Cronin became the first American League player to become an All-Star with two teams; he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1956.

==Early life==

Cronin was born in the Excelsior District of San Francisco, California. His parents lost almost all of their possessions in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Cronin attended Sacred Heart High School. He played several sports as a child and he won a city tennis championship for his age group when he was 14. As he was not greatly interested in school, Cronin&#x27;s grades improved only when the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League began giving away tickets to students with good conduct and attendance. At the time, the nearest MLB team was nearly from San Francisco.

==Major league career==

===As a player===
Cronin began his major league baseball career playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1926 and 1927. 

Baseball promoter Joe Engel, who scouted for the Washington Senators and managed the Chattanooga Lookouts at Engel Stadium, signed Cronin to the Senators in 1928, after spotting Cronin play in Kansas City. 

In , Cronin ranked 26th in the league for batting average at .346, 35th for home runs with 13, and 13th for RBI with 126. Cronin won both the AL Writers&#x27; MVP (the forerunner of the BBWAA MVP, established in 1931) and the AL Sporting News MVP. In his 1931 season, he posted a .306 average, 12 home runs, and 126 RBIs. Cronin led the Senators to the 1933 World Series and later married Mildred Robertson, the niece of Senators&#x27; owner Clark Griffith. 

===As a player-manager and manager===
Cronin was named player-manager of the Senators in , a post he would hold for two years. In his first year, he led the Senators to what would be their last pennant in Washington.

While Cronin was on his honeymoon with Mildred in his hometown of San Francisco, he received a telegram from Griffith informing him that the Boston Red Sox had offered the Senators their starting shortstop, Lyn Lary, in return for Cronin and $250,000. Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey also offered Cronin a five-year contract as player-manager. Well aware of the Senators&#x27; perennial financial problems (Griffith had no income apart from the Senators), Cronin accepted the trade. Cronin remained as player-manager of the Red Sox until , then continued solely as manager until .

As early as , it was apparent to the Red Sox that Cronin&#x27;s playing career was nearly over. Red Sox farm system director Billy Evans thought he had found Cronin&#x27;s successor in Pee Wee Reese, the star shortstop for the Louisville Colonels of the Triple-A American Association. He was so impressed by Reese that he was able to convince Yawkey to buy the Colonels and make them the Red Sox&#x27; top farm club. However, when Yawkey and Evans asked Cronin to scout Reese, Cronin realized he was scouting his potential replacement. Believing he still had enough left to be a regular player, Cronin deliberately downplayed Reese&#x27;s talent and suggested the Red Sox trade him. Reese was eventually traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he had a Hall of Fame career. As it turned out, Evans and Yawkey&#x27;s concerns about Cronin were valid. His last year as a full-time player was ; after that season he never played more than 76 games per season.

Even when World War II saw many young players either enlist or drafted in the armed services, Cronin limited his playing appearances to cameo roles as a utility infielder and pinch-hitter. On June 17, 1943, Cronin sent himself to pinch hit in both games of a doubleheader and hit a home run each time.

In April 1945, he broke his leg in a game against the Yankees. He sat out the remainder of the season and retired as a player at the end of the year. 

Over his career, Cronin batted .300 or higher eight times, as well as driving in 100 runs or more eight times. He retired with a career .301 average, with 2,285 hits, 515 doubles, 118 triples, 170 home runs, and 1,424 RBIs.

As a manager, he compiled a 1,236–1,055 record and won two American League pennants (in 1933 and 1946). His 1933 Senators lost the 1933 World Series to the New York Giants, and his 1946 Red Sox–the franchise&#x27;s first pennant winner in 28 years–lost the 1946 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals.

===As a general manager===
At the end of the 1947 season, Cronin succeeded Eddie Collins as general manager of the Red Sox and held the post for over 11 years, through mid-January . With Cronin as general manager, the Red Sox competed for the AL pennant in and , finishing second by a single game each season, thanks to Cronin&#x27;s aggressive trades. 

In his first off-season, he acquired shortstop Vern Stephens and pitchers Ellis Kinder and Jack Kramer from the St. Louis Browns; all played major roles for the 1948 Red Sox, who finished the season tied for first place with the Cleveland Indians but lost a tie-breaking playoff game against the Indians for the AL pennant. Kinder and Stephens were centerpieces of the Red Sox&#x27; 1949–1950 contenders as well. In the former year, they were edged out by the Yankees during the regular season&#x27;s final weekend; in the latter, they finished third but came within four games of the league-leading Yanks.

With the exception of Ted Williams (who missed most of the 1952–1953 seasons while serving in the Korean War), the core of the 1946–1950 team aged quickly and the Red Sox faced a significant rebuilding job starting in . Cronin&#x27;s acquisition of future American League Most Valuable Player Jackie Jensen from Washington in represented a coup, but the club misfired on several &quot;bonus babies&quot; who never lived up to their potential. The Red Sox posted winning season records for all but two of Cronin&#x27;s 11 seasons as general manager, but from 1951 through 1958 they lagged behind the AL pennant-winners (except for 1954, the Yankees) by an average of almost 18 games. In January of , Cronin left the team and became American League president. 

By the end of Cronin&#x27;s eleven-year term as general manager, the Red Sox were the only major-league team that had not fielded a black player. During this time, he reportedly made unsuccessful efforts to integrate the team, including attempts to sign or trade for Bill Greason, Larry Doby and Charlie Neal. At the minor-league level, Cronin made some attempts to sign black players. Notably, in 1949, he sent scout Larry Woodall to evaluate an 18-year-old Willie Mays of the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League. But Woodall and Cronin passed on Mays and instead signed Lorenzo &quot;Piper&quot; Davis, 32, who was Mays’ player-manager and a five-time All-star shortstop. Davis became the first black player to sign with the Red Sox organization in 1949, but he was released after one season, which included 15 games played with the 1950 Scranton Red Sox of the Eastern League.

During the 1950s, Cronin&#x27;s farm system signed pitcher Earl Wilson in 1953 and purchased infielder Pumpsie Green in 1955. Wilson rose through the Red Sox&#x27; system until he was called to military service in the U.S. Marines for two years. Finally, in the middle of 1959, both were promoted from the Triple-A Minneapolis Millers by Cronin&#x27;s successor, Bucky Harris: Green became the first African-American to play in a major league game for the Red Sox on July 21; one week later, Wilson became the second, and their first black pitcher. 

===As AL president===

In January 1959, Cronin was elected president of the American League, the first former player to be so elected and the fourth full-time chief executive in the league&#x27;s history. When he replaced the retiring Will Harridge, who became board chairman, Cronin moved the league&#x27;s headquarters from Chicago to Boston. Cronin served as AL president until December 31, 1973, when he was succeeded by Lee MacPhail.

During Cronin&#x27;s 15 years in office, the Junior Circuit expanded from eight to 12 teams, adding the Los Angeles Angels and expansion Washington Senators in and the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots in .

The league also underwent four franchise shifts: the relocation of the original Senators club (now owned by Cronin&#x27;s brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Calvin Griffith and Thelma Griffith Haynes) to Minneapolis–Saint Paul, creating the Minnesota Twins (1961); the shift of the Athletics from Kansas City to Oakland (); the transfer of the Pilots after only one season in Seattle to Milwaukee as the Brewers (); and the transplantation of the expansion Senators after 11 seasons in Washington, D.C., to Dallas–Fort Worth as the Texas Rangers (). The Angels also moved from Los Angeles to adjacent Orange County in and adopted a regional identity, in part because of the dominance of the National League Dodgers, who were the Angels&#x27; landlords at &quot;Chavez Ravine&quot; (Dodger Stadium) from 1962–1965. Of the four expansion teams that joined the league beginning in 1961, three abandoned their original host cities within a dozen years (the Pilots after only one season), and only one team—the Royals—remained in its original municipality. Two of the charter members of the old eight-team league, the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians, also suffered significant attendance woes and were targets of relocation efforts by other cities.

In addition, the AL found itself at a competitive disadvantage compared with the National League during Cronin&#x27;s term. With strong teams in larger markets and a host of new stadiums, the NL outdrew the AL for 33 consecutive years (1956–1988). In 1973, Cronin&#x27;s final season as league president, the NL attracted 55 percent of total MLB attendance, 16.62 million vs. 13.38 million total fans, despite the opening of Royals Stadium in Kansas City and the American League&#x27;s adoption of the designated hitter rule, which was designed to spark scoring and fan interest. While the National League held only an 8–7 edge in World Series play during the Cronin era, it dominated the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, going 15–3–1 in the 19 games played from 1959–1973.

In 1966, while American League president, Cronin hired the first black major league umpire, Emmett Ashford. In an interview with Larry Gerlach, Ashford stated, “Jackie Robinson had his Branch Rickey, I had my Joe Cronin.” 

After the season, Cronin drew headlines when he fired AL umpires Al Salerno and Bill Valentine, ostensibly for poor performance; however, it later surfaced that the two officials were fired for attempting to organize an umpires&#x27; union. Neither man was reinstated (Valentine became a successful minor league front-office executive), but the Major League Umpires Association was formed anyway, two years later.

===Hall of Fame===
Joe Cronin was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame (with Hank Greenberg) in 1956.

==Death==
In the last months of his life, Cronin struggled with cancer that had invaded his prostate and bones; he suffered a great deal of bone pain as a result. Cronin came to Fenway Park for one of his last public appearances when his jersey number 4 was retired by the Red Sox on May 29, 1984. He died at the age of 77 on September 7, 1984, at his home in Osterville, Massachusetts. He is buried in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery in nearby Centerville.

==Legacy==
At the number retirement ceremony shortly before Cronin&#x27;s death, teammate Ted Williams commented on how much he respected Cronin as a father and a man. Cronin was also remembered as a clutch hitter. Manager Connie Mack once commented, &quot;With a man on third and one out, I&#x27;d rather have Cronin hitting for me than anybody I&#x27;ve ever seen, and that includes Cobb, Simmons and the rest of them.&quot;

In 1999, he was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

The Joe Cronin Award was established in 1973 to reward American League players for significant achievement.

<text>Eamon JR Grennan (born 13 November 1941) is an Irish poet born in Dublin, Ireland. He attended University College Dublin where he completed a BA 1963 and an MA 1964. He has lived in the United States, except for brief periods, since 1964. He was the Dexter M. Ferry Jr. Professor of English at Vassar College until his retirement in 2004.

==Biography==
Though his Irish roots are clear in his poetry, Grennan has an international sense of literary tradition. He has cited as influences American poets including Robert Frost and Elizabeth Bishop (herself an international poet with ties to the U.S., Canada, and Brazil). In addition to writing poetry, he has translated Giacomo Leopardi and—with his wife, Vassar classicist Rachel Kitzinger—Sophocles&#x27;s Oedipus at Colonus.

Grennan studied English and Italian at University College, Dublin, where he met poets Derek Mahon and Eavan Boland, and at Harvard University, and began teaching at Vassar in 1974. He returned to Ireland fairly briefly, first in 1977 and later in 1981, and began writing poetry there. His first book, &quot;Wildly for Days&quot;, was published in 1983. Gaelic poetry became an important influence, particularly, he has said, on the sound of his poems. At the same time, he is interested in the sentence as a poetic unit as well as a prose unit. In an interview with Timothy Cahill, Grennan said:
: I have, it&#x27;s a toothache quality, a kind of pain -- the ambition to make a sentence that is full, that has not gone limp, hasn&#x27;t stopped while it still has some elasticity in it.
Grennan&#x27;s career has been long, productive and distinguished, and he has earned from fellow poets a reputation for lyrical skill and psychological intensity. Former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins said of Grennan:
: Few poets are as generous as Eamon Grennan in the sheer volume of delight his poems convey, and fewer still are as attentive to the marvels of the earth. To read him is to be led on a walk through the natural world of clover and cricket and, most of all, light, and to face with an open heart the complexity of being human.

He received the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation in 1998. Grennan was nominated for the 2008 Poetry Now Award for his collection, &quot;Out of Breath&quot;.

<text>&quot;Drosophila&quot; embryogenesis, the process by which &quot;Drosophila&quot; (fruit fly) embryos form, is a favorite model system for genetics and developmental biology. The study of its embryogenesis unlocked the century-long puzzle of how development was controlled, creating the field of evolutionary developmental biology. The small size, short generation time, and large brood size make it ideal for genetic studies. Transparent embryos facilitate developmental studies. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; was introduced into the field of genetic experiments by Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1909.

== Life cycle ==
&quot;Drosophila&quot; display a holometabolous method of development, meaning that they have three distinct stages of their post-embryonic life cycle, each with a radically different body plan: larva, pupa and finally, adult. The machinery necessary for the function and smooth transition between these three phases develops during embryogenesis. During embryogenesis, the larval stage fly will develop and hatch at a stage of its life known as the first larval instar. Cells that will produce adult structures are put aside in imaginal discs. During the pupal stage, the larval body breaks down as the imaginal disks grow and produce the adult body. This process is called &quot;complete metamorphosis&quot;. About 24 hours after fertilization, an egg hatches into a larva, which undergoes three molts taking about 5.5 to 6 days, after which it is called a pupa. The pupa metamorphoses into an adult fly, which takes about 3.5 to 4.5 days. The entire growth process from egg to adult fly takes an estimated 10 to 12 days to complete at 25 °C.

The mother fly produces oocytes that already have anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes defined by maternal activities.

Embryogenesis in &quot;Drosophila&quot; is unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a multinucleate syncytium (strictly a coenocyte). Early on, 256 nuclei migrate to the perimeter of the egg, creating the syncytial blastoderm. The germ line segregates from the somatic cells through the formation of pole cells at the posterior end of the embryo. After thirteen mitotic divisions and about 4 hours after fertilization, an estimated 6,000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the oocyte before they migrate to the surface and are encompassed by plasma membranes to form cells surrounding the yolk sac producing a cellular blastoderm.

Like other triploblastic metazoa, gastrulation leads to the formation of three germ layers: the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The mesoderm invaginates from the ventral furrow (VF), as does the ectoderm that will give rise to the midgut. The pole cells are internalized by a different route.

Germ band elongation involves many rearrangements of cells, and the appearance of distinct differences in the cells of the three germ bands and various regions of the embryo.
The posterior region (including the hindgut) expands and extends towards the anterior pole along the dorsal side of the embryo. At this time, segments of the embryo become visible, creating a striped arrangement along the anterior-posterior axis. The earliest signs of segmentation appear during this phase with the formation of &quot;parasegmental furrows&quot;. This is also when the tracheal pits form, the first signs of structures for breathing.

Germ band retraction returns the hindgut to the dorsal side of the posterior pole and coincides with overt segmentation. The remaining stages involve the internalization of the nervous system (ectoderm) and the formation of internal organs (mainly mesoderm).

== Anterior-posterior axis patterning in &quot;Drosophila&quot; ==

One of the best understood examples of pattern formation is the patterning along the future head to tail (antero-posterior) axis of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. There are three fundamental types of genes that give way to the developmental structure of the fly: maternal effect genes, segmentation genes, and homeotic genes. The development of &quot;Drosophila&quot; is particularly well studied, and it is representative of a major class of animals, the insects or insecta. Other multicellular organisms sometimes use similar mechanisms for axis formation, although the relative importance of signal transfer between the earliest cells of many developing organisms is greater than in the example described here.

=== Maternal effect genes ===

The building-blocks of anterior-posterior axis patterning in &quot;Drosophila&quot; are laid out during egg formation (oogenesis), well before the egg is fertilized and deposited. The maternal effect genes are responsible for the polarity of the egg and of the embryo. The developing egg (oocyte) is polarized by differentially localized mRNA molecules.

The genes that code for these mRNAs, called maternal effect genes, encode for proteins that get translated upon fertilization to establish concentration gradients that span the egg. &quot;Bicoid&quot; and &quot;Hunchback&quot; are the maternal effect genes that are most important for patterning of anterior parts (head and thorax) of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryo. &quot;Nanos&quot; and &quot;Caudal&quot; are maternal effect genes that are important in the formation of more posterior abdominal segments of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryo.

In embryos from &quot;bicoid&quot; mutant mothers, the head and thoracic structures are converted to the abdomen making the embryo with posterior structures on both ends, a lethal phenotype.

Cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules are polarized within the oocyte and can be used to allow the localization of mRNA molecules to specific parts of the cell. Maternally synthesized &quot;bicoid&quot; mRNAs attach to microtubules and are concentrated at the anterior ends of forming &quot;Drosophila&quot; eggs. In unfertilized eggs, transcripts are still strictly localized at the tip, but immediately after fertilization, a small mRNA gradient is formed in the anterior 20% of the eggs. Another report documents a mRNA gradient up to 40%.
&quot;nanos&quot; mRNA also attaches to a &quot;Drosophila&quot; egg&#x27;s cytoskeleton but is concentrated at the posterior end of the egg.
&quot;hunchback&quot; and &quot;caudal&quot; mRNAs lack special location control systems and are fairly evenly spread throughout the entire interior of the egg cells.
It has been shown that the dsRNA-binding protein STAUFEN (STAU1) is responsible for guiding bicoid, nanos and other proteins, which play a role in forming the anterior-posterior axis, to the correct regions of the embryo to build gradients.
When the mRNAs from the maternal effect genes are translated into proteins, a Bicoid protein gradient forms at the anterior end of the egg. Nanos protein forms a gradient at the posterior end. The Bicoid protein blocks translation of &quot;caudal&quot; mRNA so Caudal protein is of lower concentration at the anterior part of the embryo and at higher concentration at the posterior part of the embryo. This is of opposite direction of the Bicoid protein. The caudal protein then activates later to turn genes on to form the posterior structures during the segmentation phase. Nanos protein creates a posterior-to-anterior slope and is a morphogen that helps in abdomen formation. Nanos protein, in complex with Pumilio protein, binds to the &quot;hunchback&quot; mRNA and blocks its translation in the posterior end of &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryos.

The Bicoid, Hunchback, and Caudal proteins are transcription factors. The Bicoid protein is a morphogen as well. The Nanos protein is a translational repressor protein. Bicoid has a DNA-binding homeodomain that binds both DNA and the &quot;nanos&quot; mRNA. Bicoid binds a specific RNA sequence in the 3′ untranslated region, called the Bicoid 3′-UTR regulatory element, of &quot;caudal&quot; mRNA and blocks translation.

Hunchback protein levels in the early embryo are significantly augmented by new &quot;hunchback&quot; gene transcription and translation of the resulting zygotically produced mRNA. During early &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryogenesis, there are nuclear divisions without cell division. The many nuclei that are produced distribute themselves around the periphery of the cell cytoplasm. Gene expression in these nuclei is regulated by the Bicoid, Hunchback, and Caudal proteins. For example, Bicoid acts as a transcriptional activator of &quot;hunchback&quot; gene transcription. In order for development to continue, Hunchback is needed in an area that is declining in amount from anterior to posterior. This is created by the Nanos protein whose existence is at a declining slope from posterior to anterior ends.
=== Gap genes ===

The other important function of the gradients of Bicoid, Hunchback, and Caudal proteins is in the transcriptional regulation of other zygotically expressed proteins. Many of these are the protein products derived from members of the &quot;gap&quot; family of developmental control genes. &quot;giant&quot;, &quot;huckebein&quot;, &quot;hunchback&quot;, &quot;knirps&quot;, &quot;Krüppel&quot; and &quot;tailless&quot; are all gap genes. Their expression patterns in the early embryo are determined by the maternal effect gene products and shown in the diagrams on the right side of this page. The gap genes are part of a larger family called the segmentation genes. These genes establish the segmented body plan of the embryo along the anterior-posterior axis. The segmentation genes specify 14 &quot;parasegments&quot; that are closely related to the final anatomical segments. The gap genes are the first layer of a hierarchical cascade of the segmentation control genes.

=== Additional segmentation genes ===

Two additional classes of segmentation genes are expressed after the gap gene products. The pair-rule genes are expressed in striped patterns of seven bands perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis. These patterns of expression are established within the syncytial blastoderm. After these initial patterning events, cell membranes form around the nuclei of the syncytial blastoderm converting it to a cellular blastoderm.

The expression patterns of the final class of segmentation genes, the segment polarity genes, are then fine-tuned by interactions between the cells of adjacent parasegments with genes such as &quot;engrailed&quot;. The Engrailed protein is a transcription factor that is expressed in one row of cells at the edge of each parasegment. This expression pattern is initiated by the pair-rule genes (like &quot;even-skipped&quot;) that code for transcription factors that regulate the &quot;engrailed&quot; gene&#x27;s transcription in the syncytial blastoderm.

Cells that make Engrailed can make the cell-to-cell signaling protein Hedgehog. The motion of Hedgehog is limited by its lipid modification, and so Hedgehog activates a thin stripe of cells anterior to the Engrailed-expressing cells. Only cells to one side of the Engrailed-expressing cells are competent to respond to Hedgehog because they express the receptor protein Patched. Cells with activated Patched receptor make the Wingless protein. Wingless is a secreted protein that acts on the adjacent rows of cells by activating its cell surface receptor, Frizzled.

Wingless acts on Engrailed-expressing cells to stabilize Engrailed expression after the cellular blastoderm forms. The Naked cuticle protein is induced by Wingless to limit the number of rows of cells that express Engrailed. The short-range, reciprocal signaling by Hedgehog and Wingless, held in check by the Patched and Naked proteins, stabilizes the boundary between each segment. The Wingless protein is called &quot;wingless&quot; because of the phenotype of some &quot;wingless&quot; mutants. Wingless and Hedgehog also function in multiple tissues later in embryogenesis and also during metamorphosis.

The transcription factors that are coded for by segmentation genes regulate yet another family of developmental control genes, the homeotic selector genes. These genes exist in two ordered groups on &quot;Drosophila&quot; chromosome 3. The order of the genes on the chromosome reflects the order that they are expressed along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing embryo. The Antennapedia group of homeotic selector genes includes &quot;labial&quot;, &quot;antennapedia&quot;, &quot;sex combs reduced&quot;, &quot;deformed&quot;, and &quot;proboscipedia&quot;. Labial and Deformed proteins are expressed in head segments where they activate the genes that define head features. Sex-combs-reduced and Antennapedia specify the properties of thoracic segments. The bithorax group of homeotic selector genes control the specializations of the third thoracic segment and the abdominal segments. Mutations in some homeotic genes can often be lethal and the cycle of life will end at embryogenesis.

In 1995, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded for studies concerning the genetic control of early embryonic development to Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, Edward B. Lewis and Eric Wieschaus. Their research on genetic screening for embryo patterning mutants revealed the role played in early embryologic development by &quot;homeobox genes&quot; like &quot;bicoid&quot;. An example of a homeotic mutation is the so-called Antennapedia mutation. In &quot;Drosophila&quot;, antennae and legs are created by the same basic &quot;program&quot;, they only differ in a single transcription factor. If this transcription factor is damaged, the fly grows legs on its head instead of antennae. See images of this &quot;antennapedia&quot; mutant and others, at FlyBase. Another example is in the bithorax complex. If nonlethal mutations occur in this complex, it can cause the fly to have two sets of wings, instead of one pair of wings and one pair of halteres, which aid in balance in flight.

== Dorsal-ventral axis ==
Formation of the dorsal-ventral axis is dependent on the ventral nuclear concentration of a maternally synthesized transcription factor called Dorsal. The determination of the dorsal side of the embryo occurs during oogenesis when the oocyte nucleus moves along microtubules from the posterior to the anterior-dorsal margin of the oocyte. The nucleus expresses a protein called Gurken which is secreted locally and thus only activates follicle cells in the dorsal region by interacting with the Torpedo receptor. This inhibits the production of Pipe protein and thus follicular cells expressing Pipe are on the ventral side. Pipe activates an extracellular protease cascade in the perivitelline space between the follicle cells and the egg which results in the cleavage of the Toll-ligand Spätzle and activation of the Toll signaling cascade on the ventral side. Dorsal protein is present throughout embryonic cytoplasm but bound to Cactus which prevents it from translocating to the nucleus. Toll signaling results in the degradation of Cactus which allows Dorsal to enter the nuclei on the ventral side of the blastoderm. Overall, a difference in the localization of the oocyte nucleus becomes a difference in the signaling state of the surrounding follicle cells which then signal to the resulting blastoderm nuclei.

Once in the nucleus, Dorsal activates different genes depending upon its nuclear concentration. This process sets up a gradient between the ventral and dorsal side of the blastoderm embryo with the repression or induction of Dorsal target genes being differentially regulated.
At the ventral end of the embryo, blastoderm nuclei exposed to high concentrations of dorsal protein induce the transcription of the transcription factors &quot;twist&quot; and &quot;snail&quot; while repressing &quot;zerknüllt&quot; and &quot;decapentaplegic&quot;. This results in the formation of the mesoderm.
In the lateral regions of the embryo, low nuclear concentrations of Dorsal lead to the expression of &quot;rhomboid&quot; which identifies future neuroectoderm. More dorsally, active Dpp signaling represses &quot;rhomboid&quot; thus confining it to the lateral blastoderm nuclei.
At the dorsal side of the embryo, blastoderm nuclei where this is little or no nuclear dorsal protein express &quot;zerknüllt&quot;, &quot;tolloid&quot;, and &quot;decapentaplegic&quot; (Dpp). This leads to the specification of non-neural ectoderm and later in the blastula stage to anmioserosa. 
The ventral activity of the TGF-β family signaling protein Dpp is maintained by the expression of the secreted Dpp-antagonist Sog (short gastrulation) in the neuroectoderm. Sog binds to and prevents Dpp from diffusing to the ventral side of the embryo and through the cleavage of Sog by Tolloid also enables a sharpening of the Dpp gradient on the dorsal side. The DV axis of &quot;Drosophila&quot; is due to the interaction of two gradients – a ventral concentration of nuclear Dorsal and a dorsal concentration of Dpp activity.

<text>Telstra Tower (also known as Black Mountain Tower and formerly Telecom Tower) is a telecommunications tower and lookout that is situated above the summit of Black Mountain in Australia&#x27;s capital city of Canberra. It is named after Australia&#x27;s largest telecommunications company, Telstra Corporation. Rising above the mountain summit, it is a landmark in Canberra and offers panoramic views of the city and its surrounding countryside from an indoor observation deck and two outdoor viewing platforms.

It was closed to the public in 2021, but in 2023, the ABC reported the tower was set to reopen in 2025 with a makeover celebrating Ngunnawal culture. the ACT Chief Minister, Andrew Barr expects the tower to reopen in 2026.

==History==
In April 1971, the Postmaster General (PMG) at the time commissioned the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction to carry out a feasibility study in relation to a tower on Black Mountain accommodating both communication services and facilities for visitors. The tower was to replace the microwave relay station on Red Hill and the television broadcast masts already on Black Mountain.

Design of the tower was the responsibility of the Department of Housing and Construction, however a conflict arose with the National Capital Development Commission which, at the time, had complete control over planning within the Australian Capital Territory.

During the approval process of the tower, protests arose on aesthetic and ecological grounds. Some people felt that the tower would dominate other aesthetic Canberra structures due to its location above Black Mountain and within a nature reserve. There was a brief green ban imposed by the Builders Labourers Federation (under the influence of Jack Mundey) that eventually failed. A case was brought before the High Court of Australia arguing that the Federal Government did not have the constitutional power to construct the tower. The decision was made in favour of the government and construction was able to commence.

Black Mountain Tower was opened on 15 May 1980 by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. It was officially named Telecom Tower, and when the telecommunications company was rebranded in 1993, became Telstra Tower.

Prior to the construction of the tower, CTC-TV (now known as Southern Cross 10) had its studios located at the top of Black Mountain until new studios were constructed in Watson in 1974. Also located on the top were two guy-wired masts, one for CTC-TV channel 7 and the other one for the local ABC TV station broadcasting on channel 3. These were demolished in 1980 after the tower had opened.

The Alto Tower Restaurant, a revolving restaurant in the tower, closed on 14 February 2013.

==Facilities==

Telstra Tower provides important communication facilities for Canberra. There are three floors of business, sales and radio communication facilities located between the 30.5 metre and 42.7 metre levels providing space for communication dishes, platforms and equipment for mobile services within the tower.

The tower&#x27;s currently closed public viewing platforms have provided 360 degree views of Canberra and the surrounding city and countryside. Prior to its closure to the public in mid-2021, visitors to Telstra Tower could see the city unfold from the enclosed viewing gallery or from the two open viewing platforms.

Former facilities included Canberra&#x27;s only revolving restaurant which closed in 2013, and completed a full rotation every 81 minutes, allowing diners to experience a changing view throughout their meal. In the lower level of the Tower&#x27;s entrance foyer, there was an exhibition, &quot;Making Connections&quot;, which traced the history of Australian telecommunications from the earliest days into the 21st century. A theatre showed a video, produced shortly after the tower opened, on the tower&#x27;s design and construction.

Telstra Tower has become one of the most symbolic landmarks in Canberra and a major tourist attraction, with an estimated 430,000 visitors each year by 2017. In 1989 the World Federation of Great Towers invited the tower to join such distinguished monuments as the CN Tower in Toronto, Blackpool Tower in England and the Empire State Building in New York City.

Telstra Tower is one of the most visually imposing structures on the Canberra skyline, visible from many parts of Canberra and Queanbeyan.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, and the restrictions on public gatherings within the ACT, the Tower was closed in July 2021. Since then InfraCo has been working on developing a long-term strategy for the usage of the Tower.

<text>Shawn Moltke (born September 6, 1965), better known by his stage name MC Shan, is an American rapper, singer and record producer from New York City. He is best known for his guest appearance and production on Canadian singer Snow&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Informer&quot;, which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Shan is also known for his 1986 single &quot;The Bridge,&quot; which was produced by Marley Marl and entered the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

==Career==
In 1985, Shan signed with MCA Records to release his debut single, &quot;Feed the World&quot;, which became his only song with the label. He was also interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary &quot;Big Fun In The Big Town&quot;. MCA were not sure about what to do with hip hop, thus he was dismissed from the label. Not long after, Shan signed with Cold Chillin&#x27; Records due to his relationship with Marl, and joined Marl&#x27;s Juice Crew. His debut album &quot;Down by Law&quot; was released by Warner Bros. in 1987. MC Shan was one of the first hip hop artists to have a major record deal with the label.

He also found himself to be a key player in the noted hip-hop rivalry known as the Bridge Wars, between the Juice Crew and Boogie Down Productions. Controversy rose from his 1986 single &quot;The Bridge&quot;. The A-side, one of the first song to sample &quot;Impeach The President&quot; (before was &quot;Get Physical&quot; for Steady B, also produced by Marley Marl) tells the story of how his crew got started in Queensbridge Houses, the public housing projects just north of the Queensboro Bridge. It also provided a template for other artists to use it as Queens representative anthem. The B-side is a mild-tempered diss-track aimed at LL Cool J for his song Rock The Bells which took the beat from &quot;Marley Scratch&quot;, a promo by Marlon and Shawn from 1985 on NIA Records. Although at the time this practice was not allowed, KRS-One however responded with a parody of &quot;The Bridge&quot; named &quot;South Bronx,&quot; and the Juice Crew sampled that song with a reply, &quot;Kill That Noise.&quot; &quot;Slate&quot; magazine described the conflict: &quot;In 1986, it was a beef that launched the star of KRS-One.&quot; A week later, Boogie Down Productions then released &quot;The Bridge is Over,&quot; widely celebrated among hip-hop fans as the highest rated diss track. Somehow all the negative attention went to MC Shan. Years later, MC Shan remade &quot;The Bridge&quot; into &quot;Da Bridge 2001&quot;, and strongly denied the bridge &quot;was over&quot;, saying:

:&quot;The Bridge was never over&quot;
:&quot;We left our mark&quot;
:&quot;This jam is dedicated to you and your boys&quot;
:&quot;I brought my Queensbridge thugs to kill that noise&quot;

Shan&#x27;s second album, &quot;Born To Be Wild&quot;, followed in 1988 and revealed Shan&#x27;s b-boy persona, with production once again by Marley Marl. 1990&#x27;s &quot;Play it Again, Shan&quot; displayed a more mature style but it also proved to be his last album. When Cold Chillin&#x27;s sub-label Livin&#x27; Large was active, Shan was listed as one of its artists but only released two singles (&quot;Hip Hop Roughneck&quot; b/w &quot;Watchin&#x27; My Style&quot; and &quot;Pee-Nile Reunion&quot; (prod. Large Professor, feat. Kool G Rap, Neek The Exotic, Snow, and Diesel) b/w &quot;Don&#x27;t Call It A Comeback&quot;). Despite the fact that he focused more on his production career (like Snow&#x27;s &quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot;, which featured &quot;Informer&quot;, on which he appeared) he recorded &quot;Da Bridge 2001&quot; for Nas&#x27; 2000 compilation called &quot;QB&#x27;s Finest&quot;, which also featured Mobb Deep, Cormega, and Nature.

Shan had a brief stint in films, playing a bit role in Steve Martin&#x27;s &quot;L.A. Story&quot; as Rappin&#x27; Waiter. Shan is credited as the guest rapper on the Sum 41 song &quot;Dave&#x27;s Possessed Hair/It&#x27;s What We&#x27;re All About&quot; in the album &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot;.

In June 2017, MC Shan released his first new studio album in 27 years titled &quot;Bars Over Bullshit&quot;, which was released digitally through iTunes and Google Play.

<text>The Punjabis (Punjabi: ; ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ; romanised as Pañjābī) are an Indo-Aryan ethnolinguistic group associated with the Punjab region, comprising areas of northwestern India and eastern Pakistan. They generally speak Standard Punjabi or various Punjabi dialects on both sides.

Majority of the overall Punjabi population adheres to Islam with significant minorities practicing Sikhism and Hinduism and smaller minorities practicing Christianity. However, the religious demographics significantly vary when viewed from Pakistani and Indian sides, respectively, with over 95 percent of the Punjabi population from Pakistan being Muslim, with a small minority of Christians and Hindus and an even smaller minority of Sikhs. Over 57 percent of the population of the Indian state of Punjab is Sikh and over 38 percent Hindu with a small minority of Muslims and Christians.

The ethnonym is derived from the term &quot;Punjab&quot; (Five rivers) in Persian to describe the geographic region of the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, where five rivers Beas, Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej merge into the Indus River, in addition of the now-vanished Ghaggar.

The coalescence of the various tribes, castes and the inhabitants of the Punjab region into a broader common &quot;Punjabi&quot; identity initiated from the onset of the 18th century CE. Historically, the Punjabi people were a heterogeneous group and were subdivided into a number of clans called &quot;biradari&quot; (literally meaning &quot;brotherhood&quot;) or &quot;tribes&quot;, with each person bound to a clan. With the passage of time, tribal structures became replaced with a more cohesive and holistic society, as community building and group cohesiveness form the new pillars of Punjabi society.

Traditionally, the Punjabi identity is primarily linguistic, geographical and cultural. Its identity is independent of historical origin or religion and refers to those who reside in the Punjab region or associate with its population and those who consider the Punjabi language their mother tongue. Integration and assimilation are important parts of Punjabi culture, since Punjabi identity is not based solely on tribal connections. While Punjabis share a common territory, ethnicity and language, they are likely to be followers of one of several religions, most often Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism or Christianity.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Punjab&quot; came into currency during the reign of Akbar in the late sixteenth century. Though the name Punjab is of Persian origin, its two parts ( and ) are cognates of the Sanskrit words, and , of the same meaning. The word &quot;pañjāb&quot; thus means &#x27;The Land of Five Waters&#x27;, referring to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas. All are tributaries of the Indus River, the Sutlej being the largest. References to a land of five rivers may be found in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which calls one of the regions in ancient Bharat &quot;Panchanada&quot; (). The ancient Greeks referred to the region as &quot;Pentapotamía&quot; (), which has the same meaning as the Persian word.

==Geographic distribution==

Punjab is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in South Asia, specifically in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts. The geographical definition of the term &quot;Punjab&quot; has changed over time. In the 16th century Mughal Empire it referred to a relatively smaller area between the Indus and the Sutlej rivers. 
=== Pakistan ===
While the total population of Punjab is 110 million as noted in the 2017 Pakistan census, ethnic Punjabis comprise approximately 44.7% of the national population. With an estimated national population of 252 million in 2024, ethnic Punjabis thus number approximately 112.8 million in Pakistan; this makes Punjabis the largest ethnic group in Pakistan by population.

Religious homogeneity remains elusive as a predominant Sunni population with Shia, Ahmadiyya and Christian minorities.

=== India ===
The Punjabi-speaking people make up 2.74% of India&#x27;s population as of 2011. The total number of Indian Punjabis is unknown due to the fact that ethnicity is not recorded in the Census of India. Sikhs are largely concentrated in the modern-day state of Punjab forming 57.7% of the population with Hindus forming 38.5%. Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi&#x27;s total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus. The Indian censuses record the native languages, but not the descent of the citizens. Thus, there is no concrete official data on the ethnic makeup of Delhi and other Indian states.

Indian Punjab is also home to small groups of Muslims and Christians. Most of the East Punjab&#x27;s Muslims left for West Punjab in 1947. However, a small community still exists today, mainly in Qadian, and Malerkotla.

===Punjabi diaspora===
The Punjabi people have emigrated in large numbers to many parts of the world. In the early 20th century, many Punjabis began settling in the United States, including independence activists who formed the Ghadar Party. The United Kingdom has a significant number of Punjabis from both Pakistan and India. The most populous areas being London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. In Canada (specifically Vancouver, Toronto, and Calgary) and the United States, (specifically California&#x27;s Central Valley as well as the New York and New Jersey region). In the 1970s, a large wave of emigration of Punjabis (predominately from Pakistan) began to the Middle East, in places such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. There are also large communities in East Africa including the countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Punjabis have also emigrated to Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia including Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong. Of recent times many Punjabis have also moved to Italy.


== Demography ==
=== Castes and tribes ===
Among the major castes and tribes of West Punjab (Pakistan) are the Jats, Rajputs, Arains, Gujjars and Awans. Prior to the partition in 1947, major communities of West Punjab also included the Khatris, Aroras and Brahmins.

While in East Punjab (India), Jats are almost 20 per cent of East Punjab&#x27;s population. The Scheduled Castes constitute almost 32 per cent of its total population and 4.3 per cent of the SCs nationally, official data show. Of more than 35 designated Scheduled Castes in the state, the Mazhabis, the Ravidasias/Ramdasias, the Ad Dharmis, the Valmikis, and the Bazigars together make up around 87 per cent of East Punjab&#x27;s total Scheduled Caste population. The Ravidasia Hindus/Ad-Dharmi and the Ramdasia Sikhs together constitute 34.93 per cent of East Punjab&#x27;s total Scheduled Caste population and 11.15 per cent of Punjab Population. Ramdasia, Ad-Dharmi and Ravidassias are subgroups of the Chamar and are traditionally linked to leather-related occupations.

=== Religions in Punjab ===
Proto-Hinduism is the oldest of the religions practised by the Punjabi people. The historical Vedic religion constituted the religious ideas and practices in the Punjab during the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), centered primarily in the worship of Indra. The bulk of the Rigveda was composed in the Punjab region between circa 1500 and 1200 BC, while later Vedic scriptures were composed more eastwards, between the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. An ancient Indian law book called the Manusmriti, developed by Brahmin Hindu priests, shaped Punjabi religious life from 200 BC onward.

Later, the spread of Buddhisim and Jainism in the Indian subcontinent saw the growth of Buddhism and Jainism in the Punjab. Islam was introduced via southern Punjab in the 8th century, becoming the majority by the 16th century, via local conversion. There was a small Jain community left in Punjab by the 16th century, while the Buddhist community had largely disappeared by the turn of the 10th century. The region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the Punjab region. 

The rise of Sikhism in the 1700s saw some Punjabis, both Hindu and Muslim, accepting the new Sikh faith. A number of Punjabis during the colonial period of India became Christians, with all of these religions characterising the religious diversity now found in the Punjab region.

=== Modern era ===
Due to religious tensions, emigration between Punjabi people started far before the partition and dependable records. Shortly prior to the Partition of India, Punjab Province (British India) had a slight majority Muslim population at about 53.2% in 1941, which was an increase from the previous years. 

Due to the partition of 1947, a rapid shift towards religious homogeneity occurred in all districts across the Punjab region owing to the new international border that cut through the province. This rapid demographic shift was primarily due to mass migration and population exchange but also caused by large-scale religious cleansing riots that occurred across the region at the time. According to historical demographer Tim Dyson, in the eastern regions of Punjab that ultimately became Indian Punjab following independence, districts that were 66% Hindu in 1941 became 80% Hindu in 1951; those that were 20% Sikh became 50% Sikh in 1951. Conversely, in the western regions of Punjab that ultimately became Pakistani Punjab, all districts became almost exclusively Muslim by 1951.

As a result of the population exchanges during partition, both parts of Punjab are now relatively homogeneous, as far as religion is concerned. Today the majority of Pakistani Punjabis follow Islam with a small Christian minority, and less Sikh and Hindu populations, while the majority of Indian Punjabis are either Sikhs or Hindus with a Muslim minority. Punjab is also the birthplace of Sikhism and the movement Ahmadiyya.

====Punjabi Muslims====

Punjabi Muslims are found almost exclusively in Pakistan with 97% of Punjabis who live in Pakistan following Islam, in contrast to Punjabi Sikhs and Punjabi Hindus who predominantly live in India.

Forming the majority of the Punjabi ethnicity in the greater Punjab region, Punjabi Muslims write the Punjabi language under the Perso-Arabic script known as Shahmukhi. With a population of more than 80 million, they are the largest ethnic group in Pakistan and the world&#x27;s third-largest Islam-adhering ethnicity after Arabs and Bengalis. The majority of Punjabi Muslims are adherents of Sunni Islam, while a minority adhere to Shia Islam and other sects, including the Ahmadiyya community which originated in Punjab during the British Raj.

====Punjabi Hindus====

In the Indian state of Punjab, Punjabi Hindus make up approximately 38.5% of the state&#x27;s population; numbering 10.7 million and are a majority in the Doaba region. Punjabi Hindus form a majority in five districts of Punjab, namely, Pathankot, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Fazilka and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts.

Punjabi Hindus also form around 8-10 percent of Indian state Haryana&#x27;s population and are very much influential in the state politics. 

During the 1947 partition, millions of Punjabi Hindus (including Hindkowan Hindus and Saraiki Hindus) migrated from West Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, of which many ultimately settled in Delhi. Determined from 1991 and 2015 estimates, Punjabi Hindus form approximately 24 to 35 per cent of Delhi&#x27;s population; based on 2011 official census counts, this amounts to between 4,029,106 and 5,875,779 people.

Following the large scale exodus that took place during the 1947 partition, there remains a small Punjabi Hindu community in Pakistan today. According to the 2017 Census, there are about 200,000 Hindus in Punjab province, forming approximately 0.2% of the total population. Much of the community resides in the primarily rural South Punjab districts of Rahim Yar Khan and Bahawalpur where they form 3.12% and 1.12% of the population respectively, while the rest are concentrated in urban centres such as Lahore. Punjabi Hindus in India use Nāgarī script to write the Hindi and Punjabi languages.

====Punjabi Sikhs====
Sikhism from &quot;Sikh&quot;, meaning a &quot;disciple&quot;, or a &quot;learner&quot;, is a monotheistic religion originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent during the 15th century. The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, unity and equality of all humankind, engaging in selfless service, striving for social justice for the benefit and prosperity of all, and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder&#x27;s life. Being one of the youngest amongst the major world religions, with 25-28 million adherents worldwide, Sikhism is the fifth- largest religion in the world.

The Sikhs form a majority of close to 58% in the modern day Punjab, India.

Gurmukhi is the writing script used by Sikhs and for scriptures of Sikhism. It is used in official documents in parts of India and elsewhere. The tenth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh (1666 – 1708) established the Khalsa Brotherhood, and set for them a code of conduct.

====Punjabi Christians====

Most of the modern Punjabi Christians are descended from converts during British rule; initially, conversions to Christianity came from the &quot;upper levels of Punjab society, from the privileged and prestigious&quot;, including &quot;high caste&quot; Hindu families, as well as Muslim families. However, other modern Punjabi Christians have converted from the Chuhra group. The Churas were largely converted to Christianity in North India during the British Raj. The vast majority were converted from the Hindu Chura communities of Punjab, and to a lesser extent Mazhabi Sikhs; under the influence of enthusiastic army officers and Christian missionaries. Large numbers of Mazhabi Sikhs were also converted in the Moradabad district and the Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh. Rohilkhand saw a mass conversion of its entire population of 4500 Mazhabi Sikhs into the Methodist Church. Sikh organisations became alarmed at the rate of conversions among high caste Sikh families, and as a result, they responded by immediately dispatching Sikh missionaries to counteract the conversions.

==History==

== Culture ==
Punjabi culture grew out of the settlements along the five rivers, which served as an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilisation, dating back to 3000 BCE. Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one&#x27;s social status being determined by landownership. The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, has been described as the &quot;breadbasket of both India and Pakistan&quot;. Besides being known for agriculture and trade, the Punjab is also a region that over the centuries has experienced many foreign invasions and consequently has a long-standing history of warfare, as the Punjab is situated on the principal route of invasions through the northwestern frontier of the Indian subcontinent, which promoted to adopt a lifestyle that entailed engaging in warfare to protect the land. Warrior culture typically elevates the value of the community&#x27;s honour (izzat), which is highly esteemed by Punjabis.

===Language===
Punjabi, sometimes spelled Panjabi, is an Indo-Aryan language natively spoken by the Punjabi people.

Punjabi is the most popular first language in Pakistan, with 80.5 million native speakers as per the 2017 census, and the 11th most popular in India, with 31.1 million native speakers, as per the 2011 census.

The language is spoken among a significant overseas diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

In Pakistan, Punjabi is written using the Shahmukhi alphabet, based on the Perso-Arabic script; in India, it is written using the Gurmukhi alphabet, based on the Indic scripts. Punjabi is unusual among the Indo-Aryan languages and the broader Indo-European language family in its usage of lexical tone.

Punjabi developed from Prakrit languages and later (, &#x27;deviated&#x27; or &#x27;non-grammatical speech&#x27;) From 600 BCE, Sanskrit was advocated as official language and Prakrit gave birth to many regional languages in different parts of India. All these languages are called Prakrit (Sanskrit: ) collectively. Paishachi, Shauraseni and Gandhari were Prakrit languages, which were spoken in north and north-western India and Punjabi developed from one of these Prakrits. Later in northern India, these Prakrits gave rise to their own
Apabhraṃśa, a descendant of Prakrit. Punjabi emerged as an Apabhraṃśa, a degenerated form of Prakrit, in the 7th century CE and became stable by the 10th century. The earliest writings in Punjabi belong to Nath Yogi era from 9th to 14th century CE. The language of these compositions is morphologically closer to Shauraseni Apbhramsa, though vocabulary and rhythm is surcharged with extreme colloquialism and folklore. The Arabic and modern Persian influence in the historical Punjab region began with the late first millennium Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent. Many Persian and Arabic words were incorporated in Punjabi. So Punjabi relies heavily on Persian and Arabic words which are used with a liberal approach to language. After the fall of the Sikh empire, Urdu was made the official language of Punjab (in Pakistani Punjab, it is still the primary official language), and influenced the language as well.

Punjabis also speak several languages and dialects related to Punjabi, such as the Pothwari spoken in the Pothohar region of Northern Pakistani Punjab

===Traditional dress===
 Kaintha

The Kaintha, a traditional necklace which is usually made out of gold or steel, is an integral element of Punjabi clothing. It is adorned with a pendant that stands out from the rest of the necklace, which is accompanied by matching color schemes as well as yarn in the back to hold the piece together. It is worn with the Shalwar Kameez alongside a shawl, chunni, or vest. Men and women alike traditionally wear the Kaintha to the Mayian and Jaggo ceremonies. It is also commonly worn while performing the traditional Bhangra and Giddha dances

Phulkari

A traditional element of Punjabi clothing has been the Phulkari. The phulkari is folk embroidery that was typically inclusive of work in floral patterns but has taken on a larger aspect of including geometrical shapes, symbols and motifs relevant to the culture. This pattern has been worn by women for hundreds of years in very vibrant colours. The pattern is typically stitched with woven silk and colourful thread. The phulkari pattern is adorned onto dupattas/chunis, better known as a decorative scarf. Over time the phulkari pattern has taken onto embellishments onto suits, dresses, accessories and more. You will see women wearing phulkari during important religious and cultural folk celebrations (i.e.: Vaisakhi, Lohri) and then in wedding celebrations such as the Jago.

;Dastar
A Dastar is an item of headgear associated with Sikhism and is an important part of the Punjabi and Sikh culture. Among the Sikhs, the &quot;dastār&quot; is an article of faith that represents equality, honour, self-respect, courage, spirituality, and piety. The Khalsa Sikh men and women, who keep the Five Ks, wear the turban to cover their long, uncut hair (&quot;kesh&quot;). The Sikhs regard the &quot;dastār&quot; as an important part of the unique Sikh identity. After the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, was sentenced to death by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru created the Khalsa and gave five articles of faith, one of which is unshorn hair, which the &quot;dastār&quot; covers. Prior to Sikhi, only kings, royalty, and those of high stature wore turbans, but Sikh Gurus adopted the practice to assert equality and sovereignty among people.
;Punjabi suit

A Punjabi suit that features two items - a &quot;qameez&quot; (top), &quot;salwar&quot; (bottom) is the traditional attire of the Punjabi people. &quot;Shalwars&quot; are trousers which are atypically wide at the waist but which narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring or elastic belt, which causes them to become pleated around the waist. The trousers can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias. The &quot;kameez&quot; is a long shirt or tunic. The side seams are left open below the waist-line (the opening known as the &quot;chaak&quot;), which gives the wearer greater freedom of movement. The kameez is usually cut straight and flat; older kameez use traditional cuts; modern kameez are more likely to have European-inspired set-in sleeves. The combination garment is sometimes called &quot;salwar kurta&quot;, &quot;salwar suit&quot;, or &quot;Punjabi suit&quot;. The shalwar-kameez is a widely-worn, and national dress, of Pakistan. When women wear the shalwar-kameez in some regions, they usually wear a long scarf or shawl called a dupatta around the head or neck. The dupatta is also employed as a form of modesty—although it is made of delicate material, it obscures the upper body&#x27;s contours by passing over the shoulders. For Muslim women, the dupatta is a less stringent alternative to the chador or burqa (see hijab and purdah); for Sikh and Hindu women, the dupatta is useful when the head must be covered, as in a temple or the presence of elders. Everywhere in South Asia, modern versions of the attire have evolved; the shalwars are worn lower down on the waist, the kameez have shorter length, with higher splits, lower necklines and backlines, and with cropped sleeves or without sleeves.

===Music===

Bhangra describes dance-oriented popular music with Punjabi rhythms, developed since the 1980s. Sufi music and Qawali, commonly practised in Punjab, Pakistan; are other important genres in the Punjab region.

===Dance===

Punjabi dances are performed either by men or by women. The dances range from solo to group dances and also sometimes dances are done along with traditional musical instruments. Bhangra is one of the most famous dances originating in the Punjab by farmers during the harvesting season. It was mainly performed while farmers did agricultural chores. As they did each farming activity they would perform bhangra moves on the spot. This allowed them to finish their job in a pleasurable way. For many years, farmers performed bhangra to showcase a sense of accomplishment and to welcome the new harvesting season. Traditional bhangra is performed in a circle and is performed using traditional dance steps. Traditional bhangra is now also performed on occasions other than during the harvest season.

===Folk tales===

The folk tales of Punjab include Heer Ranjha, Mirza Sahiban, Sohni Mahiwal.

===Festivals===
The Punjabi Muslims typically observe the Islamic festivals. The Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus typically do not observe these, and instead observe Lohri, Basant and Vaisakhi as seasonal festivals. The Punjabi Muslim festivals are set according to the lunar Islamic calendar (Hijri), and the date falls earlier by 10 to 13 days from year to year. The Hindu and Sikh Punjabi seasonal festivals are set on specific dates of the luni-solar Bikrami calendar or Punjabi calendar and the date of the festival also typically varies in the Gregorian calendar but stays within the same two Gregorian months.

Some Punjabi Muslims participate in the traditional, seasonal festivals of the Punjab region: Baisakhi, Basant and to a minor scale Lohri, but this is controversial. Islamic clerics and some politicians have attempted to ban this participation because of the religious basis of the Punjabi festivals, and they being declared haram (forbidden in Islam).

=== Punjabi State ===

According to Pippa Virdee, the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan has shadowed the sense of loss of what used to be a homeland nation for the Punjabi people in the Indian subcontinent and its diaspora. Since the mid-1980s, there has been a drive for Punjabi cultural revival, consolidation of Punjabi ethnicity and a virtual Punjabi nation. According to Giorgio Shani, this is predominantly a Sikh ethno-nationalism movement led by some Sikh organisations, and a view that is not shared by Punjabi people organisations belonging to other religions.

<doc id="583052" wikidata="Q337127" url="?curid=583052" title="Garry Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford">
<text>Walter Garrison Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford (10 November 1934 – 10 December 2020), usually known informally as Garry Runciman, was a British historical sociologist and hereditary peer. A senior research fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, Runciman wrote several publications in his field. He also sat on the Securities and Investments Board and chaired the British Government&#x27;s Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (1991–1993).

== Background ==
Runciman was the son of Leslie Runciman, 2nd Viscount Runciman of Doxford, by his second wife, Katherine Schuyler Garrison. The British historian Sir Steven Runciman was his uncle.

Runciman was educated at Eton College, where he was an Oppidan Scholar, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He inherited the viscountcy on the death of his father in 1989.

== Career ==
Runciman joined the faculty of Trinity College, Cambridge, in the 1950s as a historical sociologist and became a junior research fellow after submitting a thesis entitled &quot;Plato&#x27;s Later Epistemology&quot;. In the 1960s he became primarily a sociologist. He became a senior research fellow in 1971, researching in the field of comparative and historical sociology. Runciman&#x27;s principal research interest was the application of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory to cultural and social selection.

He held honorary degrees from King&#x27;s College London and the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford, and York. He was also an Honorary Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an Honorary Bencher of Inner Temple. He was elected to the British Academy in 1975 and served as its president from 2001 to 2005. Runciman was also an honorary fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford.

== Official and parliamentary work ==
Runciman was invited by the Governor of the Bank of England to serve on the Securities and Investment Board (later to become the Financial Services Authority), from which he retired in 1998.

Runciman chaired the British Government&#x27;s Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, established in 1991 and which continued Sir John May&#x27;s inquiry into the convictions of the Maguire Seven and encompassed further miscarriages of justice. It reported to parliament in 1993. As a result, the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 established the Criminal Cases Review Commission as an executive Non-Departmental Public Body.

Runciman was a member of the House of Lords as a hereditary peer from the time he inherited the viscountcy on 1 September 1989. He spoke 26 times in the chamber until 11 November 1999 when he lost his right to sit there when the bulk of the hereditary peers were removed by the House of Lords Act 1999. Runciman sat for a subsequent by-election to the Lords in 2010 to fill the Crossbench hereditary seat vacancy following the death of Lord Colville of Culross; the House seat went to the Earl of Clancarty.

== Publications ==
Runciman&#x27;s first major publication was &quot;Relative Deprivation and Social Justice: a Study of Attitudes to Social Inequality in Twentieth-Century Britain&quot;. Since then, he has published &quot;A Critique of Max Weber&#x27;s Philosophy of Social Science&quot;, &quot;A Treatise on Social Theory&quot;, and &quot;The Social Animal&quot;. In 2004, he edited and contributed to a British Academy occasional paper &quot;Hutton and Butler: Lifting the Lid on the Workings of Power&quot;, which deals with the events surrounding Britain&#x27;s participation in the invasion of Iraq and the way in which it was presented to the British public.

==Marriage and children==
Runciman married Ruth Hellman on 17 April 1963. She was made a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1998. They had three children:

* Hon. Lisa Runciman (born 18 August 1965)
* David Walter Runciman, 4th Viscount Runciman of Doxford (born 1 March 1967)
* Hon. Catherine Runciman (born 18 July 1969)

Runciman died on 10 December 2020. His heir, the 4th Viscount, is a political scientist and writer who teaches at Cambridge University as a Professor of Politics.

<doc id="583054" wikidata="Q5283452" url="?curid=583054" title="District of Maine">
<text>The District of Maine was the governmental designation for what is now the U.S. state of Maine from October 25, 1780 to March 15, 1820, when it was admitted to the Union as the 23rd state. The district was a part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and before American independence had been part of the British province of Massachusetts Bay.

==Colonial history==

Originally settled in 1607 by the Plymouth Company, the coastal area between the Merrimack and Kennebec rivers, as well as an irregular parcel of land between the headwaters of the two rivers, became the province of Maine in a 1622 land grant. In 1629, the land was split, creating an area between the Piscataqua and Merrimack rivers which became the province of New Hampshire. It existed through a series of land patents made by the kings of England during this era, and included New Somersetshire, Lygonia, and Falmouth. The province was incorporated into the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the 1650s, beginning with the formation of York County, Massachusetts, which extended from the Piscataqua River to just east of the mouth of the Presumpscot River in Casco Bay. Eventually, its territory grew to encompass nearly all of present-day Maine. The large size of the county led to its division in 1760 through the creation of Cumberland and Lincoln counties.

The northeastern portion of present-day Maine was first sparsely occupied by Maliseet Indians and French settlers from Acadia. The lands between the Kennebec and Saint Croix rivers were granted to the Duke of York in 1664, who had them administered as Cornwall County, part of his proprietary Province of New York. In 1688, these lands (along with the rest of New York) were subsumed into the Dominion of New England. English and French claims in western Maine would be contested, at times violently, until the British conquest of New France in the French and Indian War. With the creation of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692, the entirety of what is now Maine became part of that province.

==District history==
When Massachusetts adopted its state constitution in 1780, it created the District of Maine to manage its northernmost counties, bounded on the west by the Piscataqua River and on the east by the Saint Croix River. By 1820, the District had been further subdivided with the creation of Hancock, Kennebec, Oxford, Penobscot, Somerset, and Washington counties.

A movement for Maine statehood began as early as 1785, and in the following years, several conventions were held to effect this. Starting in 1792, five popular votes were taken but all failed to reach the necessary majorities. During the War of 1812, British and Canadian forces occupied a large portion of Maine including everything from the Penobscot River east to the New Brunswick border with the goal of annexing them to Canada as the Colony of New Ireland. A weak response by Massachusetts to this occupation and possible British annexation contributed to increased calls in the district for statehood.

==Statehood==
The Massachusetts General Court passed enabling legislation on June 19, 1819, separating the District of Maine from the rest of the Commonwealth. The following month, on July 19, voters in the district approved statehood by 17,091 to 7,132.
The results of the election were presented to the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council on August 24, 1819. The Maine Constitution was unanimously approved by the 210 delegates to the Maine Constitutional Convention in October 1819. On February 25, 1820, the General Court passed a follow-up measure officially accepting the fact of Maine&#x27;s imminent statehood.

At the time of Maine’s request for statehood, there were an equal number of free and slave states. Pro-slavery members of the United States Congress saw the admission of another free state, Maine, as a threat to the balance between slave and free states. They would support statehood for Maine only if Missouri Territory, where slavery was legal, would be admitted to the Union as a slave state. Maine became the nation&#x27;s 23rd state on March 15, 1820, following the Missouri Compromise, which allowed Missouri to enter the Union as a slave-holding state and Maine as a free state.

<text>The is a one-man &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft that was developed by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force during the closing stages of World War II in 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy called this aircraft Tōka (藤花, &quot;Wisteria Blossom&quot;).

==Historical context==
The aircraft&#x27;s intended purpose was to be used in &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks on Allied shipping and the invasion fleet expected to be involved in the invasion of Japan, Operation Downfall, which, in the end, did not take place.

Because the Japanese High Command thought that Japan did not have enough obsolete aircraft to use for &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, it was decided that huge numbers of cheap, simple suicide planes should be constructed quickly in anticipation of the invasion of Japan.

==Construction==
The aircraft was very simple, being made from &quot;non-strategic&quot; materials (mainly wood and steel). To save weight, it was to use a jettisonable undercarriage (there was to be no landing), so a simple, welded steel tube undercarriage was attached to the aircraft. This, however, was found to give unmanageable ground-handling characteristics, so a simple shock absorber was then incorporated. The cross section of the fuselage was circular and not elliptical, as were most planes of this size and type; such a fuselage was easier to make.

&quot;Tsurugi&quot; had an instrument panel with some flight instruments, rudder pedals, a joystick type control column, and a place for a radio. Flight controls included both ailerons and elevators and (in production versions) flaps.

The Ki-115 was designed to be able to use any engine that was in storage for ease of construction and supply and to absorb Japan&#x27;s stocks of obsolete engines from the 1920s and 1930s. The initial aircraft (Ki-115a) were powered by Nakajima Ha-35 radial engines. It is not known if any other engine was ever actually fitted.

After testing, the first production aircraft were fitted with the improved undercarriage and two rocket units. These may have assisted with take-off or may have been designed for the final acceleration towards the target.

==Performance==
The aircraft had a top speed of and could carry a bomb weighing as much as , large enough to split a warship in two. However, as it was otherwise unarmed and heavily laden with its bomb, it would have made an easy target for enemy fighter aircraft.

The aircraft&#x27;s controls were crude, its visibility terrible, and its performance abysmal. &quot;Tsurugi&quot; had very poor take-off and landing performance and could not be safely flown by anyone other than experienced pilots. There were fatal crashes during testing and training. However, new, better versions with improved controls and better visibility were under intensive development. The Japanese High Command had plans to construct some 8,000 per month in workshops all across Japan. The War ended before any flew in combat though. Individually, they would have been rather inefficient weapons, but, used in waves of hundreds or thousands, they could have been quite destructive.

==Variants==
* Ki-115 Prototype: Single-seat suicide attack aircraft. prototype version, tested during early 1945.
* Ki-115 &quot;Tsurugi&quot;: Single-seat suicide attack aircraft, production version.
* Ki-115b &quot;Tsurugi&quot;: Single-seat suicide attack aircraft. proposed version using larger wooden wing, none built.
* Ki-230: Single-seat suicide attack aircraft. projected version, none built.

==Surviving aircraft==
Of the 105 examples produced, two airframes are known to exist. 
* Ki-115 &quot;1002&quot; is on display at the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona, and is on loan from the National Air and Space Museum. 
* Another, once displayed as a gate guardian at Yokota Air Base, was since 1952 turned over to Japanese authorities and is reportedly at a Japanese museum.

<text>Karl Theodor Robert Luther (16 April 1822, Świdnica – 15 February 1900 Düsseldorf), normally published as Robert Luther, was a German astronomer. While working at the Bilk Observatory in Düsseldorf, Germany, he searched for asteroids and discovered 24 of them between 1852 and 1890. Seven times Lalande Prize winner.

==Biography==
Karl Theodor Robert Luther was born on 16 April 1822 to August Luther and Wilhelmine von Ende. He was home schooled and studied in the local high school. In 1841, he moved to Breslau where he studied until 1843.

In 1843 Luther moved to Berlin to study astronomy. He was a student of Johann Franz Encke and helped him in his astronomical calculations and creating the astronomical almanac. In 1850 he became a second observer.
In 1851, Franz Brünnow invited Luther to the Düsseldorf-Bilk Observatory to become a director of the observatory after him.

Luther married Caroline (nee Marker) and they had one son, William. Luther died in 1900 after a short illness in Düsseldorf.

==Discoveries==
Luther discovered 24 asteroids between 1852 and 1890.

Two of his discoveries are now known to have unusual properties: 90 Antiope, a binary asteroid with equal components, and the extremely slow-rotating 288 Glauke.

==Honors and awards==
The asteroid 1303 Luthera and the lunar crater &quot;Luther&quot; were named in his honour.

He was awarded the Lalande Prize seven times, in 1852, 1853, 1854, 1855, 1859, 1860 and 1861.

Royal Astronomical Society Fellow since June 1854.

In 1869, a commemorative medal honoring the discovery of the 100th asteroid shows the profiles of John Russel Hind, Hermann Goldschmidt and Robert Luther.

<doc id="583067" wikidata="Q4983418" url="?curid=583067" title="Buckminster">
<text>Buckminster is a village and civil parish within the Melton district of Leicestershire, England, which includes the two villages of Buckminster and Sewstern. The total population of the civil parish was 335 at the 2021 census. It is on the B676 road, 10 miles east of Melton Mowbray and 4 miles west of the A1 at Colsterworth.

The parish is located in the north-east of the county, on the border with Lincolnshire. Nearby places are Coston, Wymondham and Sproxton in Leicestershire, and Stainby over the border in Lincolnshire. Sewstern Lane, which forms the parish boundary and the county boundary with Lincolnshire is part of the modern Viking Way. The village is noted for its autumnal colours, with many trees in the grounds and on the perimeter of Buckminster Park, on the village green, behind the houses of The Crescent and along the edges of roads and fields.

==Housing==

Buckminster&#x27;s houses reflect its history as an estate village. They include a terrace of 17 houses built in the 1810s (The Row), an attractive circlet of semi-detached properties standing in large gardens (The Crescent) and two short terraces built in 1935 and 1948 on Sproxton Road and Coston Road. There are also a small number of detached 19th-century houses, some with origins as farmhouses. A few of the older properties are built in limestone, but the predominant building material is brick. All the commercial and residential properties in the village are owned by Buckminster Estates, who are linked with the Tollemache family who live in Buckminster Park: the former home of the Earl of Dysart. The village pub is called the Tollemache Arms.

==Buckminster Park==

Buckminster Park stands to the north-east of the village. It was never a medieval hunting park, but has its origins in a lease of land in 1532 near the former manor house. Buckminster Hall, a large Palladian-style property, was built within the park in the 1790s for Sir William Manners. This was demolished in 1951. It was replaced in 1965 by a Neo-Georgian house, by Wills, Trenwith and Wills, known as Buckminster Park. The large stables, built around a courtyard for the 9th earl of Dysart in the 1880s, stand to the south of the Park, and have been converted to housing.

The parish church of St John the Baptist was built during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries and was restored and improved in 1883. It is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;the monastery church of Bucca&#x27;.

Buckminster stands 500 feet above sea level, with no higher ground between the village and The Wash, on the east coast, 37 miles away. A beacon was built during the Anglo-Spanish War of the 16th century, as part of a chain of beacons stretching from the Lincolnshire coast. Repairs were ordered in 1625, after the countries returned to war, when a 24-hour watch had to be maintained.

For most of its history Buckminster has been a small, agricultural village. Its character changed from the 1790s, when Sir William Manners decided to move to the village and built Buckminster Hall. Two large terraces were constructed between 1795 and 1820, known as Bull Row and Cow Row. These were let to tenants who worked across Sir William&#x27;s estate in Leicestershire and Lincolnshire. Sir William&#x27;s mother was Lady Louisa Talmash, who became the 7th Countess of Dysart in 1821, following the death of her brother. Sir William became the heir to the earldom, took the surname Talmash (later Tollemache) and the courtesy title Lord Huntingtower. His great grandson, the 9th earl of Dysart, who inherited in 1878, spent heavily on village improvements. These included the demolition of the Bull Row terrace and its replacement with higher-quality semi-detached family homes, the creation of reading rooms in 1886, which became Buckminster Institute in 1898 (the forerunner to the Village Hall), the restoration of St John the Baptist church and the building of a new village school.

Land to the south and east of Buckminster village was quarried for ironstone between 1948 and 1968 on a rolling opencast basis, with the fields returned to agricultural use within a season. The result can be seen in the landscape, with the fields in the quarried area, including around the school, lying some 7 to 15 feet below the level of other roads. The reinstatement of the land encouraged a switch from pastoral to arable farming.

An underground nuclear monitoring bunker opened in 1961. It was decommissioned in 1991, and has subsequently been restored as a heritage site.

The early 21st century has seen further changes, including the renovation of old buildings to create offices and the installation of fast broadband.

==Church and Mausoleum==

The village name suggests there may have been a minster church here, but no architectural or documentary evidence of one survives. The present Church of St John the Baptist, Buckminster was mostly built between 1250 and 1350, of limestone. Unusually, the tower and broach spire are above the eastern end of the south aisle. The exterior of the church is richly decorated with carvings, which include faces on the pinnacles and a carved frieze. Inside are carved corbels, and an unusual turret containing a newel-staircase at the south-east corner of the nave, which would have led to the rood loft, and still provides access to the bells. 
The Dysart mausoleum stands to the east of the church, and is surrounded by railings. It was designed by Halsey Ricardo and built by the trustees of the estate of Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, who died in 1878. It is a Grade II* listed building.

==Facilities==

There is a village shop on Main Street. The village hall was built in 2012, just off Main Street, and has generous parking for evening events. Buckminster Barn provides a venue for day conferences, weddings and other events. The Tollemache Arms, on Main Street, is the only licensed premises in the village, and has a restaurant.

Buckminster Primary School is half a mile south of Buckminster village, on the road to Sewstern. It was rated as Good by Ofsted in 2014.
Buckminster Gliding Club based at nearby Saltby Airfield is named after the village. Buckminster United Football Club is an amateur football club based in the village.

<text>The Royal Australian Mint is the national mint of Australia, and the primary production facility for the country’s circulating coins. The mint is a Commonwealth Government entity operating within the portfolio of the Treasury, and is situated in the Australian capital city of Canberra, in the suburb of Deakin. The current facility was opened in 1965 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

Before the opening of the Australian Mint, Australian coins were struck at the Sydney Mint, Melbourne Mint and Perth Mint. As such, the Royal Australian Mint was the first mint in Australia to be independent of the British Royal Mint, in the United Kingdom, which was a British government entity. (Of the three older Australian mints, only Perth Mint has remained; it was a subsidiary of the UK Royal Mint until 1970.)

==Foundations and history==
Planning for the mint started in 1959 when it was proposed to move the Melbourne branch of the Royal Mint to Canberra, with a large site in the Canberra suburb of Deakin chosen. The Chief Designing Architect in the Commonwealth Department of Works, Richard Ure, was responsible for the International style design of the mint. It was officially opened by The Duke of Edinburgh on 22 February 1965, coinciding with the introduction of the Australian decimal currency on 14 February 1966. The mint project cost £4.5 million, with Prime Minister Harold Holt noting at the official opening: &quot;We believe that, not only have we achieved a gracious and dignified building in a national setting, but we have a mint also which incorporates the best equipment and most modern minting techniques.&quot; The main administration building was constructed by Civil and Civic, while the process building was completed by E. S. Clementson Pty Ltd.

The new mint and the Melbourne Mint operated concurrently while sufficient stockpiles of new coinage were prepared and until it was felt that production in Canberra was proceeding smoothly, after which in 1967 the Melbourne mint was closed. Some staff from the Melbourne mint relocated to Canberra to operate the new mint. However, it was not until the early 1980s that the RAM was able to sustain solitary production of the full set of circulating Australian coins, and so on several occasions in the 1960s and 1970s the RAM contracted production runs to the Perth Mint, the Royal Mint in both London and Llantrisant, and even on one occasion the Royal Canadian Mint.

The mint consists of two buildings, an administration building, and a process building. The administration building houses the engravers, a laboratory, and a vibration-free basement where coinage is measured to ensure correct size and weight.

The mint is an Australian Public Service agency, staffed through the Department of the Treasury.

During 1984-1986, renovations were carried out to support the increasing demand for the production of collector coins, and also to improve the visitor facilities. Visitors can mint their own legal tender coin using visitor presses.

The mint serves primarily to manufacture Australia&#x27;s legal tender precious metal coins. Notes are produced by Note Printing Australia in Melbourne. The mint also produces medals for military and civilian honours, most notably the Order of Australia. The mint produced medals for the 2000 Summer Olympics in conjunction with the Perth Mint. The Royal Australian Mint also produces tokens made for commercial organisations such as casinos, car washes etc.

Since its opening, the mint has produced over fifteen billion coins and has the capacity to produce two million coins per day. Coins have also been struck for several Asian and South Pacific nations, including New Zealand (in 1969), Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Western Samoa, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Estonia, Bangladesh, Israel, and the Philippines.

In November 2001, the mint issued the world&#x27;s first coin with a double hologram, to commemorate the centenary of Australian federation. The mint also creates bi-metallic coins, and colour printed coins.

On 11 December 2005, the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works tabled a report recommending the refurbishment of the Royal Australian Mint with a projected cost of A$41.2 million. Work was planned to commence in October 2006 with completion dates of June 2008 for the process building, and April 2009 for the administration building.

The refurbishment also planned to introduce industrial robots to the manufacturing process. The work was completed in 2009, and the mint is now open to the public.

In 2014, the Abbott government announced a scoping study into selling the Royal Australian Mint.

<doc id="583073" wikidata="Q1423946" url="?curid=583073" title="Segmentation (biology)">
<text>Segmentation in biology is the division of some animal and plant body plans into a linear series of repetitive segments that may or may not be interconnected to each other. This article focuses on the segmentation of animal body plans, specifically using the examples of the taxa Arthropoda, Chordata, and Annelida. These three groups form segments by using a &quot;growth zone&quot; to direct and define the segments. While all three have a generally segmented body plan and use a growth zone, they use different mechanisms for generating this patterning. Even within these groups, different organisms have different mechanisms for segmenting the body. Segmentation of the body plan is important for allowing free movement and development of certain body parts. It also allows for regeneration in specific individuals.

==Definition==
Segmentation is a difficult process to satisfactorily define. Many taxa (for example the molluscs) have some form of serial repetition in their units but are not conventionally thought of as segmented. Segmented animals are those considered to have organs that were repeated, or to have a body composed of self-similar units, but usually it is the parts of an organism that are referred to as being segmented.

==Embryology==

Segmentation in animals typically falls into three types, characteristic of different arthropods, vertebrates, and annelids. Arthropods such as the fruit fly form segments from a field of equivalent cells based on transcription factor gradients. Vertebrates like the zebrafish use oscillating gene expression to define segments known as somites. Annelids such as the leech use smaller blast cells budded off from large teloblast cells to define segments.

===Arthropods===
Although &quot;Drosophila&quot; segmentation is not representative of the arthropod phylum in general, it is the most highly studied. Early screens to identify genes involved in cuticle development led to the discovery of a class of genes that was necessary for proper segmentation of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryo.

To properly segment the &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryo, the anterior-posterior axis is defined by maternally supplied transcripts giving rise to gradients of these proteins. This gradient then defines the expression pattern for gap genes, which set up the boundaries between the different segments. The gradients produced from gap gene expression then define the expression pattern for the pair-rule genes. The pair-rule genes are mostly transcription factors, expressed in regular stripes down the length of the embryo. These transcription factors then regulate the expression of segment polarity genes, which define the polarity of each segment. Boundaries and identities of each segment are later defined.

Within the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are segmented, as are the appendages (when they are present). Some of these elements (e.g. musculature) are not segmented in their sister taxon, the onychophora.

===Annelids: Leech===
While not as well studied as in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and zebrafish, segmentation in the leech has been described as “budding” segmentation. Early divisions within the leech embryo result in teloblast cells, which are stem cells that divide asymmetrically to create bandlets of blast cells. Furthermore, there are five different teloblast lineages (N, M, O, P, and Q), with one set for each side of the midline. The N and Q lineages contribute two blast cells for each segment, while the M, O, and P lineages only contribute one cell per segment. Finally, the number of segments within the embryo is defined by the number of divisions and blast cells. Segmentation appears to be regulated by the gene Hedgehog, suggesting its common evolutionary origin in the ancestor of arthropods and annelids.

Within the annelids, as with the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are generally segmented. However, this is not true for all of the traits all of the time: many lack segmentation in the body wall, coelom and musculature.

===Chordates===
Although perhaps not as well understood as &quot;Drosophila,&quot; the embryological process of segmentation has been studied in many vertebrate groups, such as fish (Zebrafish, Medaka), reptiles (Corn Snake), birds (Chicken), and mammals (Mouse). Segmentation in chordates is characterized as the formation of a pair of somites on either side of the midline. This is often referred to as somitogenesis.

In vertebrates, segmentation is most often explained in terms of the clock and wavefront model. The &quot;clock&quot; refers to the periodic oscillation in abundance of specific gene products, such as members of the Hairy and Enhancer of Split (Hes) gene family. Expression starts at the posterior end of the embryo and moves towards the anterior, creating travelling waves of gene expression. The &quot;wavefront&quot; is where clock oscillations arrest, initiating gene expression that leads to the patterning of somite boundaries. The position of the wavefront is defined by a decreasing posterior-to-anterior gradient of FGF signalling. In higher vertebrates including Mouse and Chick, (but not Zebrafish), the wavefront also depends upon an opposing anterior-to-posterior decreasing gradient of retinoic acid which limits the anterior spreading of FGF8; retinoic acid repression of Fgf8 gene expression defines the wavefront as the point at which the concentrations of both retinoic acid and diffusible FGF8 protein are at their lowest. Cells at this point will mature and form a pair of somites. The interaction of other signaling molecules, such as myogenic regulatory factors, with this gradient promotes the development of other structures, such as muscles, across the basic segments. Lower vertebrates such as zebrafish do not require retinoic acid repression of caudal Fgf8 for somitogenesis due to differences in gastrulation and neuromesodermal progenitor function compared to higher vertebrates.

===Other taxa===
In other taxa, there is some evidence of segmentation in some organs, but this segmentation is not pervasive to the full list of organs mentioned above for arthropods and annelids. One might think of the serially repeated units in many Cycloneuralia, or the segmented body armature of the chitons (which is not accompanied by a segmented coelom).

==Origin==
Segmentation can be seen as originating in two ways. To caricature, the &#x27;amplification&#x27; pathway would involve a single-segment ancestral organism becoming segmented by repeating itself. This seems implausible, and the &#x27;parcellization&#x27; framework is generally preferred – where existing organization of organ systems is &#x27;formalized&#x27; from loosely defined packets into more rigid segments. As such, organisms with a loosely defined metamerism, whether internal (as some molluscs) or external (as onychophora), can be seen as &#x27;precursors&#x27; to eusegmented organisms such as annelids or arthropods.

<text>American Greetings Corporation is a privately held American company and is the world&#x27;s second largest greeting card producer behind Hallmark Cards. Based in Westlake, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, the company sells paper greeting cards, electronic greeting cards, gift packaging, stickers and party products. In addition, the company owns the Carlton Cards, Tender Thoughts, Papyrus, Recycled Paper Greetings and Gibson brands.

American Greetings&#x27; former toy design and licensing division, initially called Those Characters From Cleveland, subsequently renamed AG Properties and American Greetings Entertainment and now separately owned as Cloudco Entertainment. American Greetings also holds an exclusive license for Nickelodeon characters.

==History==
===Sapirstein Greeting Card===
Sapirstein Greeting Card Co. was founded in 1906 by Polish immigrant Jacob Sapirstein (1885–1987), who sold cards to stores from a horse-drawn cart, American Greetings has been run by members of the family since its inception. Irving Sapirstein, Jacob&#x27;s oldest son, became Jacob&#x27;s first partner in 1918 at age nine. Irving&#x27;s brother Morris started working at the card company in 1926. Morris and Irving in 1928 got a post card contract worth $24,000. The company started using self-serve display cabinets for its greeting cards in 1929 further cementing its position in the market. Sapirstein Greeting began in 1932 making its own greeting cards.

In 1934, the company began hiring sales representatives. Harry, the youngest son, joined the business in 1935. In 1936, the company opened its first branch office and the first major manufacturing facility.

===American Greetings===
Sapirstein Greeting Card Co. was renamed in 1938 to American Greetings Publishers. In 1939, the firm first issued the Forget-Me-Not card line. Irving and his brothers changed their last name to Stone in the 1940s. American Greeting Publishers was incorporated in 1944. John Sands Pty. Ltd. of Sydney, Australia and the company signed a licensing agreement, the firm&#x27;s first, in 1949.

The company changed its name to American Greetings Corporation as the company went public in 1952, issuing 200,000 shares. The funds raised were earmarked for acquisitions and expansion. In 1956, American Greetings formed Carlton Cards, Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary. Also that year, the Hi Brows humor studio card line was launched.

In July 1957, the company moved its headquarters to One American Road, Brooklyn, Ohio. In 1958, American Greetings went public. Jacob Sapirstein became chairman of the board while Irving assumed the company&#x27;s president post in 1960. In Forest City, North Carolina, the company built a cabinet manufacturing plant in 1960. A Mexican subsidiary in Mexico City was set up in 1969. In 1971, a retail subsidiary was formed called Summit Corporation, later called Carlton Cards Retail, Inc.

Holly Hobbie premiered in 1967 as a line of greeting cards by American Greetings. The character&#x27;s public appeal lead to the formation of Those Characters From Cleveland Inc. Sale the next year topped $100 million. In 1972, the company introduced Ziggy, created by Tom Wilson, which soon had a newspaper cartoon strip generating additional income. By 1977, Holly Hobbie became one of the top female licensed character in the world.

Morry Weiss, Irving&#x27;s son-in-law, and Irving Stone in 1978 were appointed president and chairman &amp; CEO, respectively. Also that year, the corporation set up two new subsidiaries Plus Mark, Inc. and A.G. Industries, Inc. Plus Mark was formed to manufacture Christmas gift wrap, boxed cards, and accessories. A.G. Industries was a display fixture manufacturer. American Greeting had seen itself as a mass-marketer and was serving pharmacies, variety stores, discount stores, and supermarkets with low cost cards. Meanwhile, Hallmark Cards ignored the mass market outlets until 1959 with issuance of its Ambassador card line. The company then used its licensing revenue on national advertising and other efforts to gain market share from 1981 to 1985. While they had a net income increase of 613 percent over ten years, Hallmark still maintained its market share. Gibson Greetings started a price war in 1986 and ended in 1987 which had the three major greeting card companies taking a loss. With a drop in licensing revenue, American took until 1989 to recover.

Those Characters From Cleveland was started up by Tom Wilson on behalf of American Greetings in 1980. The first property out of Those Characters was Strawberry Shortcake, which generated in 1981 $500 million in retail sales, followed by the Care Bears with $2 billion in sales over its first two years.

AG came back with a doubled net income by 1991 with 10 percent growth in sales to Hallmark&#x27;s 1 percent. Weiss was promoted to CEO while Ed Fruchtenbaum was elevated as the fourth and first non-family president. Weiss had streamlined operations, cut costs, and decreased its card idea development time frame to market. Fruchtenbaum stressed information systems technology with the development of software to aid the sales force, to managers and their retailers in order to track inventories and trends. The following year, Weiss and Fruchtenbaum were promoted again to chairman/CEO and president/chief operating officer, respectively, with Irving Stone becoming founder-chairman.

Custom Expressions, Inc., the CreataCard producer, was acquired in 1992, The CreataCard units had 1,000 card options and printed cards in under four minutes for $3.50 each. The company placed a few thousand units in mass-merchandise outlets in the US. By early 1994, 7,000 were installed. The kiosks generated modest profits off healthy revenue. With the Touch Screen Greetings and the Personalize It! method, Hallmark in 1992 sued AG over patent infringement with a 1995 settlement that allow both to use the technology worldwide. By 1995, the kiosks were being left behind by personal computers and the internet. The units were partially written off. American had also made deals with online services, Prodigy, CompuServe, and Microsoft Network in early 1996. Their website was redesigned to allow the cards to be designed on the website then mailed from its Cleveland fulfillment center in 1997. Two CD-ROM products, Personal CardShop for Home and Office and CreataCard Plus, were published. Both allowed for personalization. CardShop had 150 card choices and used the modem to order them to be printed and mailed by their fulfillment center. CreataCard had 3,000 predesigned greeting cards, invitations, stationery, and announcements, and three methods of fulfillment: print on home printer, by e-mail or via the company&#x27;s center.

In the mid-1990s, American Greetings expanded its operations with acquisitions or starting up of new lines of business, and starting in 1996, the promotion of sideline product categories to semi-autonomous units. A reading glasses manufacturer, Magnivision, was purchased in 1993. In 1996, the party goods line was relaunched under the DesignWare name. The same year, American Greetings entered discussions with BEC Group Inc. to acquire Foster Grant Group, a sunglasses manufacturer, but declined to pursue the purchase. A candle line was relaunched in 1997 under the name GuildHouse. A supplemental educational products subsidiary, Learning Horizons, Inc., was set up in March 1997, but in August American Greetings sold two subsidiaries, Acme Frame Products, Inc. and Wilhold Inc., producer of hair accessory products, to Newell Company. Contempo Colours, a party goods company in Michigan with licenses including &quot;Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, was bought in August 1999 to add to DesignWare.

In Canada, the Forget-Me-Not brand was launched in 1993. In July 1997, American Greetings launched its &quot;The All New American Way&quot; marketing strategy that consisted of massive revamping of its everyday card lines over the next year and a half to meet nine American cultural trends.

In the 1990s, American Greetings pushed more into international markets. Acquisition occurred in 1995 with a purchase of 80% share of S.A. Greetings Corporation in South Africa and in 1996 with the purchase of John Sands, the top greeting card company in both Australia and New Zealand. In 1998, Camden Graphics Group and Hanson White Ltd. were purchased to add to its UK operations, while in 1999, a majority stake in Memory Lane Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian greeting card company, brought American to Asia for the first time.

American Greetings made a bid for Gibson Greetings, the third top card maker in the US, in March 1996, which was rejected. In 1999, the company agreed to buy rival Gibson Greetings and united the second and third largest U.S. greeting card makers. Through the Gibson purchase, American gained its strong UK unit and a 27% stake in Egreetings Network Inc.

In 1998, the company shares moved from trading on the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange. AmericanGreetings.com, Inc., while not turning a profit, was announced in June 1999 to be taken public, but was withdrew due to the early 2000 tech stock collapse.

In March 1999, Hallmark started a price war with the introduction of a 99-cent card line forcing American to do the same. In 1999, the implementation of a new inventory system slowed shipments to retailers, but this reduced sales by $100 million, a 1.5% decrease, ending a 93rd consecutive year of increasing revenue.

Fruchtenbaum was terminated in June 2000 for insider trading policy violation after the board learned that he purchased stock via options, then sold them in December 1998 before the announcement of the new inventory system implementation&#x27;s expected loss. Board member James C. Spira was then appointed vice-chairman.

In November 2000, Spira was appointed to oversee a massive overhaul. The company cut 1,500 jobs, closed six manufacturing and distribution centers, discontinued Forget-Me-Not, one of its four main U.S. card brands, and cut the offered greeting cards to 10,000 from 15,000. The firm also shifted to recognizing sales at the retailer&#x27;s register, not when it was stocked on the retailer&#x27;s shelves in order to better control inventory. This cost them $300 million, and was highly unprofitable in the 2001 and 2002 fiscal years.

In its online sector in 2001, American Greeting purchased the Egreetings Network shares that Gibson did not already own. In January 2002, the company purchased Blue Mountain Arts (BlueMountain.com) from Excite@Home with Excite to buy ads on American Greeting websites and Blue Mountain would continue providing ecards for Excite. The company thus had four online greeting cards website including BeatGreets.com, a musical greetings website. While the online operations expected to become profitable by the fourth quarter 2002, the division had a lower loss than in the prior year.

In 2003, Morry Weiss&#x27;s sons, Zev and Jeffrey, became CEO and President respectively; Morry Weiss remained Chairman. American Greetings had also branched out onto the internet and owned a network of websites. In October 2007, American Greetings bought Webshots from CNET for $45 million in cash.

In July 2004, American Greetings sold MagniVision to an affiliate of Foster Grant sunglasses manufacturer. In October 2005, American Greetings recalled its &quot;Sesame Street&quot; toy sunglasses sold from December 2003 through August 2005, because the lenses can separate from the frames, posing a choking hazard to young children.

American Greetings purchased Recycled Paper Greetings in February 2009. Two months later, in two cash deals with Schurman Fine Papers on April 17, the company sold its remaining 341 stores to them, and in the second deal bought Schurman&#x27;s wholesale division, Papyrus brand cards and paper products, and a 15% equity stake in Schurman.

In April 2010, the company closed its DesignWare plant in Kalamazoo as the company moved to Amscan for manufacturing their party goods. American Greetings received $25 million and a warrant for 2 percent of common stock in AAH Holdings, Amscan&#x27;s parent corporation, while Amscan received inventory, equipment and processes. In Mexico, the company moved strategically to a third party distributor model and closed its warehouse there.

In 2010, American Greetings planned to move its headquarters from Brooklyn, Ohio to a new facility at Crocker Park within the nearby city of Westlake, but in 2013, the company delayed to move its operations to Westlake. Construction had been scheduled to start in early 2013. In 2014, American Greetings sold its Brooklyn, Ohio headquarters to developers and began renting its current offices from the new owners until the move to Westlake. American Greetings opened their new Westlake headquarters in September 2016. The company leases the building from the Wiess family until August 2031.

American Greetings forced Clinton Cards PLC in May 2012 into administration. In June, American Greetings acquired assets from Clinton Cards together with some of its subsidiaries including UK Greetings. UK Greetings&#x27; card brands at the time were Camden Graphics, Hanson White, Forget Me Not and Xpressions. Clinton operated stores under the Clinton and Birthdays brands. American Greetings brought in Dominique Schurman, CEO of Schurman Retail Group, to lead Clinton.

===Private corporation===
American Greetings went private once again in mid-2013, thus removing itself from all the public markets, agreeing to pay $18.20 per share, valuing the company at $878 million. The Weiss family-owned Century Intermediate Holding Co. purchased the public shares.

In 2018, the Weiss family sold a 60% majority stake of the company to the investment firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R). The Weiss Family would continue to operate as directors and shareholders of American Greetings as well as retain ownership of American Greetings Entertainment, which was spun off as Cloudco Entertainment. UK Greetings continued with American Greetings under CD&amp;R while the Clintons retail chain in the UK remained with the Weiss family. On closing of the deal, David Scheible was named Chairman in place of Morry Weiss and President John Beeder was promoted to CEO (the former chairman and co-CEOs remaining on the board). In January 2019, the Weiss family placed AG&#x27;s headquarters up for sale.

Scheible had been replaced by John Compton as chairman. On March 1, 2019, the retiring CEO Beeder was replaced by Joe Arcuri. In January 2020, partially owned Schurman Retail Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, resulting in the closing of all of its stores, including American Greetings locations.

==Gibson Greetings==
Acquired in 1999, Gibson was founded by brothers George, Robert, Samuel and Stephen in 1855 as Gibson &amp; Company, Lithographers in Cincinnati. It eventually began making greeting cards in 1860s and 1870s, sold to brother George as Gibson Arts in 1883 and Gibson Greeting Cards Inc. in 1960. After being under RCA Corporation and other owners it was sold to American Greetings.

<doc id="583084" wikidata="Q2894589" url="?curid=583084" title="Bell Biv DeVoe">
<text>Bell Biv DeVoe, also known as BBD, is an American music group from Boston, Massachusetts, formed from members of New Edition, consisting of Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe.

The band is best known for their debut album, the multi-platinum selling &quot;Poison&quot;, a key work in the new jack swing movement of the 1990s that combined elements of traditional soul and R&amp;B with hip hop. Two singles from the album, &quot;Poison&quot; and &quot;Do Me!&quot;, both reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990. The band released three more albums, though none had the success of their debut. Their most recent album &quot;Three Stripes&quot; came out on January 27, 2017.

Despite only producing four albums of original material in a 31-year span, the group has continuously toured and performed live, both as an act on their own and on several New Edition reunion tours.

==History==
The trio of Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe has their origins as founders of the Boston-based quintet New Edition, which had gained notice of famed producer Maurice Starr at a talent show in 1981, and as children had several hits with songs like &quot;Candy Girl&quot; and &quot;Cool It Now&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s, the line-up changed and the group matured and sought to branch out in new musical directions. During a hiatus in 1989, and at the suggestion of producers Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, the three decided to form a new group, and were signed by MCA Records. With help from Public Enemy producers Eric Sadler, Hank and Keith Shocklee and several others, Bell Biv Devoe released its debut album &quot;Poison&quot; in 1990, an album credited as pioneering the &quot;new jack swing&quot; sound of the early 1990s, combining hip-hop, funk, soul, and pop music. This fusion of styles helped to expose them to a fan base which preferred a harder edged sound. &quot;Poison&quot; reached number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart, and its title track, along with its second single, &quot;Do Me!&quot;, both reached number 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart. Shortly thereafter, Richard Wolf and Epic Mazur were responsible for the remix of &quot;Do Me!&quot; (which hit number six on the dance charts). &quot;Poison&quot; also spawned the singles &quot;B.B.D. (I Thought It Was Me)?&quot;, &quot;When Will I See You Smile Again?&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Dope!&quot; &quot;Poison&quot; sold over four million copies, and was followed up by a remix album titled &quot;WBBD-Bootcity&quot;.

In 1992, Bell Biv DeVoe featured on the US Top 10 single &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot;, a duet between American singers Luther Vandross and Janet Jackson, recorded for the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced soundtrack to the 1992 American film &quot;Mo&#x27; Money&quot;. 

Bell Biv DeVoe released &quot;Hootie Mack&quot; in 1993 on MCA Records, and the more hardcore rap/R&amp;B influenced &quot;BBD&quot; in 2001 on Biv 10 Records. Neither album was as successful as &quot;Poison&quot;, though &quot;Hootie Mack&quot; did reach Gold success. Despite the fact that the group has only released four albums, the members of Bell Biv Devoe continue to perform together as a group. They also participated in several New Edition reunions, and continue to perform with them on tour as part of the group. On May 30, 2013, Bell Biv DeVoe performed their hit song &quot;Poison&quot; for Boston Strong, a benefit concert to raise money for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.

In 2016, BBD released their first track in 15 years, &quot;Run,&quot; along with an accompanying music video. It was the first single off the album &quot;Three Stripes&quot;, which was released January 27, 2017.

In 2023, they performed the national anthem with The Boston Pops Orchestra at the 2023 Winter Classic.

On October 5 2023, BBD released a new single entitled, &quot;Act Like You Know&quot; featuring Rev Run.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1991, the group received the award for Best R&amp;B/Urban Contemporary Album of the Year, Group, Band or Duo for &quot;Poison&quot; at the Soul Train Music Awards.

The group also received an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Band/Duo/Group in 1992.

<doc id="583094" wikidata="Q712683" url="?curid=583094" title="Percy Faith">
<text>Percy Faith (April 7, 1908 – February 9, 1976) was a Canadian–American bandleader, orchestrator, composer and conductor, known for his lush arrangements of instrumental ballads and Christmas standards. He is often credited with popularizing the &quot;easy listening&quot; or &quot;mood music&quot; format. He became a staple of American popular music in the 1950s and continued well into the 1960s. Although his professional orchestra-leading career began at the height of the swing era, he refined and rethought orchestration techniques, including use of large string sections, to soften and fill out the brass-dominated popular music of the 1940s.

==Biography==
Faith was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was the oldest of eight children. His parents, Abraham Faith and Minnie, née Rottenberg, were Jewish. He played violin and piano as a child, and played in theatres and at Massey Hall. After his hands were badly burned in a fire, he turned to conducting, and his live orchestras used the new medium of radio broadcasting. He moved from Canada to Great Neck, New York and became a United States citizen.

Beginning with stations CKNC and CKCL, Faith was a staple of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s live-music broadcasting from 1933 to 1940, when he resettled in Chicago, Illinois. In the early 1940s, Faith was orchestra leader for the Carnation Contented program on NBC. From 1948 to 1949 he also served as the orchestra leader on the CBS radio network program &quot;The Coca-Cola Hour&quot; (also called &quot;The Pause That Refreshes&quot;). The orchestral accordionist John Serry Sr. collaborated with Faith in these broadcasts. He also led the orchestra on &quot;The Woolworth Hour&quot; on CBS radio (1955–1957).

In 1945, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He made many recordings for Voice of America. After working briefly for Decca Records, he worked for Mitch Miller at Columbia Records, where he turned out dozens of albums and provided arrangements for many of the pop singers of the 1950s, including Tony Bennett, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis for Mathis&#x27;s 1958 Christmas album titled &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, and Guy Mitchell for whom Faith co-wrote with Carl Sigman Mitchell&#x27;s number-one single, &quot;My Heart Cries for You&quot;.

His most famous and remembered recordings are &quot;Delicado&quot; (1952), &quot;The Song from &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;&quot; (1953) and &quot;Theme from &quot;A Summer Place&quot;&quot; (1959), which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1961. Faith remains the only artist to have the best selling single of the year during both the pop singer era (&quot;Song from &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;&quot;) and the rock era (&quot;Theme from &quot;A Summer Place&quot;&quot;); and he is one of only three artists, along with Elvis Presley and The Beatles, to have the best selling single of the year twice. The B-side of &quot;Song from the Moulin Rouge&quot; was &quot;Swedish Rhapsody&quot; by Hugo Alfvén. In 1961 his fame in Sweden rose exponentially as his work &quot;Mucho Gusto&quot; became the theme music for the sports broadcasts of Sveriges Radio.

Although Faith initially mined the worlds of Broadway, Hollywood and Latin music for many of his top-selling 1950s recordings, he enjoyed popularity starting in 1962 with his orchestral versions of popular rock and pop hits of the day. His &quot;Themes for Young Lovers&quot; album was a top seller during this era and introduced the Faith sound to a younger generation of listeners. With the success of Columbia record-mate Ray Conniff&#x27;s chorus and orchestra during this same time, Faith began using a chorus (usually all female in most of his recordings, but used a mixed chorus on his albums &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot; and &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;, which were released in 1970 and 1971 respectively) in several popular albums from the mid-1960s on. Faith&#x27;s first single with a female chorus, &quot;Yellow Days,&quot; was a substantial hit in the MOR (Middle of the Road) easy listening radio format of the mid-1960s. Faith continued to enjoy airplay and consistent album sales throughout the early 1970s, and received a second Grammy award in 1969 for his album &quot;Love Theme from &#x27;Romeo and Juliet&#x27;.&quot;

Although best known for his recording career, Faith also occasionally scored motion pictures, and received an Academy Award nomination for his adaptation of the song score for the Doris Day musical feature, &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot;. His other film scores included romantic comedies and dramatic features such as &quot;Tammy Tell Me True&quot; (1961), &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Rich&quot; (1964), &quot;The Third Day&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966). Faith also composed the theme for the NBC series &quot;The Virginian.&quot;

With the advent of harder rock sounds in the 1970s, Faith&#x27;s elegant arrangements fell out of favour with the listening and record-buying public, although he continued to release albums as diverse and contemporary as &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;. He released one album of country music and two albums of disco-oriented arrangements toward the end of his forty-year career, his last recording being a disco-style reworking of &quot;Theme from a Summer Place&quot;, titled &quot;Summer Place &#x27;76&quot;, which was a minor and posthumous hit. Faith died of cancer in Encino, California, and was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Faith had two children, Marilyn and Peter, with his wife Mary (née Palange), whom he married in 1928. She died in Los Angeles in 1997.

<doc id="583097" wikidata="Q2496575" url="?curid=583097" title="Brendon Small">
<text>Brendon Small (born February 15, 1975) is an American actor, stand-up comedian, writer, director, producer, and musician who is known for co-creating the animated series &quot;Home Movies&quot; (1999–2004, with Loren Bouchard) and &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; (2006–2013, with Tommy Blacha). He also writes the music, and is the main performer for the fictional melodic death metal band Dethklok, which began as the subject of &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; but has taken on a life of its own, with four albums and an occasional live touring band, headed by Small. Small has also released two albums under his own name, in a similar musical style to Dethklok.

== Early life and education ==
Small was born in Illinois in 1975. He moved to California as a child. Small started learning guitar at the age of 14 after a kid in his neighborhood began teaching him about guitar and music. At his first public performance, his hands shook so wildly that he had trouble controlling the guitar. It would be another ten years before he was comfortable performing in public. He graduated from Palma High School in Salinas, California. He graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1997. During his music studies, he took several writing and comedy classes at Emerson College. After graduating, he felt that the rock music genre was fading in popularity, so decided to try his hand at stand-up comedy.

== Career ==

=== Media ===

Small was performing stand up at The Comedy Studio in Harvard Square when he was spotted by Loren Bouchard, who at the time was casting for the central character for a UPN pilot produced by Tom Snyder Productions, which eventually evolved into &quot;Home Movies&quot;. Small and Bouchard co-created &quot;Home Movies&quot;, an animated series that initially aired on the UPN television network which moved to Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim block. The series ran for four seasons from 1999 to 2004. Small was one of the show&#x27;s writers, while Bouchard served as the director. In the series, he voiced the show&#x27;s protagonist, eight-year-old aspiring filmmaker Brendon Small, as well as a number of other characters. Small composed the show&#x27;s theme music, as well as writing and performing numerous other songs for the show&#x27;s soundtrack.

Small lent his voice to a number of other animated shows. He co-starred as Chad in the BET animated sitcom, &quot;Hey Monie!&quot;, and has voiced many supporting characters in &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, including that show&#x27;s shell shocked and drug-addicted version of Jonny Quest. Small has had cameo roles in &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, &quot;Reno 911!&quot; and &quot;Frisky Dingo&quot;. Small, along with Scott Adsit, appeared as lead characters of the Adult Swim pilot &quot;Let&#x27;s Fish&quot;; the show&#x27;s pilot premiered on May 13, 2007, but the series was not picked up.

In April 2005, the Sci Fi Channel announced an upcoming debut of a half-hour animated ensemble comedy show created by Small titled &quot;Barbarian Chronicles&quot;. The show, which has not aired, was said to be produced by Small and Worldwide Pants Incorporated. Small has said that there are no plans to air the show but that anything can happen in the future.

Small posed for a pictorial that appeared in the April 2006 issue of &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine, as part of a humor-themed issue. Small posed naked holding a medieval flail and a strategically placed metal shield that hid his genitals.

Small served as co-producer, co-writer and composer for the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, which ran for four seasons from 2006 to 2012, along with a 2013 special, &quot;&quot;. The series focused on a fictional melodic death metal band named Dethklok, and each episode features a song performed by the band. In addition to writing, directing and executive producing the series, he also provided voice talent for the characters Skwisgaar Skwigelf, Pickles, and Nathan Explosion, three of the five members of Dethklok. Small has stated that while animation is his dream job, he does not really like watching animation that much.

In 2007 and 2009, Small hosted the annual Guitar Superstar competition; in 2008, he was one of the judges.

In 2010, Small directed Soundgarden&#x27;s music video for &quot;Black Rain&quot;, and The Damned Things&#x27; music video for &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Situation Here&quot;.

Small&#x27;s virtual band Dethklok appeared, via video, at the 2009 Golden Gods Awards. The band received the award for Best International Band. At the 2010 Golden Gods Awards, Small attended and performed with Brian Posehn&#x27;s band and introduced Fear Factory&#x27;s set. At the 2011 Golden Gods Awards, Small attended and introduced DevilDriver&#x27;s set. Small attended the 2012 Golden Gods Awards and introduced Trivium&#x27;s set. He was nominated for best guitarist at the 2013 Golden Gods Awards but did not win.

In May 2014, Small wrote a column for &quot;Premier Guitar&quot; regarding his guitar techniques.

Small appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor Podcast&quot; on May 15, 2015, as part of the Bridgetown Comedy Festival in Portland, Oregon.

=== Comedy ===
Small has frequently performed stand-up comedy, first in Boston, before moving to the Los Angeles area, where he performs now. Small was one of the hosts (along with Ron Lynch and Craig Anton) of &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot;, a live weekly musical and comedic variety show; in his off-time, Small still occasionally appears as a guest. One of his prominent forms of stand-up is character comedy, where he acts out a character he created. Some of the characters he has played are Captain Moustache, Victor Diamond, Tiny and Bernie Fretts, all of which he has performed as in the comedy podcast &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot;. In recent years, Small&#x27;s time has become booked from his music and television career, but he still occasionally performs stand-up at venues such as The Steve Allen Theater, The Ice House and The Baked Potato. Small credits Monty Python, Albert Brooks, Woody Allen and the Marx Brothers as his biggest comedy influences.

=== Music career ===

Small wrote all the music for the show &quot;Home Movies&quot;, and released all the songs he had written for the show on the &quot;Home Movies&quot;: Bonus CD. The CD was included with purchase of the Season 4 DVD box set.

He wrote all the music for &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;. In September 2007, he completed work on the first Dethklok album, &quot;The Dethalbum&quot;, on which he collaborated with Gene Hoglan to deliver an authentic melodic death metal sound while simultaneously retaining the light-hearted nature with which Small portrays the heavy metal genre. The album debuted at No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the highest-ranked death metal album on the Billboard at the time.

In November 2007, Small, Hoglan, Mike Keneally and Bryan Beller performed live as Dethklok at twelve US college campuses in support of &quot;The Dethalbum&quot;. The Adult Swim-sponsored &quot;Dethtour&quot; featured Dethklok supporting indie rock band ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. The quartet reunited in 2008 to headline a longer &quot;Dethtour&quot;, where they toured the US in June and early July with fellow metal bands Chimaira and Soilent Green. During the tour they released the ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead/Dethklok split EP for free at the concerts.

The second Dethklok album, &quot;Dethalbum II&quot;, was released on September 29, 2009. &quot;Dethalbum II&quot; reached No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the highest charting death metal album in history, beating the first &quot;Dethalbum&quot;. A tour in support of the new album began in late 2009, where Dethklok co-headlined with the band Mastodon.

Small performed guest vocals as Nathan Explosion on the Zimmers Hole song &quot;The Vowel Song&quot;. Small contributed guitar work to the songs &quot;Devils Teeth&quot; from Exodus&#x27;s album &quot;Exhibit B: The Human Condition&quot;, as well as &quot;More Metal Than You&quot; from comedian Brian Posehn&#x27;s album &quot;Fart and Wiener Jokes&quot;. Small created the &quot;Murder Mix&quot; of the song &quot;Liar&quot; by Emilie Autumn from the &quot;Liar/Dead Is the New Alive&quot; EP. Small performed the solo for the song &quot;Get It Up&quot; (Van Halen cover) on Sylencers&#x27; debut album &quot;A Lethal Dose of Truth&quot;. Small performs a guitar solo on the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Out&quot; on the Sex Slaves album &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;.

In early 2011, Small introduced the Dethklok &quot;Thunderhorse&quot; Explorer from Gibson, a guitar made to his own specifications, and modeled after Skwisgaar&#x27;s Gibson Explorer. A limited edition Epiphone &quot;Thunderhorse&quot; Explorer, based on the Gibson &quot;Thunderhorse&quot; Explorer, was introduced in early 2013. In May 2012, Small introduced the prototype for the Gibson Flying V &quot;Snow Falcon&quot;, built to his own specifications, and modeled after Toki Wartooth&#x27;s Gibson Flying V. The final version of the guitar was released on December 13, 2013.

In April 2012, Small released his debut solo album, &quot;Brendon Small&#x27;s Galaktikon&quot;. The album featured Dethklok members Beller on bass and Hoglan on drums. Small described the album as a &quot;high-stakes, intergalactic, extreme rock album&quot; and described it as being similar to Dethklok but with more melodic vocals and rock elements. Small performed songs from &quot;Brendon Small&#x27;s Galaktikon&quot; for the first time at &quot;WesFest 8&quot; on March 3, 2013, in West Hollywood, California.

On April 29, 2012, Small started a weekly guitar lesson video series on the Adult Swim YouTube channel, entitled &quot;Shreducation&quot;, which consisted of 12 installments.

Small, Beller and Hoglan got together to work on the third Dethklok album, &quot;Dethalbum III&quot;, which was released on October 16, 2012. Small released a fourth Dethklok album, entitled &quot;The Doomstar Requiem&quot;, on October 29, 2013, which is a soundtrack album to the &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; . The album featured Hoglan on drums, Beller performing guest bass on a track, and Mike Keneally performing guest vocals.

Small released his second album, &quot;Brendon Small&#x27;s Galaktikon II&quot;, in 2017.

In 2021, Small released a new instrumental song, &quot;Ghosthorse,&quot; to promote his new Epiphone signature model guitar, the GhostHorse Explorer.

== BS Records ==
In 2012, Small self-released his solo album, &quot;Brendon Small&#x27;s Galaktikon&quot;, independently on his personal record label BS Records. He funded the album himself, and used all of the profits he received from the album to fund future projects. In 2013, as there was no demand from Cartoon Network&#x27;s Williams Street Records for another Dethklok album, Small released the fourth Dethklok album, &quot;The Doomstar Requiem&quot; (the soundtrack to the TV special of the same name), on BS Records instead. He stated at the time that he wanted to keep Dethklok&#x27;s music going regardless of whether it would be financially beneficial to him.

== Personal life ==
Small currently resides in Los Angeles. He had a dog named Ernie (a Weimaraner) that died in January 2014. He has since gotten a new dog named Gilda, also a Weimaraner.

Small is of Lithuanian descent. Small married interior designer Courtney Bates in 2014.

<doc id="583101" wikidata="Q157735" url="?curid=583101" title="90 Antiope">
<text>90 Antiope is a double asteroid in the outer asteroid belt. It was discovered on 1 October 1866, by Robert Luther. In 2000, it was found to consist of two almost-equally-sized bodies orbiting each other. At average diameters of about 88 km and 84 km, both components are among the 500 largest asteroids. Antiope is a member of the Themis family of asteroids that share similar orbital elements.

== Naming ==

The asteroid&#x27;s proper name comes from Greek mythology, but it is disputed whether this is Antiope the Amazon or Antiope the mother of Amphion and Zethus.

Since the discovery of Antiope&#x27;s binary nature, the name &quot;Antiope&quot; technically refers to the slightly larger of the two components, with the smaller component bearing the provisional designation S/2000 (90) 1. However, the name &quot;Antiope&quot; is also used to refer to the binary system as a whole.

== Properties ==

The most remarkable feature of Antiope is that it consists of two components of almost equal size (the difference in mass is less than 2.5%), making it a truly &quot;double&quot; asteroid. Its binary nature was discovered on 10 August 2000 by a group of astronomers using adaptive optics at the Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea. Before this, IRAS observations had suggested that the asteroid was 120 km in diameter.

=== Orbital ===

Antiope orbits in the outer third of the core region of the asteroid belt, and is a member of the Themis family.

Since each component is about 86±1 km across, with their centers separated by only about 171 kilometers, the gap separating the two halves is about the same as the diameter of each component. As a result, the two bodies orbit around the common center of mass which lies in the space between them. The orbital period is approximately 16.50 hours, and the eccentricity below 0.006. Every several years, a period of mutual occultations occurs when the asteroid is viewed from Earth. Using Kepler&#x27;s third law, the mass and density of the components can be derived from the orbital period and component sizes.

The axis of the mutual orbit of the two components points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (200°, 38°) with 2 degrees uncertainty. This is tilted about 63° to the circumsolar orbit of the system.

=== Physical ===

Antiope itself has an average diameter of about 88 km, while its twin, S/2000 (90) 1, has an average diameter of 84 km. Like most bodies in this region, the components of the Antiope system are of the dark C spectral type, indicating a carbonaceous composition. The low density () of its components (see below) suggests a significant porosity (&gt;30%), indicating rubble-pile asteroids composed of debris that accumulated in the aftermath of a previous asteroid collision, possibly the one that formed the Themis family.

Complementary observations using adaptive optic observations on 8–10 m class telescopes and mutual events photometric lightcurve over several months have served as input quantities for a derivation of a whole set of other physical parameters (shapes of the components, surface scattering, bulk density, and internal properties). The shape model is consistent with slightly non-spherical components, having a size ratio of 0.95 (with an average radius of 42.9 km), and exhibiting equilibrium figures for homogeneous rotating bodies. A comparison with grazing occultation event lightcurves taken in 2003 suggests that the real shape of the components do not depart much from Roche equilibrium figures (by more than 10%).

Observations from the VLT-UT4 telescope equipped with an adaptive optics system in 2007 and lightcurve data analysis suggest that one of the components appears to have a 68 km bowl-shaped impact crater that may be the result of a violent collision that broke proto-Antiope into two equisized bodies. The impactor is calculated to have been more than 17 km in diameter. The crater can not be resolved using the W.M. Keck II telescope.

The two parts of the Antiope have very similar spectra. This implies they may have a common origin, such as being formed from the breakup of a larger rubble-pile asteroid, but other formation scenarios cannot be ruled out.

== Occultations ==

There have been 9 occultations observed since 1988, many of which are multichord occultations.

The best is the 19 July 2011 event observed from 57 stations spread out along the western USA coast where 46 stations recorded positive occultations and 11 stations observed misses. However many of the misses were important to clearly separate the two components of 90 Antiope. Many planned stations were unfortunately clouded. Many stations were so-called Mighty-Mini or Mighty-Maxi, consisting of a binocular objective (homemade using binoculars + hacksaw + plumbing fittings) with a video camera and Video Time Inserter (VTI), and were pre-pointed and left to run unattended, thereby allowing one observer to deploy many stations.

The crater mentioned above was confirmed by this occultation.

It was named in August 2003 after Thyone, better known as Semele, mother of Dionysus in Greek mythology.

Thyone belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 million kilometres, at inclinations of roughly 150°.

<text>Department is an organizational term used by the U.S. Army, mostly prior to World War I, to describe named geographical districts created for control and administration of installations and units. In 1920, most of the named departments were redesignated as numbered Corps Areas. However, the Hawaiian, Panama Canal, and Philippine Departments retained their old names. In 1939, the Puerto Rican Department was created and in May 1941 the Panama Canal and Puerto Rican Departments were combined as the Caribbean Defense Command, although each was still referred to as a department.

== 1800s ==

=== War of 1812 ===
The United States Army was divided into nine military districts by the War Department General Order, of 19 March 1813. They were increased to ten on 2 July 1814 but reduced to nine by consolidation of the 4th and 10th Military Districts in January 1815. Military districts were abolished, 17 May 1815.

=== 1853–1861 ===
After 31 October 1853 the division echelon was eliminated and the six western departments consolidated into four (Departments of Texas, New Mexico, the West, and the Pacific), whose department commanders employed their troops as they saw fit. The system returned to six departments in 1858 when the Department of Utah was created in January, and the Department of the Pacific split into the Departments of California and Oregon in September.

=== 1861–1865 Civil War ===
During the American Civil War, a department was a geographical command within the Union&#x27;s military organization, usually reporting directly to the War Department. Many of the Union&#x27;s departments were named after rivers, such as the Department of the Potomac and the Department of the Tennessee. The geographical boundaries of such departments changed frequently, as did their names. As the armies became larger Departments began to be subordinated to Military Divisions, and the Departments were often sub divided into Districts and from 1862, Subdistricts. Much information on Civil War departments can be found in Eicher &amp; Eicher, &quot;Civil War High Commands&quot;.

<text>A trade route is a logistical network identified as a series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term can also be used to refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long-distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. During the Middle Ages, organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade became increasingly prominent.

In modern times, commercial activity shifted from the major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation-states. This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free-trade agreements, which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions. Innovative transportation of modern times includes pipeline transport and the relatively well-known trade involving rail routes, automobiles, and cargo airlines.

==History==

===Development of early routes===

====Early development====
Long-distance trade routes were developed in the Chalcolithic period. The period from the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE to the beginning of the Common Era saw societies in Southeast Asia, Western Asia, the Mediterranean, China, and the Indian subcontinent develop major transportation networks for trade.

One of the vital instruments which facilitated long-distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden. Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE, could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way. The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads to control the long-distance trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the Arabian Peninsula. Caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods, the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators. With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes – dispensing innovations of civilizations – began to rise.

====Maritime trade====


Navigation was known in Sumer between the 4th and the 3rd millennium BCE. The Egyptians had trade routes through the Red Sea, importing spices from the &quot;Land of Punt&quot; (East Africa) and from Arabia.

In Asia, the earliest evidence of maritime trade was the Neolithic trade networks of the Austronesian peoples among which is the &quot;lingling-o&quot; jade industry of the Philippines, Taiwan, southern Vietnam and peninsular Thailand. It also included the long-distance routes of Austronesian traders from Indonesia and Malaysia connecting China with South Asia and the Middle East since approximately 500 BCE. It facilitated the spread of Southeast Asian spices and Chinese goods to the west, as well as the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism to the east. This route would later become known as the Maritime Silk Road, although that is a misnomer, since spices, rather than silk, were traded along this route. Many Austronesian technologies like the outrigger and catamaran, as well as Austronesian ship terminologies, still persist in many of the coastal cultures in the Indian Ocean.

Maritime trade began with safer coastal trade and evolved with the manipulation of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes. By making use of the maritime trade routes, bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.

====Visible trade routes====

The peninsula of Anatolia lay on the commercial land routes to Europe from Asia as well as the sea route from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. Records from the 19th century BCE attest to the existence of an Assyrian merchant colony at Kanesh in Cappadocia (now in modern Turkey). Trading networks of the Old World included the Grand Trunk Road of India and the Incense Road of Arabia. A transportation network consisting of hard-surfaced highways, using concrete made from volcanic ash and lime, was built by the Romans as early as 312 BCE, during the times of the Censor Appius Claudius Caecus. Parts of the Mediterranean world, Roman Britain, Tigris-Euphrates river system and North Africa fell under the reach of this network at some point of their history.

According to Robert Allen Denemark (2000):
&quot;The spread of urban trading networks, and their extension along the Persian Gulf and eastern Mediterranean, created a complex molecular structure of regional foci so that as well as the zonation of core and periphery (originally created around Mesopotamia) there was a series of interacting civilizations: Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley; then also Syria, central Anatolia (Hittites) and the Aegean (Minoans and Mycenaeans). Beyond this was a margin which included not only temperate areas such as Europe, but the dry steppe corridor of central Asia. This was truly a world system, even though it occupied only a restricted portion of the western Old World. Whilst each civilization emphasized its ideological autonomy, all were identifiably part of a common world of interacting components.&quot;
These routes – spreading religion, trade and technology – have historically been vital to the growth of urban civilization. The extent of development of cities, and the level of their integration into a larger world system, has often been attributed to their position in various active transport networks.

===Historic trade routes===

====Combined land and waterway routes====

=====Incense Route=====

The Incense Route served as a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods. The incense trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE. This trade was crucial to the economy of Yemen and the frankincense and myrrh trees were seen as a source of wealth by its rulers.

Ptolemy II Philadelphus, emperor of Ptolemaic Egypt, may have forged an alliance with the Lihyanites in order to secure the incense route at Dedan, thereby rerouting the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt. I. E. S. Edwards connects the Syro-Ephraimite War to the desire of the Israelites and the Aramaeans to control the northern end of the Incense route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding Transjordan.

Gerrha – inhabited by Chaldean exiles from Babylon – controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised control over the trading of aromatics to Babylon in the 1st century BCE. The Nabateans exercised control over the routes along the Incense Route, and their hold was challenged – without success – by Antigonus Cyclops, emperor of Syria. The Nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions.

The replacement of Greece by the Roman empire as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the East and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of the south. According to Milo Kearney (2003) &quot;The South Arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the Roman ships in the Gulf of Aden. In response, the Romans destroyed Aden and favored the Western Abyssinian coast of the Red Sea.&quot; Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a single power.

=====Pre-Columbian trade=====
Some similarities between the Mesoamerican and the Andean cultures suggest that the two regions became a part of a wider world system, as a result of trade, by the 1st millennium BCE. The current academic view is that the flow of goods across the Andean slopes was controlled by institutions distributing locations to local groups, who were then free to access them for trading. This trade across the Andean slopes – described sometimes as &quot;vertical trade&quot; – may have overshadowed the long-distance trade between the people of the Andes and the neighboring forests. The Callawaya herbalists traded in tropical plants between 6th and the 10th centuries, while copper was dealt by specialized merchants in the Peruvian valley of Chincha. Long-distance trade may have seen local elites resorting to struggle in order for manipulation and control.

Prior to the Inca dominance, specialized long-distance merchants provided the highlanders with goods such as gold nuggets, copper hatchets, cocoa, salt etc. for redistribution among the locals, and were key players in the politics of the region. Hatchet shaped copper currency was produced by the Peruvian people, in order to obtain valuables from pre Columbian Ecuador. A maritime exchange system stretched from the west coast of Mexico to southernmost Peru, trading mostly in Spondylus, which represented rain and fertility and was considered the principal food of the gods by the people of the Inca empire. Spondylus was used in elite rituals, and the effective redistribution of it had political effect in the Andes during the pre-Hispanic times.

====Predominantly overland routes====

=====Silk Road=====
The Silk Road was one of the first trade routes to join the Eastern and the Western worlds. According to Vadime Elisseeff (2000):
&quot;Along the Silk Roads, technology traveled, ideas were exchanged, and friendship and understanding between East and West were experienced for the first time on a large scale. Easterners were exposed to Western ideas and life-styles, and Westerners, too, learned about Eastern culture and its spirituality-oriented cosmology. Buddhism as an Eastern religion received international attention through the Silk Roads.&quot;
Cultural interactions patronized often by powerful emperors, such as Kanishka, led to development of art due to introduction of a rich variety of influences. Buddhist missions thrived along the Silk Roads, partly due to the conducive intermixing of trade and cultural values, which created a series of safe stoppages for both the pilgrims and the traders. The Silk Roads led to the creation of a merchant class urban centers and the growth of trade-based economies. Among the frequented routes of the Silk Route was the Burmese route extending from Bhamo, which served as a path for Marco Polo&#x27;s visit to Yunnan and Indian Buddhist missions to Canton in order to establish Buddhist monasteries. This route – often under the presence of hostile tribes – also finds mention in the works of Rashid-al-Din Hamadani.

=====Grand Trunk Road=====
The Grand Trunk Road – connecting Chittagong in Bangladesh to Peshawar in Pakistan – has existed for over two and a half millennia. One of the important trade routes of the world, this road has been a strategic artery with fortresses, halting posts, wells, post offices, milestones and other facilities. Part of this road through Pakistan also coincided with the Silk Road.

This highway has been associated with emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Sher Shah Suri, the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the travelers and the upkeep of the road. Emperor Sher Shah widened and realigned the road to other routes, and provided approximately 1700 roadside inns through his empire. These inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status.

The British occupation of this road was of special significance for the British Raj in India. Bridges, pathways and newer inns were constructed by the British for the first thirty-seven years of their reign since the occupation of Punjab in 1849. The British followed roughly the same alignment as the old routes, and at some places the newer routes ran parallel to the older routes.

Vadime Elisseeff (2000) comments on the Grand Trunk Road:

&quot;Along this road marched not only the mighty armies of conquerors, but also the caravans of traders, scholars, artists, and common folk. Together with people, moved ideas, languages, customs, and cultures, not just in one, but in both directions. At different meeting places – permanent as well as temporary – people of different origins and from different cultural backgrounds, professing different faiths and creeds, eating different foods, wearing different clothes, and speaking different languages and dialects would meet one another peacefully. They would understand one another&#x27;s food, dress, manner, and etiquette, and even borrow words, phrases, idioms and, at times, whole languages from others.&quot;
=====Amber Road=====

The Amber Road was a European trade route associated with the trade and transport of amber. Amber satisfied the criteria for long-distance trade as it was light in weight and was in high demand for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean. Before the establishment of Roman control over areas such as Pannonia, the Amber Road was virtually the only route available for long-distance trade.

Towns along the Amber Road began to rise steadily during the 1st century CE, despite the troop movements under Titus Flavius Vespasianus and his son Titus Flavius Domitianus.
Under the reign of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, the Amber Road was straightened and paved according to the prevailing urban standards. Roman towns began to appear along the road, initially founded near the site of Celtic &quot;oppida&quot;.

The 3rd century saw the Danube river become the principal artery of trade, eclipsing the Amber Road and other commercial routes. The redirection of investment to the Danubian forts saw the towns along the Amber Road growing slowly, though yet retaining their prosperity. The prolonged struggle between the Romans and the barbarians further left its mark on the towns along the Amber Road.

=====Via Maris=====
Via Maris, literally Latin for &quot;the way of the sea&quot;, was an ancient highway used by the Romans and the Crusaders. The states controlling the Via Maris were in a position to grant access for trade to their own citizens and collect tolls from the outsiders to maintain the trade route. The name &quot;Via Maris&quot; is a Latin translation of a Hebrew phrase related to Isaiah. Due to the biblical significance of this ancient route, many attempts to find its present-day location have been made by Christian pilgrims. 13th-century traveler and pilgrim Burchard of Mount Zion refers to the Via Maris route as a way leading along the shore of the Sea of Galilee.

=====Trans Saharan trade=====
Early Muslim writings confirm that the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū &#x27;Ubayd &#x27;Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the mainstay of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.

The powerful Saharan tribes, Berber in origin and later adapting to Muslim and Arab cultures, controlled the channels to western Africa by making efficient use of horse-drawn vehicles and pack animals. The Songhai engaged in a struggle against the Sa&#x27;di dynasty of Morocco over the control of the trans Saharan trade, resulting in damage on both sides and a weak Moroccan victory, further strengthening the uninvolved Saharan tribes. Struggles and disturbances continued till the 14th century, by which the Mandé merchants were trading with the Hausa, between Lake Chad and the Niger. Newer trade routes developed following extension of trade.

====Predominantly maritime routes====
=====Austronesian maritime trade network=====
Long-distance maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean also had run by the Austronesian peoples of Island Southeast Asia. They established trade routes with Southern India and Sri Lanka as early as 1500 BCE, ushering an exchange of material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, sewn-plank boats, and paan) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, bananas, sugarcane, cloves, and nutmeg); as well as connecting the material cultures of India and China.. They constituted the majority of the Indian Ocean component of the spice trade network. Indonesians, in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamaran and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the Westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by the first half of the first millennium AD. It continued up to historic times, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road. This trade network also included smaller trade routes within Island Southeast Asia, including the lingling-o jade network, and the trepanging network.

In eastern Austronesia, various traditional maritime trade networks also existed. Among them was the ancient Lapita trade network of Island Melanesia; the Hiri trade cycle, Sepik Coast exchange, and the Kula ring of Papua New Guinea; the ancient trading voyages in Micronesia between the Mariana Islands and the Caroline Islands (and possibly also New Guinea and the Philippines); and the vast inter-island trade networks of Polynesia.

=====Roman-India routes=====
The Ptolemaic dynasty (305 to 30 BC) had initiated Greco-Roman maritime trade contact with India using the Red Sea ports. The Roman historian Strabo mentions a vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt, indicating that monsoon was known and manipulated for trade in his time. By the time of Augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India, trading in a diverse variety of goods. Arsinoe, Berenice Troglodytica and Myos Hormos were the principal Roman ports involved in this maritime trading network, while the Indian ports included Barbaricum, Barygaza, Muziris and Arikamedu.

The Indians were present in Alexandria and the Christian and Jewish settlers from Rome continued to live in India long after the fall of the Roman empire, which resulted in Rome&#x27;s loss of the Red Sea ports, previously used to secure trade with India by the Greco-Roman world since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

=====Hanseatic trade=====
Shortly before the 12th century the Germans played a relatively modest role in the north European trade. However, this was to change with the development of Hanseatic trade, as a result of which German traders became prominent in the Baltic and the North Sea regions. Following the death of Eric VI of Denmark, German forces attacked and sacked Denmark, bringing with them artisans and merchants under the new administration which controlled the Hansa regions. During the third quarter of the 14th century the Hanseatic trade faced two major difficulties: economic conflict with the Flanders and hostilities with Denmark. These events led to the formation of an organized association of Hanseatic towns, which replaced the earlier union of German merchants. This new Hansa of the towns, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade, was prominent for the next hundred and fifty years.

Philippe Dollinger associates the downfall of the Hansa to a new alliance between Lübeck, Hamburg and Bremen, which outshadowed the older institution. He further sets the date of dissolution of the Hansa at 1630 and concludes that the Hansa was almost entirely forgotten by the end of the 18th century. Scholar Georg Friedrich Sartorius published the first monograph regarding the community in the early years of the 19th century.

=====From the Varangians to the Greek=====
The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks (, &quot;Put&#x27; iz varyag v greki&quot;, , , &quot;Emporikḗ Odós Varángōn-Ellḗnōn&quot;) was a trade route that connected Scandinavia, Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Byzantine Empire. The route allowed traders along the route to establish a direct prosperous trade with Byzantium, and prompted some of them to settle in the territories of present-day Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.

The route began in Scandinavian trading centres such as Birka, Hedeby, and Gotland, crossed the Baltic Sea entered the Gulf of Finland, followed the Neva River into the Lake Ladoga. Then it followed the Volkhov River, upstream past the towns of Staraya Ladoga and Velikiy Novgorod, crossed Lake Ilmen, and up the Lovat River. From there, ships had to be portaged to the Dnieper River near Gnezdovo. A second route from the Baltic to the Dnieper was along the Western Dvina (Daugava) between the Lovat and the Dnieper in the Smolensk region, and along the Kasplya River to Gnezdovo. Along the Dnieper, the route crossed several major rapids and passed through Kiev, and after entering the Black Sea followed its west coast to Constantinople.

=====Maritime republics&#x27; Mediterranean trade=====

The economic growth of Europe around the year 1000, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, eased the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean. The growing independence of some coastal cities gave them a leading role in this commerce: Maritime Republics, Italian &quot;Repubbliche Marinare&quot; (Venice, Genoa, Amalfi, Pisa, Gaeta, Ancona and Ragusa), developed their own &quot;empires&quot; in the Mediterranean shores.

From the 8th until the 15th century, Venetian and genoese merchants held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East. The silk and spice trade, involving spices, incense, herbs, drugs and opium, made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages. They were all imported from Asia and Africa. Muslim traders – mainly descendants of Arab sailors from Yemen and Oman – controlled maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, westward to Ormus in Persian Gulf and Jeddah in the Red Sea. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed then the goods through Europe until the rise of the Ottoman Empire, that eventually led to the fall of Constantinople in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.

=====Spice Route=====
As trade between India and the Greco-Roman world increased spices became the main import from India to the Western world, bypassing silk and other commodities. The Indian commercial connection with South East Asia proved vital to the merchants of Arabia and Persia during the 7th and 8th centuries.

The Abbasids used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to India and China. Merchants arriving from India in the port city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk, camphor, ambergris and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad, the sultan of Yemen. Moluccan products shipped across the ports of Arabia to the Near East passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka. Indian exports of spices find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850 CE), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century). After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports, spices were sometimes shipped to East Africa, where they were used for many purposes, including burial rites.

On the orders of Manuel I of Portugal, four vessels under the command of navigator Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, continuing to the eastern coast of Africa to Malindi to sail across the Indian Ocean to Calicut. The wealth of the Indies was now open for the Europeans to explore; the Portuguese Empire was one of the early European empires to grow from spice trade.

=====Maritime Jade Road=====
The Maritime Jade Road was an extensive trading network connecting multiple areas in Southeast and East Asia. Its primary products were made of jade mined from Taiwan by animist Taiwanese indigenous peoples and processed mostly in the Philippines by animist indigenous Filipinos, especially in Batanes, Luzon, and Palawan. Some were also processed in Vietnam, while the peoples of Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia also participated in the massive animist-led trading network. Participants in the network at the time had a majority animist population. The maritime road is one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world. It was in existence for at least 3,000 years, where its peak production was from 2000 BCE to 500 CE, older than the Silk Road in mainland Eurasia or the later Maritime Silk Road. A notable artifact that the trading network made, the Lingling-o artifacts, were made by artisans around 500 BCE. The network began to wane during its final centuries from 500 CE until 1000 CE. The entire period of the network was a golden age for the diverse animist societies of the region.

=====Maritime Silk Road=====
The Maritime Silk Road refers to the maritime section of historic Silk Road that connects China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Arabian Peninsula, Somalia and all the way to Egypt and finally Europe. It flourished between 2nd-century BCE and 15th-century CE. Despite its association with China in recent centuries, the Maritime Silk Road was primarily established and operated by Austronesian sailors in Southeast Asia, and by Persian and Arab traders in the Arabian Sea.

The Maritime Silk Road developed from the earlier Austronesian spice trade networks of Islander Southeast Asians with Sri Lanka and Southern India (established 1000 to 600 BCE), as well as the earlier Maritime Jade Road, known for &quot;lingling-o&quot; artifacts, in Southeast Asia, based in Taiwan and the Philippines. For most of its history, Austronesian thalassocracies controlled the flow of the Maritime Silk Road, especially the polities around the straits of Malacca and Bangka, the Malay Peninsula, and the Mekong Delta; although Chinese records misidentified these kingdoms as being &quot;Indian&quot; due to the Indianization of these regions. Prior to the 10th century, the route was primarily used by Southeast Asian traders, although Tamil and Persian traders also sailed them. The route was influential in the early spread of Hinduism and Buddhism to the east.

China later built its own fleets starting from the Song dynasty in the 10th century, participating directly in the trade route up until the end of the Colonial Era and the collapse of the Qing dynasty.

===Modern routes===

The modern times saw development of newer means of transport and often controversial free trade agreements, which altered the political and logistical approach prevalent during the Middle Ages. Newer means of transport led to the establishment of new routes, and countries opened up borders to allow trade in mutually agreed goods as per the prevailing free trade agreement. Some old trading route were reopened during the modern times, although in different political and logistical scenarios. The entry of harmful foreign pollutants by the way of trade routes has been a cause of alarm during the modern times. A conservative estimate stresses that future damages from harmful animal and plant diseases may be as high as 134 billion US dollars in the absence of effective measures to prevent the introduction of unwanted pests through various trade routes.

====Wagonway routes====

Networks, like the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon Trail, became prominent in the United States with wagon trains gaining popularity as a mode of long-distance overland transportation for both people and goods. The Oregon–California routes were highly organized with planned rendezvous locations and essential supplies. The settlers in the United States used these wagon trains – sometimes made up of 100 of more Conestoga wagons – for westward emigration during the 18th and the 19th centuries. Among the challenges faced by the wagon route operators were crossing rivers, mountains and hostile Native Americans. Preparations were also made according to the weather and protection of trade and travelers was ensured by a few guards on horseback.
Wagon freighting was also essential to American growth until it was replaced by the railroad and the truck.

====Railway routes====
The 1844 Railway act of England compelled at least one train to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a penny a mile. Trade benefited as the workers and the lower classes had the ability to travel to other towns frequently. Suburban communities began to develop and towns began to spread outwards. The British constructed a vast railway network in India, but it was considered to serve a strategic purpose in addition to the commercial purpose. The efficient use of rail routes helped in the unification of the United States of America, and the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869.

The modern times saw nations struggle for the control of rail routes: The Trans-Siberian Railway was intended to be used by the Russian government for control of Manchuria and later China; the German forces wanted to establish Berlin-Baghdad Railway in order to influence the Near East; and the Austrian government planned a route from Vienna to Salonika for control of the Balkans.
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (2002):
Railroads reached their maturity in the early 20th century, as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in the industrialized countries of the world. By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.

Although railroads have lost much of the general-freight-carrying business to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.
====Modern road networks====
The advent of motor vehicles created a demand for better use of highways. Roads evolved into two way roads, expressways, freeways and tollways during the modern times. Existing roads were developed and highways were designed according to intended use.

Trucks came into widespread use in the Western World during World War I, and quickly gained reputation as a means of long-distance transportation of goods. Modern highways, such as the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 1 (Australia) and Pan-American Highway allowed transport of goods and services across great distances. Automobiles continue to play a crucial role in the economies of the Industrialized countries, resulting in rise of businesses such as motor freight operation and truck transportation.

The emission rate for cars using highways has been on a decline between 1975 and 1995 due to regulations and the introduction of unleaded petrol. This trend is especially notable since there has been a growth in vehicles and vehicle miles traveled by automobiles using these highways.

====Modern maritime routes====

A consistent shift from land based trade to sea-based trade has been recorded since the last three millennia. The strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many: they are both less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages. Oceanic ports can help forge trading relationships with other parts of the world easily.

Modern maritime trade routes – sometimes in the form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal played an important role in the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.

Waterway commerce was historically important to Europe, particularly to Russia. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (2002): &quot;Russia has been a significant beneficiary. Not only have inland waterways opened vast areas of its interior to development, but Moscow – linked to the White, Baltic, Black, Caspian, and Azov seas by canals and rivers – has become a major inland port.&quot;

Oil spills are recorded both in case of maritime routes and pipeline routes to the main refineries. Oil spills, amounting to as much as 7.56 billion liters of oil entering the oceans every year, occur due to damaged equipment or human error.

The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is a current project of the Chinese government to expand and intensify trade on the maritime Silk Road. This is leading to major investments in ports, traffic routes and other infrastructure in Europe and Africa as well. The maritime silk road essentially runs from the Chinese coast to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, via the Sri Lankan Colombo towards the southern tip of India, to the East African Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its international free port and its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe and the North Sea.

====Free trade areas====

Historically, many governments followed a policy of protection of trade. International free trade became visible in 1860 with the Anglo-French commercial treaty, and the trend gained further momentum during the period after World War II.
According to The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition:
&quot;After World War II, strong sentiment developed throughout the world against protection and high tariffs and in favor of freer trade. The results were new organizations and agreements on international trade such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1948), the Benelux Economic Union (1948), the European Economic Community (Common Market, 1957), the European Free Trade Association (1959), Mercosur (the Southern Cone Common Market, 1991), and the World Trade Organization (1995). In 1993, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was approved by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In the early 1990s, the nations of the European Union (the successor organization to the Common Market) undertook to remove all barriers to the free movement of trade and employment across their mutual borders.&quot;
In May 2004 the United States of America signed the American Free trade Agreement with five Central American nations.

====Air routes====
Air transport has become an indispensable part of modern society. People have come to use air transport both for long and middle distances, with the average route length of long distances being 720 kilometers in Europe and 1220 kilometers in the US. This industry annually carries 1.6 billion passengers worldwide, covers a 15 million kilometer network, and has an annual turnover of 260 billion dollars.

This mode of transportation links national, international and global economies, making it vital to many other industries. Newer trends of liberalization of trade have fostered routes among nations bound by agreements. One such example, the American Open Skies policy, led to greater openness in many international markets, but some international restrictions have survived even during the present times.

Express delivery through international cargo airlines touched US$20 billion in 1998 and, according to the World Trade Organization, is expected to triple in 2015. In 1998, 50 pure cargo-service companies operated internationally.

Air transport particularly favors light, expensive and small products: electronic media rather than books, for example, and refined drugs rather than bulk food.

====Pipeline networks====
The economic importance of pipeline transport – responsible for a high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often unrecognized by the general public due to the lack of visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states – in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey – through pipeline networks.

In some select cases, pipelines can even transport solids, such as coal and other minerals, over long distances; short-distance transportation of goods such as grain, cement, concrete, solid wastes, pulp etc. is also feasible.

<text>An eye rhyme, also called a visual rhyme or a sight rhyme, is a rhyme in which two words are spelled similarly but pronounced differently. 

Many older English poems, particularly those written in Early Modern and Middle English, contain rhymes that were originally true or full rhymes, but as read by modern readers, they are now eye rhymes because of shifts in pronunciation, especially the Great Vowel Shift. These are called historic rhymes. Historic rhymes are used by linguists to reconstruct pronunciations of old languages, and are used particularly extensively in the reconstruction of Old Chinese, whose writing system does not allude directly to pronunciation.

==Historic rhymes==
One example of a historic rhyme (i.e., one that was a true rhyme but is now an eye rhyme) is the following:

When &quot;Hamlet&quot; was written , &quot;flies&quot; and &quot;enemies&quot; rhymed in local dialects, but as a result of the shifts in pronunciation since then, the original rhyme has been lost.

Another example of a historic rhyme is the following:

When the poem was published in 1712, the word &quot;tea&quot; (which is only attested in English from about 60 years before) was often pronounced &quot;tay&quot;, as it still is in certain dialects; the pronunciation &quot;tee&quot; predominated from the mid-18th century.

===Conventional historic rhymes===

Historic rhymes that were lost phonetically in the Great Vowel Shift were sometimes retained as conventional rhymes. For example, in 1940, W. H. Auden wrote:

This represents the same historic rhyme as &quot;flies&quot; and &quot;enemies&quot; above, even though by the 20th century &quot;lie&quot; and &quot;poetry&quot; had long since ceased to rhyme. (When Auden himself read the poem aloud, he pronounced &quot;lie&quot; and &quot;poetry&quot; in the usual, non-rhyming 20th-century fashion.)

Similarly, although the noun &quot;wind&quot; shifted to its modern pronunciation during the 1700s, it remained a convention to rhyme it as though it were pronounced &quot;wined&quot;, so that in 1896, Ernest Dowson wrote:

<text>The Drowned and the Saved () is a book of essays by Italian-Jewish author and Holocaust survivor Primo Levi on life and death in the Nazi extermination camps, drawing on his personal experience as a survivor of Auschwitz (Monowitz).
The author&#x27;s last work, written in 1986, a year before his death, &quot;The Drowned and the Saved&quot; is an attempt at an analytical approach, in contrast to his earlier books &quot;If This Is a Man&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Truce&quot; (1963), which are autobiographical.

<text>James Lee Keltner (born April 27, 1942) is an American drummer and percussionist known primarily for his session work. He was characterized by Bob Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as &quot;the leading session drummer in America&quot;.

==Career==
Keltner was inspired to start playing because of an interest in jazz, but the popularity of jazz was declining during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and it was the explosion of pop/rock in the mid-1960s that enabled him to break into recording work in Los Angeles. His first gig as a session musician was recording &quot;She&#x27;s Just My Style&quot; for the pop group Gary Lewis and the Playboys.

Keltner&#x27;s music career was hardly paying a living, and for several years at the outset he was supported by his wife. Toward the end of the 1960s, he finally began getting regular session work and eventually became one of the busiest drummers in Los Angeles. His earliest credited performances on record were with Gabor Szabo on the 1968 album &quot;Bacchanal&quot;.

In 1968, Keltner was also working in a music shop in Pasadena just down the street from the old Ice House coffeehouse when he was recruited to play drums in a &quot;psychedelic&quot; vocal group named &quot;MC Squared&quot; along with Michael Crowley, Michael Clough, Linda Carey—all from the folk group The Back Porch Majority)—and session guitarist/bassist Randy Cierley Sterling. They were signed by Mo Ostin and recorded an album for Warner/Reprise originally titled &quot;MC Squared&quot; which has later been re-mastered and re-released in 2012 with the album title &quot;Tantalizing Colors.&quot; They appeared live that same year on the Hugh Hefner / &quot;Playboy&quot; Magazine television show &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot;, playing two songs: an original by MC Squared members Michael Clough and Michael Crowley titled &quot;I Know You&quot; and a version of the Fred Neil song Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;. Both Playboy After Dark performances with Keltner playing drums can currently be viewed on YouTube.

It was his work with Leon Russell playing on Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s &quot;Accept No Substitute&quot; that attracted the attention of Joe Cocker, who recruited Russell and everyone else he could out of the Delaney &amp; Bonnie band for his &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; tour. Playing with Joe Cocker led to work in 1970 and 1971, on records by Carly Simon (&quot;No Secrets&quot;), Barbra Streisand (&quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot;), Booker T. Jones (&quot;Booker T. &amp; Priscilla&quot;), George Harrison (&quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;) and John Lennon (&quot;Imagine&quot;).

===Former Beatles===
Keltner is known for his session work on solo recordings by three members of the Beatles, working with George Harrison, John Lennon (including Lennon solo albums, as well as albums released both by the Plastic Ono Band and Yoko Ono), and Ringo Starr.

Keltner played on many former Beatle solo releases, including Harrison&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; and Lennon&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;. When Ringo Starr recorded his first full-fledged pop album, &quot;Ringo&quot;, Keltner was featured on five tracks. Following this, Keltner joined George Harrison on his 1974 tour of the United States.

In 1974, Keltner played on the Lennon-produced Harry Nilsson album &quot;Pussy Cats&quot; alongside Ringo (and Keith Moon) on &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. Keltner was featured on the Nilsson albums &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot; with Harrison, Starr and Beatles associate Klaus Voormann as well as &quot;Duit on Mon Dei&quot; with Starr and Voormann.

Keltner&#x27;s relationship with the former Beatles was such that, in 1973, his name was used to mock Paul McCartney on albums released by Harrison and Starr. Early that year, McCartney, the only Beatle not to have worked with Keltner, included a note on the back cover of his &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; album, encouraging fans to join the &quot;Wings Fun Club&quot; by sending a &quot;stamped addressed envelope&quot; to an address in London. Later that year, both Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; and Starr&#x27;s &quot;Ringo&quot; contained a similar note encouraging fans to join the &quot;Jim Keltner Fan Club&quot; by sending a &quot;stamped undressed elephant&quot; to an address in Hollywood. Keltner performed with George Harrison throughout his solo career. He even worked on Harrison&#x27;s final posthumous album Brainwashed.

Keltner played the role of the judge in the music video for George Harrison&#x27;s 1976 Top 30 hit, &quot;This Song&quot;. 

In 1989, Keltner toured with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band.

===Equipment===
Keltner is an endorser of DW drums, hardware and pedals, Ahead drumsticks/gloves/griptape, Paiste Cymbals, Remo drumheads and world percussion and Roland electronics.

===Little Village===
In 1987, Keltner, along with guitarist Ry Cooder and bassist Nick Lowe, played on John Hiatt&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Family&quot;. Four years later the four musicians reunited as the band Little Village, recording an eponymous album.

===Traveling Wilburys===
Keltner played drums on both albums released by the 1980s supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, playing under the pseudonym &quot;Buster Sidebury&quot;.

===Ry Cooder===
Keltner became Ry Cooder&#x27;s go-to drummer, recording with him on many of his albums for over 40 years, including the following, as well as playing with him in Little Village.
*&quot;Boomer&#x27;s Story&quot; (1972)
*&quot;Paradise and Lunch&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Chicken Skin Music&quot; (1976)
*&quot;Bop till You Drop&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Borderline&quot; (1980)
*&quot;The Slide Area&quot; (1982)
*&quot;Get Rhythm&quot; (1987)
*&quot;Chávez Ravine&quot; (2005)
*&quot;My Name Is Buddy&quot; (2007)
*&quot;I, Flathead&quot; (2008)

He is featured on Carly Simon&#x27;s 1971 album, &quot;Anticipation&quot;.

He played on various tracks on Randy Newman&#x27;s albums &quot;Sail Away&quot; and &quot;Little Criminals&quot;, including &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot;, &quot;Short People&quot;, and &quot;Jolly Coppers On Parade&quot;.

In 1974, he played on most tracks on the Jack Bruce album &quot;Out of the Storm&quot;.

Other demonstrations of his style and range can be found in &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; from John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Watching the River Flow&quot; by Bob Dylan, and the hit single &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; by Gary Wright.

<doc id="583165" wikidata="Q5421890" url="?curid=583165" title="Extended metaphor">
<text>An extended metaphor, also known as a conceit or sustained metaphor, is the use of a single metaphor or analogy at length in a work of literature. It differs from a mere metaphor in its length, and in having more than one single point of contact between the object described (the so-called tenor) and the comparison used to describe it (the vehicle). These implications are repeatedly emphasized, discovered, rediscovered, and progressed in new ways.

== History of meaning==
In the Renaissance, the term &quot;conceit&quot; (which is related to the word concept) indicated the idea that informed a literary work—its theme. Later, it came to stand for the extended and heightened metaphor common in Renaissance poetry, and later still it came to denote the even more elaborate metaphors of 17th century poetry. 

The Renaissance conceit, given its importance in Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Il Canzoniere&quot;, is also referred to as Petrarchan conceit. It is a comparison in which human experiences are described in terms of an outsized metaphor (a kind of metaphorical hyperbole)—as in Petrarch&#x27;s comparison between the effect of the gaze of the beloved and the sun melting snow. The history of poetry often features contemporary poets referencing the verses of their predecessors, like Shakespeare building on Petrarchan imagery in his Sonnet 130: &quot;My mistress&#x27; eyes are nothing like the sun&quot;.

The 17th-century and the sometimes so-called metaphysical poets extended the notion of the elaborate metaphor; their idea of conceit differs from an extended analogy in the sense that it does not have a clear-cut relationship between the things being compared. Helen Gardner, in her study of the metaphysical poets, observed that &quot;a conceit is a comparison whose ingenuity is more striking than its justness&quot; and that &quot;a comparison becomes a conceit when we are made to concede likeness while being strongly conscious of unlikeness.&quot;

==Petrarchan==
The Petrarchan conceit is a form of love poetry wherein a man&#x27;s love interest is referred to in hyperbole. For instance, the lover is a ship on a stormy sea, and his mistress is either &quot;a cloud of dark disdain&quot; or the sun.

The paradoxical pain and pleasure of lovesickness is often described using oxymoron, for instance uniting peace and war, burning and freezing, and so forth. But images which were novel in the sonnets of Petrarch, in his innovative exploration of human feelings, became clichés in the poetry of later imitators. Romeo uses hackneyed Petrarchan conceits when describing his love for Rosaline as &quot;bright smoke, cold fire, sick health&quot;.

===William Shakespeare===

In Sonnet 18 the speaker offers an extended metaphor which compares his love to Summer. Shakespeare also makes use of extended metaphors in Romeo and Juliet, most notably in the balcony scene where Romeo offers an extended metaphor comparing Juliet to the sun.

:It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
:Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
:Who is already sick and pale with grief,
:That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
:Be not her maid, since she is envious;
:Her vestal livery is but sick and green
:And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.

==Metaphysical conceit==
The metaphysical conceit is often imaginative, exploring specific parts of an experience. A frequently cited example is found in John Donne&#x27;s &quot;A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning&quot;, in which a couple faced with absence from each other is likened to the legs of a compass. In comparison with the earlier conceit, the metaphysical conceit has a startling, unusual quality: Robert H. Ray described it as a &quot;lengthy, far-fetched, ingenious analogy&quot;. The analogy is developed throughout multiple lines, sometimes the entire poem. Poet and critic Samuel Johnson was not enamored with this conceit, critiquing its use of &quot;dissimilar images&quot; and the &quot;discovery of occult resemblances in things apparently unlike&quot;. His judgment, that the conceit was a device in which &quot;the most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together&quot;, is often cited and held sway until the early twentieth century, when poets like T. S. Eliot re-evaluated the English poetry of the seventeenth century. Well-known poets employing this type of conceit include John Donne, Andrew Marvell, and George Herbert.

==Later examples==

===T. S. Eliot===

In the following passage from &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, T. S. Eliot provides an example of an extended metaphor:

:The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, 
:The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes 
:Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, 
:Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, 
:Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
:Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
:And seeing that it was a soft October night, 
:Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

Qualities (grounds) that we associate with cats (vehicle), color, rubbing, muzzling, licking, slipping, leaping, curling, sleeping, are used to describe the fog (tenor).

=== James Joyce ===
Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; features an extended metaphor between its characters and those of the Ancient Greek epic, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. Leopold Bloom maps to Odysseus, Stephen Dedalus maps to Telemachus, and Molly Bloom maps to Penelope; minor characters also demonstrate parallels, such as the one-eyed &quot;Cyclops&quot; character which Bloom interacts with. Used as a hypotext, many readers at the time of publication did not necessarily notice the connection, until it was pointed out by T.S. Eliot’s essay on the subject.

<text>Centenary House was a five-storey building in Canberra, Australia, and was located at 19 National Circuit, Barton.

It was the national headquarters of the Australian National Audit Office (usually known as the ANAO, a Commonwealth Government entity). The building was owned until July 2005 by John Curtin House Limited, an entity wholly owned by the ALP. The leasing of part of Centenary House to the ANAO was the subject of political controversy for more than ten years.

Centenary House was built in 1991 and the ALP (through Lend Lease, a property company) negotiated a lease with the ANAO. This lease began on 23 September 1993, for 15 years (that is, it is to conclude on 23 September 2008).

The total area that was leased was 6,297 square metres. In 1993, the rent to be charged was $367.95 per square metre. Due to a &quot;ratchet clause&quot;, which specifies that the annual rent would increase by 9% or market rates (whichever is the greater), in 2004 the annual rent is $949.47. The current estimated market price in Canberra for rented space is $330.00.

The Federal Opposition (the Liberal-National Coalition at that time) demanded an enquiry to what they saw as a &quot;&quot; and the Keating ALP Government set up a Royal Commission.

The Royal Commission (headed by Trevor Morling QC) found that the rent charged &quot;was a fair market rental for accommodation in a building such as Centenary House. This was supported by extensive market evidence and there is nothing to suggest that it was excessive&quot;. The ratchet clause was also found as justified because it was &quot;well supported by historical rent movements&quot; and that &quot;the length of the term is not disadvantageous to the Commonwealth&quot;.

A second Royal Commission was appointed by the Howard government, and during 2004 Howard government ministers, particularly Tony Abbott, repeatedly accused the ALP of improperly profiting from the alleged &quot;rort&quot; of the lease. The Royal Commission reported in December 2004.

The report of the Royal Commissioner, Hon David Hunt, AO QC, found that the original inquiry was inadequate. It found that the rent was excessive and should not have been entered into by a prudent government. The report was critical of several public servants, but did not make any findings of corrupt conduct by John Curtin House Limited or the Australian Labor Party.

In July 2005, the ALP National Secretary, Tim Gartrell, announced that the building had been sold for more than $30 million.

In November 2021 Centenary House was demolished. It is to be replaced with a six-storey office building.

<text>George Hall (November 19, 1916 – October 21, 2002) was a Canadian theatre, television, and film actor. He had an over 50-year career as a Broadway character actor, making his Broadway debut in 1946 and working steadily in New York theatrical productions for decades thereafter. Outside of the theatre, he is probably best remembered for his role as the 93-year-old Indiana Jones in the TV series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; (1992). He also played Ernie Tuttle #2 and John the butler on the television soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and the addled but kind-hearted Mr. Eldridge in the AMC series &quot;Remember WENN&quot;, which aired in the mid-1990s.

He was married to Cordelia Ware, also an actor on Broadway, until her death in 1969.

== Death ==
Hall, a working actor at 85, died on October 21, 2002, of complications from a stroke. He had just finished a run on Broadway playing the role of The Sorcerer in &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;, which had concluded its run the previous day (October 20th).

<text>Jean Chacornac (21 June 1823 – 23 September 1873) was a French astronomer and discoverer of a comet and several asteroids.

He was born in Lyon and died in Saint-Jean-en-Royans, southeastern France. Working in Marseille and Paris, he discovered six asteroids in the asteroid belt &quot;(see table)&quot; and C/1852 K1 (Chacornac), a parabolic comet in 1852. This comet is thought to be the source of the current Eta Eridanids meteors. He also independently discovered 20 Massalia, which discovery is credited to the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis, however.

Jean Chacornac was awarded the Lalande Prize in 1855, 1856 and in 1863. The asteroid 1622 Chacornac and the lunar crater &quot;Chacornac&quot; are named in his honour.

<text>The Mauritian rupee (sign: Re (singular) and Rs (plural); ISO code: MUR; ) is the currency of Mauritius. One rupee is subdivided into 100 cents. Several other currencies are also called rupee.

==Coins==

In 1877, coins for 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 cents were introduced, with the lower three denominations in copper and the higher two in silver. Coin production ceased in 1899 and did not recommence until 1911, with silver coins not produced again until 1934, when Re. , Re.  and Re. 1/- coins were introduced. In 1947, cupro-nickel 10 cents were introduced, with cupro-nickel replacing silver in 1950.
In 1971 a new set of coins and banknotes were introduced by the Royal Mint. This set has Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse and a range of heraldic motives on the reverse. Some of the reverse designs for this set were designed by Christopher Ironside OBE including the Rs. 10/-, Rs. 200/- and Rs. 250/- (issued 1988).

In 1987, a new series of coins was introduced which, for the first time, did not feature the portrait of the monarch (Mauritius did not become a republic until 1992) but that of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. This coinage consisted of copper-plated-steel 1c and 5c (the 5c was substantially reduced in size), nickel-plated-steel 20c and Re. , and cupro-nickel Re. 1/- and Rs. 5/-. Cupro-nickel Rs. 10/- were introduced in 1997. Coins currently in circulation are the 5c, 20c, Re. , Re. 1/-, Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/- and Rs. 20/-. Coins below Re. 1/- in value are generally regarded as small-change. The 1c coin has not been seen in circulation for many years, and the last series of 1 cent coins issued in 1987 are only seen as collectors&#x27; items.

In 2007, a bi-metallic Rs. 20/- coin was issued to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Bank of Mauritius, and this has now become a coin in general circulation.

==Banknotes==

The first banknotes were issued by the government dated 1876 in denominations of Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/- and Rs. 50/-. Re. 1/- banknotes were added in 1919. In 1940, emergency issues were made of 25c and 50c and Re. 1/-. In 1954, Rs. 25/- and Rs. 1,000/- were introduced.

The Bank of Mauritius was established in September 1967 as the nation&#x27;s central bank and has been responsible for the issue of banknotes and coins since that time. The bank issued its first notes in 1967, comprising four denominations: Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/-, Rs. 25/-, and Rs. 50/-, all undated and featuring a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse. Over the years, some denominations were revised with new signatures of the Bank&#x27;s Governor and managing director but were otherwise unchanged.

In 1985, the Bank of Mauritius issued a completely new set of banknotes of Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/-, Rs. 20/-, Rs. 50/-, Rs. 100/-, Rs. 200/-, Rs. 500/- and Rs. 1,000/-. A close study of these banknotes reveals an interesting array of subsets which were printed by two banknote printing companies (Bradbury Wilkinson and Thomas de La Rue). The banknotes were also designed at different time periods as there are very few identical and consistent design features appearing on all the denominations. Varying banknote numbering systems, different types of security threads, variations in the design and size of the Mauritian Coat of Arms, different ultraviolet light latent printing, inconsistent variations in the size incrementation between the denominations and multiple different typesets are just a few of the differences. This issue lasted up to 1998.

In 1998, The Bank of Mauritius made a new issue of banknotes consisting of 7 denominations, viz. Rs. 25/-, Rs. 50/-, Rs. 100/-, Rs. 200/-, Rs. 500/-, Rs. 1,000/- and Rs. 2,000/-. These banknotes had a standard format and were all issued simultaneously in November 1998. All the banknotes of this issue were printed in England by Thomas de la Rue Limited. These first banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in June 1999 following controversies due to the ordering of the text (English, Sanskrit, Tamil) as the Tamil population is said to have arrived in Mauritius prior to the North Indian community affiliated with Hindi.

The Bank of Mauritius made its latest issue of banknotes, which is still current, after June 1999.

===Currently circulating banknotes===

Each denomination bears a hand engraved portrait of a prominent Mauritian figure, which appears on the left.
The top of the note says &quot;Bank of Mauritius&quot;. The portrait is toward the center-left of the note and below the portrait is the name of the person in the portrait and their year of birth to year of death. On the bottom-left is the coat of arms of Mauritius. There is also a drawing of the Bank of Mauritius building and a portrayal of the statue of justice in the background of each of the denominations in the centre of the note. The value of the note is in the top-right corner with the &quot;Rs&quot; symbol in front the value. Below the value in the top-right corner is a feature to aid the visually impaired. This is in addition to the differences in sizes between the banknotes of various denominations. The left side of the note says the numerical value of the note, with the &quot;Rs&quot; symbol to the left of the value, written sideways left-faced up. On top of the numerical value on the left side is the serial number of the note. The serial number is also on the centre-right of the note. On the top-center of the note is states &quot;This Note Is Legal Tender For&quot;, then it states the note&#x27;s value written out in English (ex: &quot;One Hundred&quot;), and below that it says &quot;Rupees&quot;. Below that it says the value of the note in Tamil, and below that it says the value of the note in Bhojpuri. Below that is the signature of the Governor of the Bank of Mauritius and next to that is the signature of the managing director, or it could have the signatures of the First Deputy Governor, then the Governor, then the Second Deputy Governor. Below that is the year the note was printed.

====Reverse designs====

The top left of the note on the reverse says &quot;Bank of Mauritius&quot;. The left side of the note says the numerical value of the note, with the &quot;Rs&quot; symbol to the left of the value, written sideways left-faced up. The top right of the note has the numerical value of the note with the &quot;Rs&quot; symbol to the left of the value. Each denomination carries a different vignette, depicting various aspects of Mauritius. The Devanagari script value of the note can be found on the left side of the bottom of the vignette, with the Devanagari abbreviation of rupee, &quot;रु&quot; (&quot;ru&quot;) in front of the value. The Tamil and Gujarati numerical value of the note can be found on the right side of the bottom of the vignette. The Tamil value is above the Gujarati value.
